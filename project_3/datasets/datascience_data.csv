1,datascience,Need statistics help for psych essay,"I found a study with a model assessing the effect of economic deprivation on conduct problems. The paper says ‚Äúthe model accounts for 27% of the variance in conduct problems‚Äù. 

Does this mean that economic deprivation accounts for 27% of the variance in conduct problems in the sample of this study? And if this is the case, is it possible to work out how much conduct problems would reduce if economic deprivation did not exist (just hypothetically speaking - and only for the sample in this study). 

Maybe I don‚Äôt understand variance. Not sure. Any help would be appreciated thanks so much. I am trying to estimate how much conduct problems would still exist if poverty was eradicated. If this is wrong, are there any other statistical routes I could take?"
2,datascience,Getting Started with Airflow,"Hello, all! This is more of a question for the Data Engineers here.

I am new to Airflow and Docker. I am trying to do something which seems relatively simple.

I already have an ETL job in Pyspark which can be run with command line arguments 'python [main.py](https://main.py)' style. I understand how to write the dag file under dags/ folder. But, I have a few issues:

1) I don't want to run a method with arguments. I want to run a python script with CLA. Is that doable?

2) Even just designing a dag with Bash operators like 'echo', I can't seem to find the DAG in the Airflow Web UI. How the heck do I put it there?

3) Do I need Docker to solve question 2)?

NB: All of this is happening locally in a Poetry environment.

6,datascience,Question about tourism data from Google Maps?,"Hello,

Firstly, thank you in advance for any comments or advice (or for reading!).

I recently read that it is possible to get data from Google Maps (via data scraping). On that basis I have done some preliminary research into it although it seems a little vague (in terms of the specifics). So I thought I would ask the group to see if there is a simple answer:

Is it possible to get tourism based statistics from google maps (or a close proxy)? I have read that it is possible to get data such as the number of reviews for a specific place, although this seems predicated on the basis that the number of reviewers is transitive to the number of visitors. Is there an alternative metric that does not rely on someone actively typing out a review (either for a town, country, or specific location)?"
7,datascience,Stock Price Prediction_Time Series Model_Train and Test Data modification,"I am participating in a HACKATHON for Stock Market Prediction.

Problem statement:
Predict the Closing price of NASDAQ for 1 week (e.g. 7th Nov to 11th Nov).

I am using the Dataset from the Year 2007-Till Date.

TRAIN DATA: 2007-2018
TEST DATA:2019-TILL Date.

Model: ARIMA

Challenge:
The Train Data contains the 2008 crash scenario and the Test Data contains the COVID crash.

These 2 events were outlier and I do not expect them to happen again in the Prediction Period (7th Nov -11th Nov)

If I Train and Test Model on this type of Data (containing outliers) then the Model  will take into account these scenarios while making prediction.

Should I alter the Train and Test Data to remove these outlier events and replace them with synthetic data.

Any advice is appreciated"

13,datascience,Looking for Advice,"Hi everyone -- new to the community here, so apologies if this should be posted somewhere else / something similar has already been answered (just lmk). 

I recently graduated in May 2022 and am currently working in finance, but I really enjoyed coding / data analysis in college (I was a stats / data science major). I'm thinking of maybe switching to the data science field in 1-2 years and was wondering what courses / bootcamps / education are necessary to land an entry-level data scientist role (ideally remote / in NYC). For context, my undergrad is prob considered a top 5 institution, but its data science program is not the strongest -- mostly focused on just R (no Python or SQL), so I would def need improvement in Python, SQL, and ML in general. 

Basically, I'm looking for advice on how to improve my Python / SQL skills (e.g., any online courses that I could do on weekends, etc.) and also wondering if a Master's is really necessary to land an entry-level data scientist role? I've seen some data scientist jobs prefer or require a Master's, but wasn't sure how beneficial a Master's would be. On the other hand, I've seen many jobs ask for 1-4 years of relevant work experience in data science, but other than my recent stats/data science major, I've mostly only done econ or finance-related internships (and am currently full-time in finance), so not sure what's the best path to get an entry-level data scientist position here (i.e. can I do it without a Master's and just study on the weekends, or would a Master's be the most helpful here?).

Sorry for the jumble of words, and thank you in advance!! Any advice would be much appreciated :)"

- There‚Äôs no way to expand my skill set in my current role to be more marketable

What I mostly did as an intern was help my team extract and clean up data using excel, tested some internal websites, and mostly data entry at a beginner level. I was very comfortable with excel and even helped on some dashboards that were presented to upper level management on a weekly basis. But I learned very quickly and was also introduced to SQL, Tableau, and BoA's in house systems. Overall I enjoyed doing this type of work which led me into my interested into this career field. I am currently also working on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate in order to supplement my experiences and alongside my Education. I am very highly passionate in this field and believe I can pick up the knowledge very quickly. I am very adequate with excel and the concepts of coding(I am not a coder). SQL, R, Python, and Tableau or even other programs seem knew to me but I can learn them just as efficient. I recently also did a project with R in one of my economics class in statistical analysis, which I learned R by myself (on a beginner level) within a span of 2 weeks just to code the project and got B+. Would this be enough to attain a job or future internships that could lead into the data analysis field? I am so close to graduating and would like some thoughts/advice. Thank you."

31,datascience,Question about ML models assumptions left unmet.,"Hi everyone =) I just wanted to ask a quick question now that I am more familiar with ML models.

I have read and read many articles stating the (sometimes many) assumptions of different models, be it linear or logistic regression, support vector machines, and so on. All these articles teach you how to check for these assumptions, but they don't tell you *what assumptions* ***must*** *be held for the model to be implemented effectively.* 

Some of them I can deduct myself: if there is no linear relationship between X and y you shouldn't force a linear regression on it, for example. If the outcome is not binary you shouldn't force logistic regression on it. And so on. But others I don't know how to evaluate, and with what level of stringency they need to be met before you throw out the model altogether and try something else.

What if the points in the QQ plot are not *perfectly* linear and some values escape the line at the beginning and end of the graph while being still mostly linear? What there is *some* heteroscedasticity in the residuals? Do you get rid of *all* influential outliers? Can you leave some in? How do you justify these decisions?

I feel like there are plenty of tutorials out there on how to check on assumptions for plenty of models, but I am struggling to find ones that take the time to explain in detail to what degree certain assumptions can be left unmet before you have to throw out the model altogether and think of another approach. Any suggestions for reads? Links?"

To synthesize/reconstruct  images in this scale, I am using a sigmoid activation function in the  output/last layer.

However, a problem with sigmoid activation function is that it is  almost linear in the middle and then saturates towards the ends. This  means that you need a large input to have a small/negligible output in  these saturated zones. As a result, extreme values are usually not  predicted by the network. For example, for a given target image, if the  max value = 0.998, the max predicted value = 0.688, and therefore a good  amount of difference is present. A similar situation can be seen for  min values between true and predicted values.

Is there a way to avoid this sigmoid bias for the output layer? I am  also assuming that because of this, the reconstruction loss also  increases."

One might argue that the inconsistency is appropriate since the DS in the latter group will be more quant-heavy.

59,datascience,Advice: Should I add a Data Scientist to my Marketing Analytics team,"Context: I oversee marketing analytics team for a large organization that owns many smaller companies. The company is currently transitioning into an enterprise mindset and is trying to uniform the SFDB for each of these companies. Holistically, it's not ready for deep analytics and we spend a lot of time building/hacking together BI reports and working to automate a slew of marketing data connections into a central DB. Busy + working on foundations on the fly is the key take away here. Not a ton of analytics actually going on.

One of these companies has the data volume, internal resources, and data framework that would be needed to double down into actual analytic investigation. After showing them how it is impossible to find actionable insights on marketing strategy with our current ecosystem, they caught the vision that we need to design proper modeling/testing vs eyeballing - and that the upside is enormous.

There is appetite to start designing marketing tests to optimize for revenue and diminishing return. However, we need someone who can embed with this group and navigate what type of data environment they need to answer the questions we want to ask, educate leadership and developers in building the data environment, and then lead them in building test arms. Finally, assessing results + iterating.

I recently got the buy-in to add headcount to our team. I'm not sure what resource to add though. We have 2 data analysts who are eager to lean and apply more data science. I don't know if we should come in with a net new data science 'heavy hitter' to establish enterprise standards, a data engineer, or let my team learn to navigate this on top of their other responsibilities.

63,datascience,How should I go about learning this?,"There are things my degree (MSc in EE) didn't teach me about, and these are things that might be the most ""valuable"" to a company if I want to go into DS/MLE. Stuff like Recommendation Systems/ Bandits, Time Series, GLMs, etc... These are also things that interest me a lot.

How should I go about learning these things and show on my CV that I have experience in them? I do have some knowledge of these topics because I took a Machine Learning and a Deep Learning course (among others) but I have to recognize we didn't talk about them that deeply.

I guess one way would be to do Kaggle problems but I feel like Kaggle gets a bad rep sometimes... Are there any books or courses you'd recommend to learn about these topics?"
64,datascience,What should I learn to switch tracks into DS?,"I am currently a senior in my undergrad who has a major in Data Analytics and a minor in Statistics. I used to have a major in Data Science, but dropped it for my analytics so I could graduate a year earlier and focus more on actual experiences than classes. At this point, it's too late to switch back, and even if it wasn't, I'm not sure I would want to.

I have almost all of my knowledge in R and SQL. I have had a BI internship and I work with my university's baseball team so I get a lot of very good experience to work on these skills constantly. Without sounding arrogant, I know I am quite advanced in analytics (at least compared to most others at my school), and I worry that I will end up working my way up through a job in analytics to a project manager role or non analytics role where I don't program at all. As I would love to work my way up, I also am more interested in programming and I love the idea of learning more and more complex methods as I progress in my career.

With all that being said, I want to know where to start? I understand the basics of data science, considering I have the programming knowledge from analytics and statistics skills from my minor. I have some baseline knowledge of Python and kinda want to learn more Python now, since I feel that R has a ceiling to its learning at this point.

But what specifically should I work on? I use DataCamp to teach myself different things and I plan on using this a lot, but I'm not sure what is most beneficial to me. So far, I know pretty advanced data wrangling and visualizations, linear modeling, many different statistical tests, random sampling, and basics of machine learning like random forest a k-means clustering. If I want to upgrade my knowledge into a data scientist, what else will I need to know?

(I know there's thousands of blogs and websites talking about this, but I wanted to know from real data scientists about what they think of my situation in particular)"
65,datascience,Borda Count Calculation Question,"Currently debating the way we're going to implement an algorithm change for an opinion ranking tool. Would really appreciate any opinions on the scenarios below!

\---

Imagine 100 people participated in a simple ranking exercise where they were asked to rank 10 options from 1st (most important) to 10th (least important). Participants were allowed to submit incompletes as long as they included 2 or more of the 10 options. Would you expect the scoring algorithm to:

1. Calculate the score for each option based only on the total number of participants who \*included\* that option in their personal ranking.
2. Assume that any non-inclusions were the equivalent of a last-place rank, giving 0 points in those cases and therefore using the total 100 participants when calculating the overall score for each option.

We currently use Glicko-2 to score ranking options. Due to Glicko-2's comparative format, we often see researchers include new ranking options mid-project, adding additional participants until the ratings deviation reaches a similar level to the original ranking options. While we can replicate this format with Borda Counts using method 1 above, I would imagine the majority of researchers would expect the survey to use method 2.

An optional third method would be to combine the two initial options -- to rank newly-added options based on all participants that saw it, ie. using method 2 but only using a total count of 60 participants if the new options was added after the 40th person submitted their findings.

Interested to hear what you think? We've found that Glicko-2 is a black box for researchers and therefore they can't ensure their findings will be adopted and trusted when people disagree with the results."

For reasons not in my control, we are not doing  dashboards (not my call), and I need to get multiple PM's multiple files on a regular basis. 

I am using Jupyter notebook hooked up directly to our Redshift database. I figured I could save myself some work by uploading the notebooks to Google Colab (the company is already on G-Suite), and then the PM's can just run the script, which will automatically pull the data, do the manipulations, and download the CSV for them to use. 

When I tried this, notebooks that ran in 2 minutes or less in Jupyter resulted in run times so long in Colab that the connection to Redshift was shut down.

84,datascience,Struggles with first job in data field,"Hello,

I have just finished my master's in business administration and started looking for my first job in data analytics or data science. I have had 6 courses about programming, and one of them was basically about the completion of 4 data science projects. My master's thesis was a great pain for me, but I managed to make it work (simulation with evolution algorithm for a popular logistics problem). I am also learning some stuff from my family on the run (my brother is doing a computer science degree, my husband is a data engineer).
In addition, I have speedrun one popular data science course on some online learning platform, where I also had some data science related stuff to do. I made the course quickly since I had already learned most of the stuff at the university.

Now I am starting to receive refusals to my job applications. How do I go about it? Should I go after each and every company to ask why they turned me down or should I just move on with my day and keep spamming job applications? 

This is so frustrating. I thought I had worked up some half decent portfolio that would reduce the number of refusals. I don't know how I should feel about this tedious recruiting process. I started applying just this weekend, but this frustration feeling is so overwhelming for me that I really start thinking I should just stop trying and quit for good. How can I cope with this situation? 

Honestly I feel so tired of having to work my ass off every time I have to make a next major step in my life. 

Any feedback is appreciated. 

In case it's important, I've put together my CV in latex, it's one page, looking alright.

Another detail, which is probably important too, I am a female with two kids, and I have been working in business consulting over the last five years. I don't maintain any social media, so the recruiters probably don't know about the kids; however, in Europe we are required to disclose photos to CVs, so maybe I'm too ugly or whatever? I didn't use any beach photo of course.

Thank you!"

2. We are looking for something that fans out as the sample size increases as shown in the second picture. So far the only solution I have been able to figure out is by modifying the slopes of the max and min forecast lines but that takes away the statistical accuracy.

Over the past 6 years, I've picked up beginner to intermediate level skills in R, Tableau, PowerBI - enough to make a mark in my immediate work environment. Things were looking positive where I was reporting into the Chief Data Officer and working on various projects to help business &amp; ad revenue. Unfortunately a few months back, along with the entire unit I was laid off and have been hunting for job opportunities. 

So this offer to be part of a Data Science team has come my way. They needed someone with the domain experience to help them build various tools for media clients. It seemed to make sense for me in the short-term.

Long run however, i'm not too sure. It puts me in the path where I'm genuinely competing with candidates who are much younger and possibly with better DS skills than myself. Whatever I've picked up is by grinding on my own. I foresee myself competing with peers who may be specialists in DS. 

I confess to not really building any prediction models or any ML algos at my workplace. I'm better at data wrangling and insight-generation as I know exactly what I'm looking for. Within a DS company, I fear this may not cut too deep.

I am also exploring a project of my own in a jupyter notebook I hope will be pretty cool to have on my github (which is sparse beyond a small python program from a lab job). 
* Several publications in academic journals (first and secondary authorship)
* **6 years experience in R and SAS;** about **3 years in Python and SQL** (intermediate proficiency) 
* I am looking to **program more, expand my analytical skill set and be in a position for growth** (none of which I have in my job currently). 
* Hoping to stay in healthcare, biology, or related fields
* Remote, hybrid in NYC or DC markets preferred  


When I apply to places, I feel like I am *just outside* what folks are looking for... has anyone pivoted in this way?  What would you recommend I do to break through? I am not opposed to more education via bootcamp or an additional Master's."

My significant domain experience is the primary reason I got this job. The tech skill requirements were considerably reduced for that reason. One soft factor that I think helped was my story of leaving a lucrative career that I hated to pursue DS, and verifiable effort in that direction evidenced by taking some courses at a real university, just to refresh my linear algebra and statistics and get a bit of data visualization in my toolbox."

121,datascience,Data Driven Personas as a spectrum,"I lead a data science function for a large global fintech company. I‚Äôm preparing a talk for the org next week about being a true data driven org and I want to get peoples‚Äô feedback/input on an idea that‚Äôs floating around my head.

No matter who I ask the question of, ‚ÄúAre you a data driven person?‚Äù. The answer is always yes. Knowing these people and how they engage with insights, I used to immediately think ‚Äúno you certainly are not!‚Äù. I‚Äôve since shifted away from this binary way of thinking and believe that behind every ‚ÄúYes I am‚Äù answer there exists some truth. Each self declared data driven person exists on some sort of spectrum of ability/aptitude towards using data to make decisions. Now I‚Äôm not talking about role based reporting or anything like that. Because even within any defined role, you will have different types of people. Two executives could be very different in their ‚Äòdata driven-ness‚Äô, but exist within the one role. One exec may prefer interacting with data, while another may prefer flat insights for example. One exec may expect insights to provide the final decision, while the other may understand insights are just the beginning of the decision making process.

I‚Äôve since changed my team‚Äôs delivery approach to meet this idea of different types of data driven people. Shaping the same story differently, depending on the customer. Anyways, I plan to talk about this way of thinking next week and would like your thoughts. Is there anything out there already about a spectrum of data driven abilities/personas? Am I wrong in thinking this way? Anything I can expand into?"

It doesn't seem healthy as a mental framework for the long run.

To break myself off from feeling that way I thought I'd take up a fun little project, everything would be literal make-believe. No business idea or fancy API conversion to create value or problem solving. I mean there would be quirky questions and fun stuff, but I'd try not to make it from a point of impressing someone. 

Soon after, my mind started bashing me for thinking that way! **Ultimately, utility is the supreme sorcerer** it screamed. Could be true, coz it rhymes haha. 

But Idk how to feel about this? I feel like there is this trade-off between the two - Utility and being pointlessly fun with things you do. I hope that they're not binary, nothing in the world is...but I wanted to know where's the sweet spot between the two?

131,datascience,Seeking advice on pursuing a career in data science with a business/management consulting background,"Hi r/datascience,

Sorry if this comes off as a common post, but just wanted to get people's sincere thoughts - really appreciate anyone's opinions. 

For context, I have \~4 YOE as a management consultant where I did a variety of strategic projects that were relatively analytical in nature such as PE due diligence, market sizing, survey analysis, etc. However, I've disliked the client pleasing aspect of the profession, and since then I have found a new job as a business operations analyst in big tech, where I'm essentially an internal consultant for the company doing varying degrees of analysis (and occasionally using SQL to pull datasets and analyze them). 

Clearly I don't have the technical background or experience that a lot of DS folks have to enter the market (I've never really coded, I don't use R or Python at work), but I've always been curious about the field of data science, and been relatively good with numbers/logical thinking. Plus, I've been realizing more and more that I'd like to develop some type of deep expertise/knowledge, rather than stay a generalist consulting-type person for my career over the long run. Therefore, I'm getting more curious about attaining more analytical/technical skills and possibly pursing a data science career.  

I'm wondering now given my background and experience, where in the Data Science realm would be a good fit for me to leverage my business background but at the same time get more exposure to analytics. Wondering if trying to become a pure Data Scientist would be too much of an uphill climb given my knowledge gaps and how most people in the field have MS/PhDs, and if shooting for a role like Data Analyst would be a better fit for me. At the same time, given the perception I've seen here that Data Analysts have relatively limited career potential, I'd love to get candid thoughts on that too. 

That being said, I'd be willing to do further learning (bootcamps, masters) if it's worth it, but again not sure how much it would be given the competition. As an aside I was looking at the general assembly part time data science bootcamp to get some flavor of what it's like to work on data science problems, but I'm feeling a bit existential after reading all the reddit posts that roast bootcamps as scams.

Apologies if I'm touching on a lot of different topics here, but would love any insights/general advice - thanks so much!

132,datascience,Salary Question: (Jr?) Data Scientist,"TL;DR

Evaluating role and pay at a potential job offer, listing some of the responsibilities and tech stack, as well as my current experience, responsibilities, and TC.

Hello all,

Curious to know if 100-110K base salary + 10% bonus, yet 0 stock equity until more senior role is good for a remote Data Scientist? For context, it looks like specific experience and Master‚Äôs program/ training is preferred but NOT required - I have .5 YOE post undergrad, about 2 YOE total that the recruiter seemed to like via phone interview (based off accomplishments within those technical internships).

I like my current team and company a lot, but not using many of my technical skills and also going into a Master‚Äôs program for analytics that‚Äôll only develop these further.

Looks like emphasis is on Business Intelligence, data cleansing, heavy SQL. Some example of Python or R experience is required along with ML, knowledge of Tableau and AWS Lambda preferred.

Communication is supposedly huge with this role as it‚Äôs a very small team, with several projects involving talks with senior leadership/ executives - one of my only strong suits outside Tableau and some SQL that I hope to leverage during any further behavioral interview rounds. I have basic experience with a Python project, mentioned the value of the Master‚Äôs that has heavy Python + R and ML I can apply to the role.

While I have a small set of RSUs that vest every year boosting my TC around 5K or so depending on performance, this role would be a 45-65% pay increase depending on bonus and official base salary, transitioning into a much more technical role - I‚Äôm entering an online Master‚Äôs program for Analytics next spring, so I do really like this aspect.

Company is IT Consulting with a SaaS product they offer, not as much brand name as CrowdStrike but still reputable and huge upgrade title/ TC wise. Seems more like a Jr Data Scientist given the lack of a required 2-3 YOE, some mix of BI Analyst/ Data Engineer which I don‚Äôt mind at all.

Basically curious what thoughts are on the expected TC, whether it‚Äôs competitive with the new role given requirements and my current experience? Thanks!"

I've always been super interested in IT and programming, having completed various small projects of my own, especially prior to med school.

I don't have any particular specific interests within the field (as of yet!) but I am excited to explore everything it has to offer. For now, I am particularly interested (in principle) in NLP and medical decision support systems. 

The MSc starts in October and I have been absolutely hammering linear algebra, statistics, R (only R as of yet, as the pre-course recommendations were to take a bunch of R courses on Datacamp), and a bit of calculus for the past couple of months. 

I suppose my question is: What is the hireability of someone like me, namely someone with specialist medical knowledge combined with data science knowledge? Will this Master's equip me to get employed in the field? What else could I do to increase my hireability? And finally, what sort of roles would fit me and my qualifications; would it be managerial? Data scientist? Consultancy position?

140,datascience,"My controversial opinion: DS teams are a luxury at most companies, and many will be let go as budgets shrink","I have zero data to back this up. But this is my anecdotal impression after years in the trade.

There was a period of 5-10 years where executives heard big promises about ‚Äúdata science‚Äù and ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù and ‚ÄúAI‚Äù. A mindset developed that any serious company had a team working on ‚ÄúData Science‚Äù. Sometimes, these teams just replicated traditional BI functions (albeit with much better technology). Other times, they just produced useless reports and models that don‚Äôt do much. The rare companies that turned DS into a value-adding function have started selling that as a standalone product. There are few remaining functions that can be automated or simplified using basic DS.

Now interest rates are rising, profits are falling, decision makers are looking to run leaner. I think a lot of DS teams that were just a luxury in easy times will get cut. Those that do basically BI work will see salary and maybe title adjustments to reflect what they actually do. Probably just salary adjustments though. Which means saying you work in DS will soon mean ‚ÄúI run SQL queries and create dashboards for a living.‚Äù

I‚Äôm very much looking for convincing arguments to the contrary. But I‚Äôve been getting pretty cynical lately."

For the last two weeks, I have been taking extensive Power BI courses on Data Camp (out of my own pocket), however, my boss has concerns about me spending so much time doing this if, in the end, we won't adopt using it. Lately, I've been feeling that my data analysis skills have plateaued and won't get any better without further studying new tools and ways to manipulate data.

1. Software is too cumbersome
2. Software will require additional funding
3. Software will be too complex or have too much of a learning curve for executives

The course I'm on teaches me a lot of, how to do things and not why to do things.

From what I understand, I want to use SmartCorrelatedSelection to drop any variables that share similar correlation because it uses up time and resources training an ML Model to use identical sets of data. Is that right?

In my project, at the end of the feature engineering section the learning material on my course instructs me to use SmartCorrelatedSelection, but 4 of the 8 variables that's it's wanting to drop are my strongest predictors (highest PPS and pearson and spearman corr scores) of the target variable. Isn't that the complete opposite of what I want?

Should I let this happen, or should I change the selection\_method? I'm using the selection\_method = variance, as that was what's suggested but that doesn't seem right to me. Why would I even want the chosen variable between those that are dropped to be the one with higher variance? Isn't it easier for an ML model to make predictions if the data has less variance? 

What if one of the variables it wanted to drop were my target variable?

in terms of income, i live in a low cost part of the US. I need to be up to $80k to 100k in 3-5 years. At least that‚Äôs the goal. My thoughts, I‚Äôm taking a big financial hit changing careers. I need that to offset with higher salary so I can bank $ in the last 10 years of work before I retire.

I am in a dilemma if I am doing the right thing or not.

To do some projects ideas,  I‚Äôve been doing webscrapping to get the data. Eventually I saw this scrapping thing as a must to have in this area ( at least initially to show some projects or working as a freelancer) but now I was thinking if I didn‚Äôt go to a ‚Äúrabbit hole‚Äù?

Do I postpone this ‚Äúspecialization‚Äù in scrapping and I look for data more straightforward or public and do some data science from there?

186,datascience,Meta: how has data(science) affected society and how do you feel about it?,"I think that data and computers always attracted me. They provide an environment that's perfectly rational, deterministic yet inaccessible and immaterial. The digital world is as close to a reality without uncertanty we'll ever get. Yet it feels as mysterious, if not more, as the rest of reality. But somehow it feels confortable to know it can be understood and every time you're taken by surprise you're to blame.

Paradoxically I think I'm repulsed by the effect the digital world is having on the rest of reality. We've been using digital technology for decades now to make reality more rational and deterministic, and I'd guess I'd like that - but I don't think I do. That dislike has been steadily growing in me over the past two decades.

I recently realized that's mainly caused by how we use data. 20 years ago data was mainly used to test theories individuals made up. The vast increase in available data is changing that very rapidly: it now has become some sort of fabric over reality - increased resolution of reality towards the digital world - that almost any seemingly can be answered better usinig data. In some cases it becomes harder and harder to say if that's really true since already available data is used to prove our theories - instead it's gathered to test a theory. Machine learning and the effect of big data on human behaviors is a catalyst for this issue ofc.

But I know it's not as bad as I make it sound and we answer most questions more efficient, faster and more accurate now. But you see where I'm going right? In a philosophical sense the material aspect of reality is becoming less accessible. How do you feel about this? I feel like we - being the masters of data - should be on the forefront of this conversation and try to raise awareness of potential indirect and adverse effects the focus on data can have. Without spreading fear, that is, because nodoby gains from more cookiewalls or privacy fanatics. Apart from big data companies ofc - a bitter irony."

To achieve this goal I decided to index the whole Polish Wikipedia into a graph and check out what is the longest path of all shortest path between any two Wikipedia articles.  
The way it works is for each node it runs the BFS algorithm and the last visited node is furthest from the starting node. And after running BFS for all nodes it finds out what is the actual diameter of Wikipedia.  


So for Polish Wikipedia, it took around a week to index and check all combinations and the longest path is from Drzewa\_dyskryminacyjne (Discrimination trees) to Gare\_de\_Strasbourg-Roethig and it's 51 articles apart. And this is how it goes:

https://old.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/wtif20/how_to_follow_up_a_month_after_interview_for/

I emailed the main person who handled my interview a month previously, and she was like ""Oh right sorry, we really need to talk let's chat in a couple of days.""

We chatted for about an hour in a lot of detail, and it's a sort of good news/not too-bad-news type situation.

I wasn't a perfect fit for the job I interviewed for, and they are trying to create a somewhat different position for me there, and are currently trying to figure out the job title etc. So basically she was like ""We are going to offer you a job, but it will probably be somewhat different from the exact title in the one we posted at the site"".  

Honestly, this is fair, as I am not 100% a good fit for the job posted, but I am a good fit for a need at the company, which is sort of a weird mixture of low-level data science who writes code and does PRs at github, but also provides support for users more than most writers of code (I am not as mathematically savvy as most of their developers who tend to be math PhDs, while I am a science PhD with moderate math/quant skills. I am also more social/helpful than their usual developer who tends to answer Github issues in a pretty curmudgeonly way). 

The down side is reading between the lines the new position will probably mean less money but we didn't talk about money even for the original position yet, and the title will probably be less prestigious and have less cache. Something like 'developer water boy' or something.

So it isn't a flat out rejection, they weren't ghosting me, they were trying to figure out what to do with me. She also said in the meantime they would like to hire me as a contractor because they really like the work I do with them, so that's cool."

232,datascience,I am looking into data science as a career and have a few questions,"I hope I'm in the right place. Please let me know where else I can post to ask for advice.

My background: I graduated in december with a degree in psychology. For my senior project, I ran a study, and was responsible for design, data collection, data analysis, and data interpretation. I have taken a statistics course for my degree (we used SPSS), as well as a research methods course. I also have a small background in IT: I got an A+ certification around 2015-2016, and have worked in various student helpdesk/technician positions in school. Lastly, I am already somewhat familiar with Google sheets (but not excel), as I use it frequently to keep a budget. I know very basic functions related to math and reference. I love working with numbers; I love the way they making real life easier to understand as well as more scientifically accurate. I also have inattentive ADHD.

I am exploring various career options and data science seems right up my alley. I have a few questions about the field/profession:

What does a typical day look like for a data analyst?
What are pros/cons to being a data analyst?
Which data analysis course should I take? They seem to have different focuses (eg, Google vs Microsoft products), which is best for me?
I am bad at being self-directed (which is why I'm afraid of online courses because there's usually no accountability), are there good options for community colleges or are online courses my best bet? I'm based in San Antonio, TX.
Is scheduling usually flexible? Options to work from home?
How is the work-life balance?
Can I listen to music while I'm working or no?

Anything else I need to know about the field would be appreciated. Thank you all!"

I would prefer a path that doesn't involve a Bachelor since most of the 1st year of it is a waste of time (at least here), and the learning pace is also too slow. 

Any tips on courses and the main things that I should look into it? And if bachelor is the go to way, which one should I aim for?"

250,datascience,[Long post] Had something happen to me during an interview that's making me second guess if I want to continue down this career path. Thoughts?,"**First of all, apologies for the long post. I just want to be as detailed as possible so you all know where I'm coming from.**

So, I'm in my late 20's and I've been working as a Data Analyst within the public policy industry for a little over a year and a half, and have been programming (mostly SQL and Python) and studying analytics for that same amount time. Prior to this, I worked in the aerospace manufacturing industry as Quality Engineering and had very little exposure to coding and programming. I made the switch to analytics because of a machine learning course that I took during my undergrad studying Economics. I hated working as an engineer, absolutely loved the machine learning course, and new right away that I wanted to make the switch to data science and analytics. 

After about 100+ applications and 30 or so interviews, the company that I'm currently at gave me a chance to work as a Data Analyst, which I really appreciate. So far I've really enjoyed my job and although at times I still feel like I have imposter syndrome, my supervisor and colleagues are constantly telling me how well I'm doing and how happy they are with my work. About two months ago, my dream company (which more than likely 9/10 people won't know what it is) was looking to hire an entry level BI Analyst, so I applied. I've applied to this company countless times (30+ times), have landed three interviews for data related roles prior to this, and was rejected each time bc of a lack of technical experience. This time I felt confident bc I had been working as a Data Analyst for 1.5 years and was able to beef up my resume with some good skills and projects. The interview process this time around was a complete nightmare. 

This time around, they incorporated a take home project, where they provided me a prompt with some data, and I needed to come up with some insights using analytical techniques. I tried my absolute best and took about 8 hours to complete the assignment. Come presentation time, I was interviewed by a Data Science Manager and Senior BI Analyst. Throughout the entire presentation I was getting a vibes that they hated and were confused by what I was presenting, and on top of that the DS Manager would cut me off every 10 seconds to aggressively question why I did certain things. I just knew right away that he wasn't happy with my work. 

At the end of the interview I said I enjoyed the project and asked if I would have the opportunity to answer other complex questions similar to it. The DS Manager then said super passive aggressively that this was an extremely easy assignment and the things that'd I'd be working on would be way more difficult. I knew right away that I wasted 8 hours and wasn't moving forward. Throughout the entire interview he was being so condescending, said nothing positive the entire time, and it was honestly so frustrating bc of how much time I invested into it. All in all, they did not treat this position as if it was an entry level role. They left no room for any errors and expected the candidate to know how to answer the question perfectly, which imo is asking for too much from a junior employee. 

Fast forward to this week - I landed another interview with this company, and the recruiter told me that this role was way more difficult than the BI Analyst role, which made me question why he even moved my application forward. Fucking beyond stupid. He then said he would talk to the team to see what they say and if they wanted to move me forward. The next day he emailed me literally saying that I did terrible on my last interview/presentation (the BI Analyst role), and that my last role that I interviewed for was the easiest role he recruits for and that I would struggle big time with this role. The worst part was that he pretty much said I sucked and provided no feedback as to how I could improve or what I could've done differently. This made me feel like absolute crap, and imo they were 100% not looking for someone entry level or junior. Idk I'm just feeling really down about myself and questioning whether or not I can succeed in this industry. How do you think the recruiter and hiring team handled this situation? 

But yeah, it's hard to describe their tones, but they were absolute dicks the entire time and it completely changed the way I look at this company now. The first three times I interviewed there, the interviewers and recruiters were beyond pleasant, and I have no idea what happened this time around. I'm sure a lot of you are going to say that that's life and you get rejected and you move on, but there is something about this situation that just completely broke me. I've interviewed probably 50+ times in my life and a rejection has never made me feel this shitty about myself. 

Also, if anyone is interested, this is the project that I presented. Even though the solution may be wrong, I feel like the code is good enough to land a junior role and I laid out my thought and analytical process decently well. Keep in mind I've only been coding for a little over a year and half, but idk maybe I do suck.

A little background on me:

I have a little over a year of industry experience and a PhD in mathematics. I make $110K annual salary at my current position where I work 100% remote. I have been looking for a new job since I \*think\* I'm underpaid for my experience and education; my current company seems a bit like a sinking ship; and there isn't room to grow or move up. One of my projects is awesome and I have been able to create something I'm really proud of, but other than maintenance/a few tweaks here and there it's basically done. However, the other project I have been assigned has been cursed from the start, and I honestly don't want to be associated with it at all. I've voiced my concerns to people in my department, outside of my department, heads of departments and shown them evidence of why the whole thing is a fragile pile of steaming shit, and no one listens. The company has many projects like this and they normally waste a couple years on them before they blow up in their face and finally get dropped. I've been told ""that's just how corporations are"" and it's ""good experience"". I do appreciate that my department understands what a waste of time this is, but they have no power over anything, so we just try to mitigate the crappiness and say ""it is what it is"".  That said, I love my team and they love me, but most have been moving on over the last year (and generally haven't been getting replaced).

Thus, I've been casually applying for new jobs, and the ones I've applied for are exclusively remote because I love where I live, but it's not exactly a tech hub. And in all honesty, I prefer using my own bathroom and that alone is probably worth about $10K annually to me. I've been asked to apply with big companies that have contacted me on LinkedIn, but aren't remote jobs. I've followed through with one because they have a great reputation and the job sounds like a great fit. I was originally told the pay would be in the $140-145K range. However, I was recently informed I was originally told wrong and it would be more in the $130-140 range. I understand that the city I would have to move to has a relatively low cost of living, but there's a reason it's cheap to live there.

I also just found out that the remote job I'm most into at the moment (newish-start up type situation, and I vibe really well with everyone I've interviewed with) has a salary range of $100-120K. I originally thought I would only leave my current job for another remote job with at least $130K base salary, and an onsite/hybrid job for at least $140K base (depending on location, I told someone in Texas I would move there for no less than $500K).

Are my expectations unreasonable? What pay range should I be expecting? Should I be considering lateral moves? At this point in my career, should I just take the job with the big company for the experience? Is it more important that my personality clicks like with the smaller start up? Should I just wait for the perfect remote job to fall into my lap?"

294,datascience,Advice for accounting major looking to switch plans and try to go into data science instead?,"I'm an accounting &amp; information systems double major currently a senior on track to graduate spring 2023, however I've recently changed my mind about accounting. I'm far more interested in stats and computer science, and felt like data science would be the perfect career for me instead. 

Because I'm deciding this pretty late in my major, it's pretty hard for me to switch undergrads and it would end up taking a very long time if I even can to finish the degree. Luckily, since I'm an accounting major I have been taking extra credits so that I would be eligible to take the cpa (needs more credits than any bachelor's will provide), and all of those extra credits have been in math/compsci courses, so I'm not starting from absolutely nothing. 

My current plan is to start applying to masters programs and hopefully get into one starting summer/fall 2023. I am planning to drop 1 of my majors (likely accounting unless people recommend otherwise) and take more stat/cs courses in the meantime, possibly even getting a minor if that would help my odds for admission to grad schools. 

My question is, which programs would be best for a career in data science? So far I'm just looking at DS/DA masters. although I have heard some people recommending to just get a statistics or comp sci masters instead, as DS masters can be all over the place and many employers might not favor them. Personally I think I would prefer to do a DS program as I don't think I'd be able to handle grad level pure stats, and I'm uninterested in low level programming that I assume most CS masters would have, but I'm not ruling it out. Some people say to try to do a PHD and drop out with a masters, as PHD programs are paid. A third alternative I have heard recommended is to try to get an entry level data analyst role and self learn from there.

Here are all the masters programs I've added to my application list in no particular order. I am also ONLY considering in-person programs. I've heard many master's can be scammy/cash cows so I'm trying to avoid those when adding to my list.

295,datascience,easy image tagging with multilabel classification,"Hello everyone,

I have a simple question, yet after some queries on google I find myself at a bit of a loss. For an experiment I want to run, I need to tag several hundred pictures. Pictures are sceneries (lanscapes, streets etc.) and I want to have multiple labels per pic (e.g., sea, boat, cloud etc.). I thought I'd see if I can script something to help me with that.

My understanding is that most libraries that allow you to do this kind of task will require that you train a model first (e.g., using opencv). However, I was hoping that there would be something with a pretrained model that I could use, more like an API I guess where I'd provide the pic and retrieve a list of tags with probabilities. I have played a bit with VGG16 and ResNet50 (with weights based on imagenet) using Keras but to be honest, so far the results are not particularly good when I look at the output and what my sample pictures actually contain. Some pics have better results than others of course.

From what I see, there may otherwise be something worth looking into using AWS Rekognition although I would rather use something free/oss if possible. Of course if it's a complex task that inevitably requires training a model, then I may pay for the service if it's worth it.

I understand that fundamentally it's a simple yet complicated task to do because pictures can contain so many different elements within them. But I figured I'd ask anyway in case there is something obvious I am missing.

Thanks in advance!"

The last few months have been a hectic and depressing ordeal of continously scaling things back as my work got scooped (I need published papers for my program) from multiple angles leaving me with very little novelty remaining. 

I'm concerned if I leave that I will be seen as incompetent and be stuck in an unemployability trap of being too old for graduate schemes yet not enough commercial experience for a mid level position. Does anyone have any idea how I would spin an incomplete PhD on my CV? I'm still passionate about machine learning and data science and I still want to work in this field, furthermore I've learnt a lot after making what was (at the time) some novel transformer architectures that achieved state of the art performance in my field but I'm concerned that if I try to sell this work the response will just be ""why dont you have the PhD then?"".  

Does anyone else have a similar experience to me? I'm concerned that a stigma from leaving the program + a lack of commercial experience may make getting a job in this field very difficult, and I'm concerned I'm now specialised enough that I'll struggle to get a job outside of it."
309,datascience,Advice for Rising Junior majoring in Data Science,"Hey r/datascience, I'm a rising junior at a respectable university majoring in data science. For the first 1.5 years of college I was a biology major, but made the switch to DS recently. Next summer I hope to land an internship at a reputable company (debating between Big Data / Tech / Finance / Consulting industries). I know each of these fields have different requirements, and that DS has lots of different parts, so I've spent the majority of the past 2 months understanding the data pipeline, types of careers, languages used, and daily tasks in each respective career. 

I've come to the conclusion that I want to be either a Data Scientist or Data Analyst out of college, primarily working with programming in Python (maybe SQL later too) and also perhaps being involved with communication with other parties, such as other departments in the company and/or clients.

Realistically I have 5 months (till the end of 2022) to become a legitimate candidate for a top internship, so I want to optimize how I create my own technical skillset and portfolio. However, I've reached a hurdle: I don't know what resources to use to go forward. I have tried watching tutorials for data analysis in pandas/numpy/matplotlib on YouTube. I've also attempted a few courses on Kaggle (though haven't really pushed through and completed any of them because I find them extremely boring - I'm more of a do and learn person rather than read and do). I've looked at things like Google's Data Analytics Certificate but figured it wasn't worth my time. So now I ask this subreddit of experienced and diverse individuals: **what are the next steps I should take**?

As a side note, I have an idea for an EDA project, but haven't jumped into it yet because I'm not sure if jumping into the ""deep end"" and figuring out how to swim might be the best way to go about.

(FYI I know how to program - variables, loops, etc. - and I know Probability, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Neural Networks/ML all to different levels. Basically I'm not a beginner but I'm not an intermediate either).

Appreciate any guidance whatsoever!"

321,datascience,Is there a way to set a permanent resource allocation and priority for cuda applications?,"I have absolutely 0 idea how allocation works in nvidia graphics cards when working with ml models and things like TensorRT. I do have a fully functioning app now though that does dxgi screen dup and that pipes to a yolo implementation where I run inference.

However, if there is graphic rendering taking place on the same card, the detection times are drastically slower. This is probably to be expected to some extent, but it's not like the card is running at 100% when doing inference, and likewise while playing the game. It's a 3090ti so it's got some horsepower.

Can I protect and prioritize this inference over all other functions?

Worst case is, I have a couple other cards I can put in the box and give the model a dedicated resource. Ideally I wouldn't have to do that though.

My main question is, is there a difference between having it be a binary classification problem then taking the true labels, and putting that into a multi label classification problem.

Intuitively I‚Äôm thinking there would be no real difference, because the class weights for true/false would still overall be the same. But if we go with the first method it would be easier to see how the model is performing at different points.

326,datascience,Calculating required sample size for skewed distribution of known size,"I‚Äôm working on calculating the correct sample size we would need to correctly determine if one data sample is representative of a population of known size.  The goal of this test is to get a representative sample from a group of transactions that our live ML models are currently canceling, and therefore we have no signal into their outcomes.  I was wondering if there is anything non-obvious I should consider when estimating such a sample size.  For more detail:

- specifically, Im working on evaluating a machine learning model, where we cancel high risk transactions, and therefore don‚Äôt get any risk feedback/outcomes from that part of the overall risk distribution.  This means follow-up models are trained and evaluated on inherently biased data

- in order to evaluate our predictions better, we would like to randomly not cancel some proportion of that high risk group, so that we can measure that part of the risk distribution and synthetically generate training/test data from that sample in order to correct for this ‚Äúblind-spot‚Äù

- the distribution is heavily left skewed, with most transactions being low risk, and we have a known ‚Äúpopulation‚Äù of the distribution we are trying to measure.

- we want to select a sample size that will allows us to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù the null hypothesis.  This is a little backwards, since we want to show that the sun sample of the distribution has the same mean as the parent distribution (within some margin of error) 

What I want to know:  

- given the nature of the above problem, is there anything unique I should consider when calculating sample size, other than the desired confidence level, desired margin or error, and parent population size?

- has anyone done a similar experiment in the past?

331,datascience,R Tidyverse / dplyr is life changing!,"I am a Data Analyst who has been using R for 3 years and SQL many more. I have always connected R Studio with the SQL Data Warehouse and more important I have always taught that the data cleaning should be made per SQL and then the analysis with R. My reasoning was that SQL is a common language for many outside of Data Analytics, therefore is easy to review the raw data (cleaned) even with other people. I was even extreme in my reasoing and trying to query stuff per SQL within R (library sqldf). 

But as you all know, you can not prepare everything per SQL. Very often one maybe forget to add feature or to make some other aggregation. Or maybe quickly add something to your R markdown or make some quick exploration. 

Many times I saw in stackoverflow or here in other subreddits mentioned the Tidyverse / dplyr package. I was always resistant to change because I firmly believed that data preparation and aggregation should be made before (if not 100% then maybe 80%).

Well now I completely changed my mind! I have just started learning the basic grammar of the tidyverse... OMG this is really life changing. 2-3 clicks and you make multiple data aggregation, filtered how you want and with feature engineering. 

Oh shit XYZ Tables are not in SQL. I have this other Data Frame that must be joined.... and with native R is such a pain in the ass... Oh wait, there it is. The Tidyverse!!

I plan to do a hypothesis test or T-test with each column, which will take a long time for sure. I've also thought about doing that thing where you multiply pairs of columns, but it seems like a sunk-cost fallacy at this point.

I've everything from logistic regression, to random foresting, to Naive Bayes, to gradient boosting. 

I was wondering how common these types of ""dead-ends"" are in data science, and if this is a feeling I should stoically start getting used to in the industry, as discouraging as it is  (im an intern, so i'm feeling pressured to show good results in this project). Likewise, I was wondering at what point do you deem a specific set of data to be a lost cause, and move onto trying to find new data? Or eventually call it a day and admit in analysis that there's no found correlation for a target variable with the given data?"

353,datascience,"First job at a big, slow, messy company. Should I bolt?","Hi everyone, I'm a *very* junior Junior Data Scientist - I started just four months ago after a Bachelor in Physics. 

Now, my company is a financial one, and my team is composed by some analysts and other three data scientists, but two of them are, in their words, ""bad at their job"" and I got hired because they ""needed help"". To be fair, even I am spotting some bad/messy practices. Furthermore, the tech stack is, eh. What it is, or better, what it isn't. 

I recently proposed to my team to try to learn together better practices and technologies, and they all accepted somewhat enthusiastically, but they have been here for 4 years and things are still like that, so I'm not very confident I'll be able to pull them. Members of my company's data science-centric team said (a bit snarkingly) that those two members of my team just don't know how to google things and figure stuff out. 

As the work seems to be very slow, I am learning on my own, but I am obviously progressing slower than if I had a mentor. Despite this, I feel a bit overwhelmed, as I feel they needed a Senior instead of a Junior.

My initial plan was to stay here for 1-2 years for the experience, and then search for a better place when I have a better skillset, but now I'm starting to fear I'm shooting my career in the foot.

What if I don't manage to learn enough to 1) master the craft and 2) get a better* position? Is that even a possibility? I don't want to spend two years as a Junior here and then two other years as a Junior somewhere else. 


*with a better pay - as my country's starting salary for data scientist is a joke - and with a well defined workflow and tech stack.

But lately, I've been doing a lot of stupid things, and it's like my manager doesn't value my opinion, and continues to make really stupid decisions and agreements with other teams that honestly make no sense at all. For example, we often send email blasts out to our target audience with a program. It's B2B customer awareness, and I help to get the data on the customers, determine who it needs to go to. But we noticed that a lot of customers don't seem to get the communications. 


So it was decided We will send out several thousand emails with read receipts enabled, and track them in the worst way. Just copying the emails from Outlook into Excel, and then using VLOOKUPs and cross referencing the email addresses against a contact list with mappings. If their email is present in the list of read receipts we got back, then they read the email. But there are just a few problems. Organizations can disable read receipts, certain applications can fail to send them, users can choose in their outlook or Google settings to never send read receipts. Read receipts can simply fail to be delivered because you're sending from internal to external, and otherwise.

2) While interpreting ACF and PACF graphs only lines that exceed significance line is taken into consideration.

3) To find **order of the AR model** count how many lines exceed significance line in **PACF graph.**

4) To **find order of MA model** count how many lines **exceed significance line in ACF graph.**

5) If the plot shows spike at **0** ignore that spike as that spike is due to correlation with its own value.

Second question, how do we actually implement the machine learning algorithm after training and testing it, how do we actually make it work in a real life scenario to predict the outcome?

382,datascience,Today I was interviewing Data Scientists.. heres some thoughts," 

Hi All,

So  today was another day of interviewing data scientists. Today it was  juniors (grads) and journeymen - people who have got 2-3 years under  their belt.

I thought I would give some background thoughts and comments - if you are reading this you may well be interested in it.

Context first.

I  lead a fairly big data group with platform engineers, data engineers  and MI/BI team, an analyitics team and a Data Science team. And I will  say that I'm personally fairly strong in the space with a lot of real  world experience rather than a nonsense manager talking rubbish from  above.

Really importantly - I  don't work for a data company or a tech company. I work for a private  company in the UK who makes money by doing other things. 99.95% of the  staff do not care about data - it's a pain in the backside... they just  want to do business and make money. So... at least some of what I say  here does not apply for the pure tech space - maybe.

Today  I had down selected 34 CV's to 8 interviews and will take two people  forwards. Thats.... OK. Don't worry about the other people if you are  interviewing though - just be better than them.

Lastly  for context - I pay pretty well - top half of the salary band for the  north of england, so this is not about ""scraping the bottom of the  barrel""

The Basics

\--  Wash. Brush your hair. Wear a shirt or a blouse. Smile. Talk about  something when we meet - ""how was your weekend""... I'm a human. Breathe.

When  you get the job, unless you work at a fancy bank then no one cares what  you look like - but it's about playing the game. And the game is ""I  know the rules of an interview"". A ¬£10 shirt will get you more points  than a ¬£100 tshirt.

\-- Women - you are (slightly) already winning

A  lot is made of women in Data Science. And thats great, it's a great  career. But the reality is that both myself and pretty much all the  people in my position automatically assume that a woman is slightly  better than an equivilant guy and certainly slightly more pragmatic.  Don't worry about the gender thing - you are already very slightly  ahead... we WANT the pragmatic and the sensible. Rockstars are a pain in  the backside.

The three best  hires of my life were all female data scienstists. 5 of the top 10 data  scientists in the UK and maybe the world at the moment are female. Just  be you.

The Tougher Stuff.

\-- Guys.... you have to know your maths

Data  Science is about ""Getting Sh\*\* done"" - it's NOT ENOUGH to know a few  algorithms and a bit of python and want in on a job. Being REALLY  brutal.... I can pick up a regular python developer with 3 years dev  experience and have them learn some algorithms and they would be more  productive than someone who's in the ""pet algorithm camp"".

You  NEED to know your maths. Stats especially - you need REALLY good stats.  And when I say that I do not at all mean \*advanced\* stats... I mean  ""rock solid general stats"". All the basic stuff that gets glossed over.  Why are we using a normal distribution when this is an Alpha skew? Why  are you using a linear regression for a dynamic system?  I need you to  know a harmonic mean and when to use it. I really need you to be aware  of things like a birthday paradox becuase every manager that you ever  help out will NOT know it. Fundementals will ALWAYS beat a nice  algorithm.

Biases

Somewhere  between 1/4 and 1/5 of the work you get asked to do will be flat out  stupid. Mostly because of biases and nonsense thinking. Wikipedia's  ""list of biases"" page is amazing. It will save you more time, get you  more promotions and save your employer more time than you will EVER  achieve with a tweak to a codebase. Go devour it, and then TELL ME WHEN  I'M BEING DUMB.

""Here is a nice answer"" gets you good points in an interview

""Here is a nice answer... but you need to be careful about X"" gives you huge points in an answer

Be Fanatical about money

Heres  the thing. YOU want a career in data science. Great.... me too. But we  are in the extreme minority. The companies paying your salary are  interested in results. And those need to be hefty. If you are working  for ¬£50k and your company is working on a 25% margin, they need ¬£200,000  of value out of you just to break even.

So...  your work is not about the work itself. It's about the OUTCOMES of the  work. Make sure when you get asked the interview questions that you are  ALWAYS thinking ""whats the end result here?"" and answer that... not just  the specific question

""The best algorithm to use in &lt;this case&gt; is X"" ... bad answer

""The best algorithm to use in &lt;this case&gt; is X because of A, B C"" - good answer

""The  best algorithm to use in &lt;this case&gt; is X, but it takes a lot of  effort, so if we are just exploring a problem I'd probably have a quick  check with Y first as it's a 1/2 hour job and will show us the value  quickly as a test"" .... amazing answer - consider yourself recuited.

If  you are taking online courses like datacamp etc... brilliant. I love to  see this. But take the extra 10 hours to do a ""introduction to business  basics"" instead or as well - you will leapfrog your peers.

Be Pragmatic

Unless  you're working for a tech outfit where data science is their bread and  butter, then the task is Getting Stuff Done. FIND YOUR STAKEHOLDER SOME  VALUE.

be ready to talk about  prototypes. Failing fast. Iteration. Be ready to say ""I don't know but  I'd be thinking about X, Y and Z"". How can you take a big problem and  break it down into a bunch of small quick tests to see if you are on the  right track?

Keep telling me that bad data is death.

The  killer of all data science, and the constant frustation of your end  users is that bad data wrecks models. I know this... I do this for a  living. I \*hope\* you know this. I really \*want\* you to know this, but  you need to tell me. More than once.

""How would you do X?"" - ""I'd do a PCA and then a quick d/tree to get a view of it"" .... meh... ok

""How  would you do X?"" - I'd do a PCA and see if the results seem logical -  if they don't then I'd go ask someone to have a look otherwise i'm  wasting my time - then I'd do a quick d/tree"" - amazing. AMAZING.  Consider yourself the reciepient of a new office pass.

""I Don't Know But......"" gets you almost as many, or sometimes even more points than ""I know this""

Remember  that unless you are going for the ¬£100k+ roles you are not assumed to  know everything. What worries a hiring manager - a LOT - is someone who  can't see their gaps. You are the guys that cause us chaos.

Not knowing the answer in an interview is OK IF you pull it back.

""What's your experience with SVM Classifiers?"" - ""nothing - sorry""  .... ok.. maybe you lose some points

""Whats  your experience with SVM Classifers?"" - ""I've heard they are hard and a  bit twitchy. If I needed to learn them I'd spend a couple of evenings  before hand playing at home with the Iris dataset and SciKit to get a  feel for them - so at the moment my experience is low but I think I'd be  useful with them in the space of a few days"" - boom - amazing.

Data prep, data prep, data prep

You  will spend WAY more of your time doing data prep than actual coding and  data science work. A Data Science job is, really, cursing at messy  data, fixing messy data and then doing a bit of other stuff along the  edges.

Show me you can do it. Show  me that you can fix up some data in a data frame. Show me you know why a  one hot is important. Show me that you have the basics of SQL.

And if I don't bring it up in the interview - force it into the conversation with me.

Lastly...

Ask  me questions. It doesn't matter what - you can literally make them up  on the spot or have a handful of questions you use for lots of  interviews.. but ask me questions - plural. Partly it's something I'm  looking for as part of the interview itself. But partly - it makes you  more human. It makes you seem engaged and excited. Ask me HARD  questions.... ""Whats the biggest problem you guys have had in the last  year?"" ""Whats the biggest challenge I'll find when I join?"" ""What do you  wish was different about your data group?""

This was a lot of words....  if anyone has any specific questions then post them and I'll try and respond"

What I am looking for is guidance as to what logic I should follow in when I am dealing with such tables. Is there a website or a blog that could help me understand this logic?

388,datascience,What is the appeal of dplyr in R?,"I see so many posts say that that dplyr package in R is amazing, but... for some reason, I just don't get the appeal. I prefer traditional logical indexing over filter and select. I prefer writing out steps over a few lines of code instead of piping. What makes tibbles so much better than regular data frames? Every time I convince myself to try dplyr again, I run into some step where tibbles get clunky and doesn't do what a regular data frame does. Now, there have been a few cases I used tibbles to do something I couldn't otherwise (stuff with group\_by), but by and large, I don't see the appeal.

So, what am I missing? Is it just preference, or am I really missing out? Is anyone else out there like me, or am I the only one? I do use ggplot2 a lot, so I can appreciate Tidyverse's other contributions.

395,datascience,How best can I determine the target rate for a KPI metric?,"I am working on a project where I evaluate the  Key Performance Index (KPI) for a solar company. The aim to see how the company is performing generally and see if it is efficient. Some of the metrics that I look at are:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How many solar installation appointments were made weekly?

2. How may dispatch were made based on the appointments?

3. How many appointments were carried over in the week?

4. What is the completion rate for the solar installation?

5. What is the same day rate completion for the solar installation?

&amp;#x200B;

For each of these metrics, an arbitrary target rate was set to measure performance. For example, a target rate of 80% was set for item #1, 90% for item #2, 60% for item #3 etc...Anything below these percentages means poor performance for each of the metrics. Please not that these target rates were not based on data or science. I have now been tasked to come up with a target rate that is backed by data and statistics and not one from a manager just throwing out some numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

How best can I approach this please? How can I provide a better framework on targets setting? What is the cost benefits of setting these targets?

Three months ago I was promoted to Commercial Analyst for a local telecoms company (¬£130m revenue/ 500 employees). I work in the International Department (80 employees maybe?) where we resell use of our commercial agreements for use of network routes with other international telecoms companies, marketing companies, IoT, etc. I have been working with SQL Server, Power BI, doing data analysis using Python, as well as the inevitable Excel. I make ¬£31k p/a, rising to ¬£33.5k in another three months. I do live in an expensive area (think London prices) so this salary is inflated.

I have a good degree of autonomy and the people I work with are good people. I report to the Pricing and Financial Planning Manager, who I feel trusts me and asks for my input. They report to the Head of Commercial for International Department. There is a lot of historic sales data available in our data warehouse/ platforms. The main drawback is that there aren't any experienced analysts I'm working with who are using statistical methods or Python, so there isn't anyone to learn from in this regard. We do have a Data Analyst consultant who I have recently started working with and they have been really helpful teaching SQL Server. A Data Analyst, ""SQL expert"", will be replacing the consultant in three months.

My manager has recently asked how we can improve revenue/ traffic forecasting so I have been working on building and evaluating a time series model (SARIMA) for one of our products. This has been exploratory so far and I'll be presenting to management soon and discuss if/ where they see this adding value (beyond looking cool haha). For forecasting the total revenue/ traffic during a month, the model for this particular product is only a marginal improvement over a simple model of predicting the previous month's total revenue/ traffic. Where this model shines is a one-day to one-week forecast horizon, so hopefully there'll be some value for anomaly detection - we'll see. There's plenty of other interesting questions we can ask of our sales data, e.g. price optimisation with a regression model.

Anyway, onto the main point.. I've been accepted for an interview for a Junior Statistician position for a new local government project. The salary bracket is ¬£39-45k p/a.

*Develop and maintain minimum information data sets. Develop automated systems for data collection, extraction, collation and presentation where appropriate, including the creation of relevant documentation and test plans, in order that reporting meets the objectives, processes are efficient and high quality reporting is produced which informs and improves operational and strategic decision making.*

I notice that the projects I tend to work on involve me doing *all* the following:

* proof-of-concept of technical advances I think of in company products
* working highly cross-functional, projects typically involve involvement of three or more teams
* data collection methods and implementation in products (sourcing/building sensors, building prototypes, etc.)
* design and execution of pipelines for data flow
* experimental design (subject selection, test experiment conditions, use cases, statistical design, etc.)
* conducting the experiment
* ETL (extract transform &amp; load, usually python or SQL)
* exploratory ad-hoc analysis of experiment data (python, utilization of priors and statistical tests)
* post-hoc data analysis (using everything from linear regression to deep learning models)
* visualization of results in dashboards and notebooks (python, rarely tableau)
* presentation and communication with stakeholders and suppliers

431,datascience,Business degree with a second major in data science analytics (DSA),"Was wondering if anyone has a similar educational background as mine - i will be Y2 this coming august and i have decided i would like to take a second major in DSA. Ironically though, i am unsure of which first major i want/domain i wish to specialize in.

(1) So far, im thinking of either finance or operations management, but would be happy to hear about stories from other majors like marketing. 


As for why i would like to major in DSA, i am currently in a repe internship and i realised how important data is in this field (finding comparables, and making sure that you are not overpaying especially with the recent cap rate compression). Even if i do not become a data analyst/scientist, i do think it would help me greatly if i had knowledge in this field.


(2) Would be interested in knowing more about what skills to pick up for data science that is not 3months or something (I've got 3more years till graduation anyway). 

Currently, ive finished the google data analytics certificate, automate boring stuff with python, halfway through 365 careers the data science course 2022 and thinking of andrew ng's new course after that.

Thank you and have a good day!"

I have a excel worksheet with 3  sheets.
2 out of 3 sheets are actually dashboards and tables. 
1 sheet contains the raw data based on which the dashboard is updated. It also contains certain formulas.

I'm trying to use python to automate some of the manual tasks involved.
I want to pandas to update the data sheet by adding in new rows and doing a vlookup.

Once the data sheet has been updated is there a way I can export the worksheet as it is after the data sheet has been updated.  I want the remaining sheets containing the dashboard and the data sheet containing formulas to remain as unchanged.

451,datascience,How do I know if data science is actually my career path?,"I am a rising junior in college studying statistics and data science. I just recently got into my major after a lot of exploring so I haven't been exposed to much of my major yet. 

I've done a lot of research on paths to a data science career and I've seen a lot of people saying that grad school is highly recommended if you want a data scientist position. This is I am totally okay with. 

So, I've started the process of cold emails professors for research opportunities at my university, just to get some experience. During this process, I've realized that this some of this statistical research just doesn't seem too interesting to me and is just plain intimidating to look at. It doesn't seem like something that I would enjoy doing too much to be completely transparent.

Math and doing things with numbers has always been strong suit of mine and something I sort of enjoyed in high school. After seeing that data science revolves around computer science, math, and statistics, I decided not to overthink it and pursue this path as those three subjects are all strengths/interests of mine. Additionally, I love seeing things through an analytical mindset so it almost seemed like a no brainer.

The thing is, even after being exposed to just a little bit of the nitty gritty in this field, it seems  daunting. Being stuck in a career path that I dislike doing is a massive fear of mine. Is it dumb to follow this simplification of data science? Not really sure how else people decide their careers, but seems like it isn't too complicated.

They make you go through quite challenging technical interviews, they pay you relatively high salaries... but are you providing any value?

I am starting to feel like the whole Data concept is just a buzzword that delivers no real value, and this is frankly very discouraging. It looks like you don't build anything useful, and at the end of the day your contribution to the company is basically nothing. Unfortunately, I have a similar view about all the nuances of Data Analytics. Maybe I'd save Data Engineering, as they develop systems to store data that, yes, exists and, yes, needs to be consulted from time to time (but with nothing very complex behind it).

486,datascience,Normalizing a heterogeneous dataset,"Hi everyone!
Beginner here. I am trying to solve a binary classification task on a dataset of customer transactions, and not sure how to normalize/standardize the features. The issue is that the dataset has transactions from multiple customers, customers of varying sizes and transaction volumes, some customers sometimes have no transactions for days/weeks then have many another day, others are more stable in their activity (so hard to estimate stable customer means/standard deviations)
These transactions come from various customers at unevenly spaced times. The features I work with are mainly counts computed over sliding windows. 
What do you think is a way to approach standardizing/normalizing such a dataset? Is it alright to do so based on values from all customers or should it be done on individual customer level (normalize a feature only based on what we have seen thusfar for that customer vs. for all customers)? Beyond scaling the data, this can also help the model discern bigger customers from smaller ones etc. Am I approaching this correctly?"

In terms of what I actually do: I write simple functions to perform data checks and validation as well as some basic text parsing as well as some testing modules. I also maintain the notebooks/scripts written by our dev team for our daily data processing tasks. The only programming languages I really use are Python and SQL.  I have some experience writing web scrapers and automating basic tasks. I know the basics of Python (iteration, recursion, functions, methods, etc.) but haven't touched the heavy stuff like implementing search/sort algorithms.  I starting doing code challenges on [codewars.com](https://codewars.com) which has been fun but can only solve up to kyu 5. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR: As someone with some self-taught Python skills without a computer science background, can I just jump into a Data Science masters program?**

Apologies if this isn't the right place to ask this!"
503,datascience,Is there a function that behaves in between the weighted average and the weighted median?,"Hello everyone. I have a 2D scattered field of values which I'm working with. I want to predict values in a specific point, based on neighbouring values. I was considering two different approaches, a weighted average of the neighbours and a weighted median, where the weights are based on distances. Since the values can be affected by error, the weighted median is a more robust predictor when some of the neighbouring values are wrong, but if the values are correct, the weighted average is a better prediction.

I was wondering if there was any function that behaves a bit like both, and I came across the ""average-weighted median"" from this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-015-2110-8#:~:text=Average%2Dweighted%20median%20estimation) and described in [figure 5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00348-015-2110-8#:~:text=Weights%20in%20the%20awmed(%E2%88%99)%20operator%20depend%20on%20the%20distance%20between%20the%20investigated%20vector%20and%20its%20neighbours%20following%20Eq.%C2%A0(2)%20and%20are%20reflected%20in%20the%20bar%20widths) as well.

I've never heard of this *average-weighted median* before and I was wondering, is it a legitimate function used in statistics? Why have I never come across it before?"

1. High Saving Potential: I've seen quite a lot of posts that say that 100k+ in the Bay Area doesn't go as far as 80-90k in a MCOL area. I'm looking to save as much as possible and also pay off my student loans so a place that can let me do that without selling my soul to pay rent would be great. 

2. Diverse, Young Population: I'm 23 and single so somewhere with a rather diverse population where the dating scene (if that's the best way to phrase it) is decent would be preferred.

514,datascience,Is graduate school worth it? Currently data scientist at consulting firm,"**Background**

I studied engineering at a public university and graduated in 2019. I immediately went to a technology consulting firm thinking I would be more of a traditional consultant but joined an advanced analytics team.  I gained a lot of practical technical knowledge and learned much more about machine learning and software development on the job. I produced some production-level model deployments but most of the projects I worked on were proof of concepts for clients.  In late 2021, I took a similar position at a different global management consulting firm (mainly because of compensation). At this new job, I‚Äôve been learning programming best practices since the engineers on the team are generally better. My current company will sponsor my higher education if it is STEM/analytics related. I can make the petition for MBA if I pivot my designated career path. Tuition will be fully paid for but I would be required to return to the company for two years.  Because most of my experience has been in consulting firms, I sometimes don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a ""true data scientist"" but I‚Äôm definitely more technical than your typical data analyst. 

**Future Career Goals**

Overall, I think my next career move will be to go to big tech or AI start-up. While I enjoy technical work, I‚Äôm more suited to management/people-related work. Since I‚Äôm young (24F), I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good time to pivot now since I still want to develop technical expertise. 

**Options**

1. **Don‚Äôt go to Graduate Schoo**l. I currently make \~$150K a year. Going to graduate school has a large opportunity cost as I would be forgoing salary for 1-2 years. Making a lateral jump to another company would be doable and help me make more money but I like the idea of going to graduate school as a resume builder/potential long-term salary booster. I am also somewhat burned out and was thinking it could be a productive break for me.  
2. **Data Science Programs.** These programs are sponsored by my company for my career path. However, most of the options I‚Äôve seen are basically Python/R factories. They are geared toward people who didn‚Äôt study engineering or CS as an undergrad, looking to pivot into the data science industry. I don't think I would learn as much in these programs because I‚Äôm already applying the curriculum they teach to my actual job.  
3. **Computer Science Programs.** CS programs are also explicitly allowed by my company for tuition sponsorship. Some of these programs are more machine learning-based which would be of interest to me but I know it‚Äôs going to be a lot harder.  
4. **MBA.** MBA programs are not directly sponsored by my company for my career path. I would need to petition to get the sponsorship (which seems very doable). MBA may be useful for pivoting more into management long term.

My main questions are:

* Is it worth it for me to pursue a graduate degree, given my career goals? If yes, which programs make the most sense for balancing learning, career goals, and taking a break from actual work?

**TLDR;** Currently a data scientist at a global consulting firm. My company is offering to pay for a STEM-related graduate degree. Not sure if I should pursue a graduate degree because would be forgoing salary but could be useful for my future career."

519,datascience,PhD graduate deciding between lead data analyst and project manager position,"I am a recent neuroscience PhD graduate. I have experienced using R for complicated statical analysis and neuroimaging tools. I also directed a large outreach program and gained project management skills with that and PhD projects. I worked in clinical labs for 5 years before PhD. 

I recently received an offer to be a lead data analyst for a large academic institution and the mental health area. I also have an offer from a smallish company that does clinical validation project management and AI tech in hospital patients that get MRIs. 

I'm likely to be offered the same pay of around 116k. I'm curious if this is good or low for either profession and if there's any reason to avoid the lead data analyst position, as I am leaning towards that. 

I'm thinking long-term. It would be easier to transition from lead data analyst to project manager if I wanted to go that route, but not necessarily the other way around as I'll probably forget a lot of the analysis skills if I don't continue them now. I'm also getting the vibe that the lead position is more of a leadership role and less BS from clients but I'm not sure.

Just curious on any insight you can offer as this is my first post academia job."

    	x = layers.Activation('relu')(x)
    
    	return x

Below is dens\_block:

It seems extremely inefficient to write all this Python code, then spend hours debugging it, when you could handle all of the data pre-processing, testing different types of models, and analyzing the results using a tool like Dataiku. 

Also, I see it quite often when someone in my organization spends a significant amount of time building an advanced machine learning model and they completely miss the big picture. Quite often the simplest model is the best model. If a low code tool can help me figure that out without going through hours of building an advanced model, then it's a huge win for me."

539,datascience,Application of Regression Discontinuity,"I hope this is an appropriate place to discuss application questions. If not, I can remove this.

I have a scenario where I am monitoring if a revamped process results in an improvement in some performance metric. However, I have no ability to create a randomized experiment for implementing the revamped process due to time constraints. 

Say this revamped process is implemented at time T and this revamped process is applied to all units (again, no randomized experiment possible), and we monitor the performance metric from some time in the past T-t1 to some time in the future T+t2. My initial thought is to use regression discontinuity to see if there is a significant jump at time T. 

My questions are...

1. Is this a valid approach for cases when a randomized experiment is not feasible? My initial research leads me to think yes, but I want to be aware of any possible ""gotchas"" that I may be missing.
2. If 1 is yes, is there a specific amount of measurements into the futurethat I have to satisfy to achieve statistically significant results? Basically, my question is what should the value of t2 be... should I be waiting 1 months after the process revamp to perform the Regression Discontinuity test, or 2 months/3 months/etc?"

So the story goes like this: when my teacher was still a student (early 2000s/late 90s), he was doing his end of studies project, and he needed 5 years worth of banking detail data, he toured many bank agencies asking for it, and of course all of them refused to give their data because it's confidential.

However surprisingly, he came across one agency where a young employee gave him the 5 years of data he was looking for, the young employee was proficient in data science/data analysis, the teacher was overjoyed and felt lucky to finally find what he was seeking cause the senior employees at the same bank wouldn't have given him the data like the young employee did.

Now there's a catch, even though the data given to him was real and useful, the teacher didn't tell us what kind of data exactly it was...

The question is, what kind of data was it? and why did the young employee give it to him with no hesitation and without regard to confidentiality(?)"

At work, we have a Senior Data Scientist who set up the release of a model to production with our stakeholders.
The model is a classifier that  automates decisions on tasks for simpler work items in a financial services risk classification context.
Despite me recommending he consider running the model live for a week or 2 before releasing it live to stakeholders (who were going to be using the model for decisions that could ultimately result in &gt; 1million dollar payouts if wrong), he said ‚Äòno that‚Äôs the accuracy‚Äô when referring to the trained model results, that were 92%-98%+.

Then, he released the model, went on annual leave, and left us there with it having results in the 70‚Äôs and not for intended purpose.

When I suggested he may have overfit the model - he got extremely angry and suggested that ‚Äòhe has plenty of uni professors he can get advice from and doesn‚Äôt need advice from me‚Äô. 

When I asked him what the cross-validated performance results were, he said there is no cross validation, and that it goes ‚Äòtraining‚Äô &gt; predicting decisions for most recent 3 month‚Äôs worth of data.

Not even a test/validation split for the training portion, before predicting the recent 3 months, for the reported training results that he had set expectation we would achieve (to hundreds of people).

Am I right in thinking this is likely to be severe overfitting? Or is it more likely model leakage etc?

Problem setup is 300 or so features, probably 50 used, and XGBoost / Random Forest.

According to Glassdoor I'm paid alright as is, according to recruiters I talk to and my DS peeps in PE I could be getting much, much more. I really enjoy my current job and I'm not in a huge rush to exit, but it is something I feel I need to think about and make happen within the next few years.

If I'm to give a brutally honest assessment, I have some great strengths in 1) industry knowledge 2) I'm a whiz with data munging 3) visualization 4) story telling 5) programming in R. But there are some weak points in my skill set and resume. The biggest issue I have is probably that I'm sort of pigeonholed in R and have minimal experience in python and other languages. The other is that without explaining my degree, my educational background is on the weaker side. I have an non-terminal MS from a PhD program in political science from a department that is notoriously the most quantitative in the country. So while it was an extremely rigorous program and probably closer to a traditional Econ program than Poli-Sci when it comes to math people likely aren't aware of that. More concerning, while I love my current job it is mostly data munging and descriptive statistics. I've barely exercised my statistics and ML training over the past five years and feel it's sort of fallen to the wayside. 

I'm considering taking on an online MS-DS course from CU Boulder. My line of thinking is that it will force me to refresh my core data science skillset and force me to learn some other languages while also providing a more serious education line on my resume. One nice thing with this course is it won't require me to re-take the GRE, get together references, etc as entry is based on performance in three preliminary courses. And 20k seems to be on the cheaper side for this sort of program as well.

Do you guys think this is worth it or would I be wasting my time and money?

599,datascience,Help me settle an argument with my friend over a logistic regression implementation.,"Hi everyone,

I am a data analyst with a MSc in Data Science and my friend is currently following a bootcamp where he is learning Data Science/Analytics. 
He had a first project to submit and chose to make a simple logistic regression model predicting the winner of a tennis match.

In order to predict the winner, he used a limited amount of variables such as *Number of aces, % of first serve, % of returns, height, left-handed/right-handed*. In the training and test sets, he used the data of the match itself to predict the winner of the match, for instance if player 1 made 10 aces in the match, he would input 10 aces in the variable Number of aces for that match.

To use his model in new circumstances, he knows he doesn't have access to the data of the match itself so he used the average of the last 20 matches for each player. So, if player 1 had an average of 8 aces over the last 20 matches, he would input 8 aces in the variable Number of aces, etc.

In my opinion, this is wrong. This is for me a typical case of data leakage, he is using data not available at the time of the prediction to train his model and tries to correct for it at runtime by using arbitrarily the average over x games as an input.

I told him that the coefficients of the logistic regression were fitted with variables that had a specific distribution and that distribution is altered when he's using the mean of the variables as input for his model. Therefore, the betas of the log reg are not fitted correctly and his model is not optimal.

He's arguing that because the average will approximate good values for each player that the coeffs are in fact correctly adjusted.

To which I am saying that the function *average* that he's using over the last 20 matches is in fact another kind of predictive model he's applying to his independent variables and that he has no way of estimating the correctness of the predictions he's applying to these variables.

I would appreciate it if someone could chime in on this debate by saying who's right and why? With an explanation as little dogmatic as possible please.

Thanks in advance."

1. Can my flaws be addressed by experience and practice? If no, then I suppose I need more theory‚Ä¶would there be any obvious recommendations?
2. Are there any other technical skills I should learn outside of SQL and accessing APIs for jsons? I am not familiar with image processing and web scraping.
3. How do you approach datasets? Do you just practice datasets, no matter how ubiquitous they are (e.g. titanic, iris) or how little they tell you (e.g. literally obvious predictions)? Or with no job experience, do I only want to look at datasets that look like they have business impact?
4. Are there any websites for Datasets outside of Kaggle I can draw for inspiration that might incorporate SQL, Pandas?
5. Are there any websites, blogs, or videos that have code-alongs for real, unprocessed data (e.g. not cleaned) where they can kinda explain their EDA, cleaning, feature engineering, insights, etc? I want to know what a real life data scientist does, not just mess with perfect data."
605,datascience,What does it mean,"Hiring manage told that he is working on my offer and I will be hearing from HR soon. I was expecting an offer. But,  HR called me and asked about my salary expectation. I told my expected salary and also mentioned that I‚Äôm open for negotiation. He also mentioned that there are few other final candidates and based on everyone‚Äôs salary expectations they will choose the final candidate. He told he will call me in few days. Should I email hiring manager or wait for HR call? I would appreciate any advice."
606,datascience,Title downgrade for more money - would you?,"My progression so far has already experienced one downgrade, not sure if I can tolerate another? 

2017-2021: 4 years as Data Scientist at non-tech company
2021-2022: 1 year as  Senior Data Analyst at non FAANG tech company (x3 pay - going from severely underpaid tho so not an amazing jump)
Current: Now offered Data Analyst position at FAANG - x2 current pay but my title progression is literally going backwards at this point. It's depressing to think about, but then this new offer is good money (to me) and in a low tax environment.

FAANG would look good on my CV but not sure if I'm really setting myself up for regret. I'll be 30 next year, with a Masters (no PhD). Thoughts?"
607,datascience,Credit Risk Scoring (Default During Observation Window),"My team is working with an adjacent team that is developing a credit risk scoring model.

They've defined the observation window as 12 months and their performance window as the proceeding 12 months.

In situations where the customer's loan defaults within the observation window, they are dropping those customers.  Their reasoning is that these customers do not make for good training data because the training data window is less than 12 months (we are limited to a rolling 24 month overall data window).

To me, this seems like a case of survivorship bias, and this will generate an overly-optimistic model in some scenarios.

My question is, is what this team doing good practice or industry standard? I've had difficulty finding information online about this scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: Team is not including data on customers who defaulting within observation window (as opposed to having defaulted in performance window) due to containing less than 12 months of training data."

634,datascience,Alternative to google sheets for large datasets?,"Hi,

Not sure if this is the place to ask but here goes. I am currently working as a data anayst in the digital marketing space. We are working on a project where we need to decode a text string to obtain specific information (campaign name, keyword, etc). My company uses google sheets for pretty much everything. So as an input we get the date, text string and conversion count on that string, and we extract all the necessary information using regular expressions and formulas. This data is then used for creating pivot tables and google sheet queries using dropdowns (i.e. looking at the data between specific date ranges, data at the campaign level, data at keyword level etc).

The main issue is that we receive almost 10k rows per week. Google sheets isn't suited for large datasets and we face lagging issues all the time. We were thinking about moving to powerBI for this task but I'm not sure whether it supports queries w.r.t. date ranges (like in Google Sheets). Same problem with excel. 

Is there a suitable alternative to google sheets where I can do the above task? I essentially want to query the data based on date ranges and a few other dropdowns but am not getting any ideas. Any help is appreciated!"

The same logic applies to the topic of Data Analyst vs. Data Scientist. The prefix of ‚ÄòData‚Äô in both the designations conveys a sense of similarity in terms of the fact that both individuals happen to deal with Data."

647,datascience,How would you handle this situation?,"**Situation:**

Last year I started working as a data scientist for a non-FAANG tech company. Prior to that I was working as an academic researcher in the domain that our company operates.

Our company has two main offerings: a core data product which is licensed to users/businesses, and consultancy services for businesses wanting to make use of our data. I am working in the consultancy side of the business, which also has teams for sales, marketing, etc. \~90% of client projects involve development of custom analyses and dashboards built on top of our own data product, which my data team are responsible for building.

Our data team is pretty small (5 full-time employees). Our team manager is an experienced project manager but his experience is aligned mainly with the domain we are working in and not in data science itself (i.e. he doesn't code). 

**Problem:**

Historically, each new project has been assigned to a single person in the team, who then carries out the project entirely individually with their own preferred tools and project structure. Whilst we have a few standards in the team (e.g. we strictly only code in Python), generally speaking it is a free-for-all when it comes to project implementation. Until now this seems to have worked, but it does cause some friction when projects need to be taken over (e.g. if another team member is away, or has other priorities). There is also no real onboarding in the team, it is simply, ""welcome, now start building...""

We are expecting the team to grow significantly in the next year, and going forward this way of working is not sustainable. From my perspective, we need to enforce more standards in the team in terms of project lifecycles, standardized project structures, monitoring of resource usage, and significantly improved documentation of tools and utilities. However, I'm not sure how to approach this - partly because I am the new person in the team, and partly because I have no comparable experience with other data teams to understand how these standards are enforced. Should this be something everyone on the team discusses and buys into, or do most data teams have a person whose role it is to manage and control these issues? Or is our team simply too small to worry about these issues for now? Any advice appreciated!"

I‚Äôm relatively new to my role as a Data Scientist and am looking for a way to ‚Äúlevel up‚Äù and feel more confident in my skills. 

I got here through self-teaching skills, so while I was able to achieve this position I‚Äôm very aware that my peers are much more advanced and I‚Äôll have difficulty moving elsewhere unless I level up. 

My Bachelor‚Äôs degree is not in CS or anything DS related. It‚Äôs in business (Marketing), so I lack a solid foundation. 

I‚Äôm interested in a Masters degree but put off by the amount of time and feeling like it‚Äôs more theoretical rather than directly applicable. Also I lack that CS foundation so I‚Äôm not convinced that a Masters will make that any better because it‚Äôs more advanced topics related to CS rather than the foundations of CS. I feel a little pressured to take this path since I‚Äôm very aware how difficult it can be to get a role in DS without a Masters in CS/Math/DS. 

Alternatively, I know that AWS or Azure experience is very desirable, so I‚Äôve been looking into taking a Solutions Architect (AWS) or Azure Data Science program since I really want to learn these technologies and enjoy that more than math theory. 

I‚Äôm just kind of overwhelmed by all the paths I could take to advance my career and am curious what your feedback is? Also if you recommend any other paths or programs not mentioned in this post? Do you think I need to invest the time into a Masters because even if I level up and get direct experience with AWS/Azure I‚Äôll have a hard time with not getting filtered out during screening due to lack of Masters?

As you already know, the first number inside the Conv2D class refers to the number of filter layers inside each class.

The way I see it is, initially you want only a few filters, to learn the 'big picture' features, and as you go deeper, you increase the number of filters to learn more features. So by the time you get to the last 5x5 layer, those 256 filters will learn in more detail. 

The other argument is that, initially you want many filters to learn as many 'big picture' features as possible. Later layers don't need 256 filters since the matrices sizes are smaller. They also need to be smaller so the information can be squished easier into the final Dense layer.

664,datascience,Question about utilizing Azure ML resources,"Hello.

We have a model tuning script that we need to run on a GPU-enabled instance, and currently the only way we'll be able to use one would be on the Azure cloud environment. I've been pooling information about the most efficient way this solution could be implemented, but I'm falling short on defining clearly what is possible on the Azure environment, and what would be the better way to do it.

I thought about:

- running a local script that creates a Azure VM instance through the SDK, loads the script, executes it and sends the result back to the local script. This would be the cheapest option, I think, since the VM would only run when needed, and the code could be in any format we want, since the output would be sent to our computer and would not be stored in Azure ML.
- using Azure ML Python Script. This seems way simpler, but I couldn't find much info about how to get any output we want from there (documentation talks about the default Azure two DataFrame output), and how to set up which compute instance to use for it.  

Using Azure's built in hyperparameter tuning is not an option, since we have our own custom process that wouldn't be able to replicated by Azure's tuning SDK.

Anyone who has worked with Azure can tell me about possible solutions for this? Thanks."

685,datascience,Is it still accurate to average time taken to complete a test with the plotted average y axis data points?,"Running MATLAB to use several different human subject tests who are wearing accelerometers. Their gait is what we are tracking and so I wanted to average all of their x, y, z accelerations. Problem is these tests can take different amount of times but a person should be consistent. For example it takes me on average 20 seconds to complete the test. I feel like I've never seen anyone in all my years of electrical engineering studies have an x axis labeled 'average time' rather than just time. I just want to see if this is like scientifically dishonest or breaks reality too much

Obviously every time we make emperiological statements they are a reduction of reality in some way. Literally bringing things into quantity alone most often. And further emperiological methods further this down. So I want to be aware of that and ask if you guys think it would be a problem. 

If we don't do average times then averaging the data visibly doesn't seem right. The outliers are not always the data point themselves but the total time it took to complete the test. If these flukes or outliers were also accounted for in time rather than display all the data as if each test did take 30 seconds I feel I am sort of making more real plots.

Systems Programming unit description: 

&gt; Understanding the relationship between a programming language and the contemporary operating systems on which it executes is central to developing many skills in Computer Science. This unit introduces the standard C programming language, on which many other programming languages and systems are based, through a study of core operating system services including input and output, memory management and file systems. The C language is introduced through discussions on basic topics like data types, variables, expressions, control structures, scoping rules, functions and parameter passing. More advanced topics like C's run-time environment, system calls, dynamic memory allocation, pointers and recursion are presented in the context of operating system services related to process execution, memory management and file systems. The importance of process scheduling, memory management and interprocess communication in modern operating systems is discussed in the context of operating system support for multiprogramming. Laboratory and practical class work place a strong focus on the practical application of fundamental programming concepts, with examples designed to compare and contrast many key features of contemporary operating systems."

716,datascience,Anomaly Detection in Time-Series,"Hi everyone,

I have distinct univariate time series data collected from the IoT products' sensors. Suppose that we have n products and p distinct univariate time-series. I need to develop an anomaly detection model to check everything is all right.

The dataset is hourly. It has expected boundaries due to physical limits. Suppose the sensors measure temperature. 

Initially, as a start point, I start with univariate modeling. Considering the nature of the dataset, I plan to combine the DBSCAN algorithm with a set of deterministic rules. Is this cause any problem? DBSCAN seems a good choice because it is density based and you do not have to pre-specify the number of clusters? Does it make sense?

Second, how can I leverage n products for a given time series? 

Finally, do you have any advice on this issue? Should I start with a simpler model like Z-Score? 

Thank you very much."

726,datascience,"Challenges with external data, how do you experience it?","Hi all,

At my company (I work at a small consulting firm), Data Scientists are seen as full-stack, so we're responsible for the full process: from getting data to deploying the ML model.

For some of our customers, we're looking to see whether we can integrate with external data providers (oftentimes using APIs to get the data) to improve our ML models. Some of those APIs are easier to work with than others ;).

We don't always know what kind of external data may be relevant. It either comes from a domain expert telling us what may be relevant, or we look at the data provided by those specific data providers. 

It's hard to sell/justify the time to invest in researching, integrating, and analyzing external data since we're not certain it could improve our ML model. Some customers are easier than others, but we do see a transition in the demand for external data.

With the demand for external data getting bigger, I see myself spending a lot more time on researching and integrating APIs, which I don't mind doing, but I'd rather spend my time on performing analyses.

How do you experience it? And what is the role of a Data Scientist at your company?"
727,datascience,Transitioning from a PhD in material science to data science,"Dear r/datascience,

I would like your advice.

I am a few days away from defending my PhD in material science (surface chemistry, thin films, etc.), it has been a rewarding experience (20+ publications) however for a variety of reasons I do not think continuing academic life is best for me. Instead I have been looking at material science industry jobs, however I have noticed quite a few are seeking a combination of materials and data science expertise. Hence, a part of me has been weighing up the option of going back and obtaining a formal qualifications in data science. 

I understand the likely trajectory here is to obtain a masters qualification, however I was wondering if others have managed to migrate into the data science field with similar qualifications (i.e. through upskilling)? I majored in mathematical modelling and have always loved programming + solving complex problems, so I am hopeful that will aid in my endeavor. 

What do you guys think? Is it conceivable to transition without 2 more years of (unpaid) study? 

Happy to give more details, I am still in the very early phase of considering but your help would be invaluable!

Thanks for reading!"
728,datascience,Switching from Astrophysics to Data Science?,"My background is a PhD in astrophysics, and I'm currently doing my first post-doc. I love what I do, but given the job market in my particular field is not that great, opportunities are rare and highly competitive, and one needs to be willing to relocate a lot in search of short-term contracts, at this point, I am pretty sure I'd like to leave academia and research. However, I'd still like to maintain an open door to possibly working in the space sector in the future (for example archive scientist and managing databases, scientific data handling, data processing). 

I am nervous about the switch and I don't know where to go from here. My degree was in observational astrophysics, that is I used a radiotelescope to collect large amounts of data and analyse that using specific tools developed for astronomy, and then make sense of the result (qualitatively and quantitatively).  I didn't spend much time coding during my degree, however, I did basic programming in python (NumPy, pandas, visualizing data). But I didn't use heavy computational techniques that would allow me to gain skills in data science, programming, machine learning, and big data. I also didn't do enough stats and probability to go into analytics either. 

I'm a little at loss about what to do with my career. My current contract ends in 1 year, and I am trying to take extra online courses that would prepare me to apply for jobs afterwards. But I'm not sure what to focus on or where to go from here. I'm leaning towards data analysis rather than data science because I'm assuming it doesn't require advanced programming?

The Ideal workflow would be -   
1. Engineering team generates the CSV and share the CSV with all the members of the data-science team.  
2. The CSV is available to everyone in the team to consume and is version controlled.  
3. The Analysts run some data cleansing algorithms and publish the final dataset  
4. The team then can run the SQL queries against the CSV directly on the browser or desktop app.  
5. They can also save the query and share the aggregated views to business stakeholders.

As far as I know, there is not one single app that does it all, is there a better workflow? wanted to know from the community.

I recently started working as a dashboard analyst in the finance industry, and the boss of my organisation is looking for certain stats around lending for a media release. The media in my country has been a buzz about this topic due to law changes and my boss wants to know how much of a change we've had in relation to it.

There has been a change, but it's not significant - most ways you'd spin it it would be less than 5%. They've given me the draft without stats and it's using words like ""significant"" so they aren't expecting to hear ""there has been a 2% change"". It is possible to manipulate the stats in a way so that it's more like a 10% change. I do not feel comfortable with that as it's feeding into the media frenzy about something that has no real substance.

To make it harder to say object to this, they've been saying this line of ""there has been an increase"" for a few months now. Someone else had looked into the data before me so I had assumed in good faith they had gotten the correct stats. Unfortunately, this is someone doesn't have any sort of stats/data background, and they are the type of person to tell the other organisations we work with that there has been ""a significant spike in xyz"". They would have gotten this ‚Äòinsight‚Äô from a line graph and when you look at the y axis the 'spike' goes from 1 to 2. This person went looking for the data they wanted, instead of exploring everything that was there to see if the would reach their expected results.

1. OMSA has several tracks.

I would graduate most quickly from this first track. The second is an analytical tools track, which is more math-heavy with statistical tools, and the final one has more opportunity to learn AI and ML(Computational Data Analytics Track). If I go for the business analytics track, I can continue to take classes if I would like to in AI and ML after my degree. I do find the idea of knowing AI and ML very interesting. Is completing the degree the fastest or taking longer to learn AI and ML before graduating a better career move? Does the track I pick matter?  Here is what I think I want in a job: 1. I like using patterns in data to solve meaningful problems. 2. A job where I can work remotely. 3. An eventual career earning &gt; $120,000/year, hopefully more.

772,datascience,Statistical Analysis on model inputs,"Hi. I¬¥m currently working on the pricing department of an insurance company and we have several models to calculate insurance premiums (these models are not solely based on statistics, but other actuarial techniques).
 
I have an idea of a project that consist of 2 parts:
 
1. I want to store in a database all the assumptions of the model, so each time we calculate a premium, all the assumptions are stored in this database. This will allow to have in one place, all the different components that are needed to calculate the premium.

2. Once I have the database with all the assumptions, I want to do some statistical analysis/inference with that data.

774,datascience,Every DS Needs Graph/Figure Modification Utilities!,"I know, I know, not every DS has to make decks or present to stakeholders. Some of you have the apocryphal DS role where you are building incredible models from scratch and publishing papers with cutting edge ML. For the rest of us, we have to present shit to stakeholders, PMs, and non technical people. I tend to code primarily in Python, and enjoy using Plotly to make figures to explore data. The figures I create often have to go directly onto decks, so I found myself changing the text size, labels, etc to be readable and to fit specific dimensions of my slides, so after a few times I made a specific set of functions that covers these purposes. Here's an example:

        Notes:
            - 9 inches by 4 inches worked well on google presentations, but plotly works with pixels.
            - (9in x 4in) * 150 gives 1300 x 600, which maintains aspect ratio and exports well to drag and drop into the slides.
            - option = ""thin"" gives a figure that can sit nicely in the bottom ~1/3rd of the slide with content / bullets above
            - option = ""very_thin"" allows for multiple charts to be stacked when too many slices can appear on a single figure

This was more developer-friendly in terms of the data loading, but seemed quite a bit slower that the flat file approach when used inside the training loop.

I'm currently completing a masters degree in Applied Economics (with a listed stats/econometrics concentration) and I'm wondering how to move forward from here if I want a career in data science. After this semester, I'll just have one class left this summer. Unfortunately, I applied to about 50 DS internships and didn't even get an interview. I've designed my program to get a lot of exposure to CS (AI, ML, Adv. AI courses plus a research position with the CS department developing learning modules / activities for AI curriculums). My university is not prestigious, but it's not bad. It's a MAC school that I chose because of its affordability (It's local and I'm fully funded as a GA). I figured out after 2 semesters that DS is more what I'm looking for after I took those CS electives. I've become very passionate about working in python. I would really love to even have the opportunity to show that I can do this type of work, but I'm having trouble even finding a way to get an interview.

I always thought working a data science job would make my knowledge base grow, but it seems like in consulting no one gives a damn about your knowledge because no one cares if you‚Äôre right, they just want to please the client. Isn‚Äôt the point of analysing and modelling data to learn from it, to draw insights? At consulting firms everything is so client oriented that all you end up doing is serving to the client‚Äôs bias. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you modelled the data right, if the client ‚Äúthinks‚Äù the roi should be x, it should come out to be x. Then why the hell do you want me to build you a model?

806,datascience,My thoughts(rant) on data science consulting,"This is gonna be mostly a rant but may make someone think twice if they are thinking of joining a consulting firm as a data scientist.

So, last year I completed my masters and joined one of the big 4 firms as a data scientist. As excited as I was in the beginning, 6 months down the line I‚Äôve started to hate my job.

I always thought working a data science job would make my knowledge base grow, but it seems like in consulting no one gives a damn about your knowledge because no one cares if you‚Äôre right, they just want to please the client. Isn‚Äôt the point of analysing and modelling data to learn from it, to draw insights? At consulting firms everything is so client oriented that all you end up doing is serving to the client‚Äôs bias. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you modelled the data right, if the client ‚Äúthinks‚Äù the estimate should be x, it should come out to be x. Then why the hell do you want me to build you a model? 

The job is all about making good looking ppts and achieving estimates the client wants you to and closing the project. There isn‚Äôt any belief in the process of data science, no respect for the maths behind it"

819,datascience,Debating on degree path for data science,"Hello r/datascience. I am a freshman in college currently debating my choice in college degree. I am fairly certain that I want to go into data science. First semester of college, I was a comp sci major and statistics minor, and this semester I switched to being a statistics major and comp sci minor because I've always been in the statistics and math side of things in comparison to the programming sides. But now I'm more split as I've come upon the information that most data scientists have their bachelor's in Computer Science and their master's in statistics. For reference, data scientist/data engineer/data analyst is my eventual career goal. This might be a shot in the dark asking a big subreddit like this, but might as well try. Here are the options I'm considering, and the pros and cons associated with each.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Stats Major/Comp Sci minor -&gt; Data Science Masters. 

Pros - I'll be studying what I enjoy more, have more free time during my bachelor's (my university has an infamously difficult CS program) and I will be likely be doing what I enjoy more during my career

Cons - Much less flexibility due to a lack of a CS major. Having CS as a major is so incredibly useful, with the field of data science and without. I am fully planning on doing some WFH and traveling during my 20's, and that would really only be financially feasible and possible with a CS major (I think, at least). I would effectively be pigeonholing myself into stats/data as a career, which is what I want, but do I want more flexibility?

&amp;#x200B;

2) CS Major/Stats Minor -&gt; Data Science Masters.

Pros - Incredibly financially lucrative and I'll have the flexibility to pivot to anywhere in the tech field without many issues. 

Cons - More programming, so I'll be doing what I enjoy less during my career, as well as during my bachelors. Also less free time during college

&amp;#x200B;

3) CS Major/Stats Major -&gt; Data Science Masters (or maybe just skip the last step).

Pros - Combines the pros of the top two

Cons - Having a dual major might not actually pay off in a substantial way. Also I'd be taking somewhere on the lines of 6 classes a semester, even with the BS overlap. 

&amp;#x200B;

This could be the wrong place to ask, but what do you, the people in the field, think about this? My end goal is probably to become a data scientist. Generally though, I want to work in big data/statistics, and I wouldn't mind using programming to get me there, even though it's not necessarily something I'm over the moon about. What do you suggest? Thanks."

822,datascience,Concept Drift and Retraining w/ Interventions,"I'm a healthcare data scientist and was just pulled in to work on a model retraining effort. I've posted about this in the past but have yet to get a satisfactory answer. This is not the exact problem I'm working on but close enough for discussion.

The hospital I work for has a high risk surgery clinic. The goal of the clinic is to manage the care of patients that are predicited to have a high risk of complications following an upcoming surgery. The clinic has been fairly successful and complications following surgery have been reduced for the high risk patients seen at the clinic. This sounds great however there are 2 ""problems"".

1. When tracking the performance of the model, some business leaders are upset that the model is ""not performing as well as was advertised"". Patients with a high risk (&gt; 50%) of complications only experience complications 25% of the time. However all of these patients visit the high risk surgery clinic. 1 interpretation being that the clinic is successful in reducing the risk of complications. An evaluation by a separate group in the system also came to this conclusion.
2. Other leaders are happy with the performance of the moel and of the clinic but have not noticed some degradation in performance of the model over time. Patients with a medium risk (25% to 50%) of complications have have recently begun to show higher risk of complications. Potentially due to newly adopted surgical guidelines. They're looking for us to re-train the model in order to better classify some patients as high risk.

The concern from the data science team I just joined is that 1.) their model is identifying patients at a high risk of surgical complications and these patients receive a series of signficiant interventions with the goal of reducing complications. The fact that the model ""performs"" worse in production is actually indicative of a sucessful intervention. 2.) Even when leaders agree that the model is performing well, re-training could prove difficult. Almost every high risk patient has visited the clinic so their data is clearly influenced by the intervention. It is not perceived as ethical to withhold access to the clinic so there is no control group within those patients classified as high risk. This could *potentially* lead to a situation where a re-trained model actually de-emphasizes those that would be at highest risk because their recent data show fewer complications (presumably from the fact that the orginal model predicted them as high risk and they were intervened on by the high risk clinic).

We have a few stratgies, but I'm interested to hear what the community thinks. Concept drift is an frequently addressed topic but I seem to see very little about it in context of interventions themselves influencing the observed concept drift and how to re-train in the presence of those interventions. Especially in absensce of some sort of control group."

826,datascience,Data career in Europe and what others might think.,"Hey everyone, this post will both be a bit of a rant and one that is looking for advice from people that have similar experience.

Some background info:

I did Economics/Statistics bachelors and then a Finance masters. I've worked at a famous Investment Bank and then I decided that the career there doesn't appeal to me, so I've decided to jump countries and switch career as well.

I got a job offer in Vienna for a Data Scientist position for which I was really glad, since I barely got any interviews in Austria. Even though the salary offered was ridiculously low for an IT/DA/DS position, I accepted to gain experience and to get into the job market. 8 months have passed and I switched jobs, because I quickly realized that there was no further advancement in the position. Blocking any suggestion by management, low budget on tools, and no data standard. I got a Business Analyst offer where they pay considerably more (from 32K I went to 50K), but the job itself is completely different. 

\- Now, many of you probably now, that BA both can mean a data person that leans more into the business side, and a person that helps Software Engineers to implement new features and products. -

I am glad I accepted the new job, as the salary increase is simply amazing, but also am afraid of what this might mean for my future career prospects. There is no Python, no data visualisation or data analytics in this place, there is however bugfixes and a small level of SQL.

One thing that I really enjoyed in my previous place is that I was a problem solver. I was a DA, DS and DE as well. I set up environments, visualised data, wrote and deployed a programm that draws daily data from an API and builds it into our database in the cloud, and did some ML models. Basically I got to learn a LOT, and even though I sometime felt that I was left alone, I really enjoyed when I could conquer problems.

Now I am afraid that I will forget the Python skills that I acquired, and only will go down in this road where it's more about looking up datatables to find out why a certain program doesn't work perfectly.

I think I'd feel best at a job where I both work on Strategy and Data, but I'm not sure if that is even possible for me, as I am clearly early into my career. I have heard that Meta's Product Analytics role is something similar to this, which sounds super exciting but they do not have remote options working from Austria, so that is not an option in the short term.

I would love if this could be a place for discussion where others jump in with their own experiences, and also if more experienced people could tell me what I should pursue/try doing."

844,datascience,Optimization for model is taking forever. code already optimized. Want to consider cloud computing; any advice?,"Hi everyone!  

So I've been running and testing an optimization problem on my computer for weeks now and I'm getting tired of it taking so long.  I was wondering if any of ya'll had any success with using cloud computing to speed up the computational process.  I'm currently using an AMD threadripper 2950 at full utilization. 

I know nothing of cloud computing or anything.  What I'm hoping for is to add a few lines of code to my project or to upload my code to somewhere online, and then I'll be able to use cloud computer or IBM's mega super computers or whatever to run my code incredibly quickly and get the results.  TBH, I'm still pretty new to some stuff and entirely self trained, so while my code is good, the only way I know how to utilize the outputs from it is by using print statements or printing to a csv or text file.  I have no clue how to run it from a command prompt or terminal or anything.  I'm using pycharm and I click the big run button to run it.  (sorry, my introduction to coding was java on eclipse and that's all i've learned, so that's what I'm using.  I don't even know how to step through my function in pycharm like you can in vba lololol)

 Background about the problem:

I'm using a genetic algorithm to optimize a good number of variables within a really large dataset and an incredibly lengthy computational process.  I've tried 12k iterations of the genetic algo and it still will not converge, and that takes 5 hours to run!  My code is already optimized as much as possible.  I've vectorized where I could, cut all redundant processes and calculations, reduced the number of data to only what's necessary, etc.  In terms of the code, it is very well designed.  Not because I want to brag, I had incredible amounts of help from insanely talented people, but because I want to assure you that optimizing my code any further is not a feasible solution."

I intend to build a classification model of 40 predefined topics based on text. One text comment can have zero, one, or more annotated topics.

I have a csv dataset with about 10,000 comments from social media, and with several columns representing the topics where I make a binary representation of the presence or not of the topic. However, one of the problems with the dataset may be that it is not balanced equally for all topics. For example, topic A has 200 comments with ""1"" (topic present) and 9800 with ""0"" (topic not present); topic B has 4000 comments with ""1"" and 6000 with ""0"", and so on... So how can I handle with this? separate all the columns of csv and work with 40 differents dataset balanced?

For example:

\--&gt; This comment: "" i like this product. I use with my friends"". It can be ranked with the topics ""satisfaction"" and ""personal relationships"".

Is an approach with an SVM classifier based on the binary relevance of each topic a good option (with sklearn)?

847,datascience,What is the best job role for my interests / skills?,"Hi,

Just wondering if people could take a look at my skills and experience and recommend the best job title for someone like me. I think Machine Learning Engineer is a better fit than Data Engineer for example.

I currently work as an Analytics Engineer and previously was a junior data engineer.

At the first role my job was maybe 1/3 python ETL pipelines, 1/3 dbt/SQL modelling, and 1/3 adhoc data requests. I quite liked the balance of this job, and the structure of sprints etc.

Current job is 50% dbt/SQL modelling, 30% maintaining old / buggy / tricky python ETL scripts (like web scraping front end of websites - simulating mouse clicks to download files - very vulnerable to changes. These are companies we pay money to but no APIs), 20% adhoc requests.

Personal projects:

I'm a former professional online poker player, so I've made various bots that can play online. Used some supervised learning techniques, feature engineering, then random forest regressors to create a decision making bot. I found it really useful to have a domain I was an expert it to practice some data science - so I could still determine whether the output was bad/average/better than human.

Determining ways to develop features for use was quite enjoyable, and the power of the models was heavily dependent on that.

Here is a text dump of tools I have experience with and would feel comfortable using to create a tool:

Python

SQL (Postgres, Redshift, Snowflake)

Prefect

dbt

Tensorflow

Tensorflow Serving

sklearn

Ubuntu

AWS

OCR (tesseract)

I've created some other predictors in esports which I made available in an API would could be called through my website, and return the data through the website. This was using a docker container and tensorflow serving.

865,datascience,How does a horizontal scaled database work in practice," I am going to implement (over the year) at my work an ETL pipeline, but I am quite new to the topic and i can see that there are certain challenges. I will provide more background about my thoughts after I asked what I want to ask. I think for me the biggest challenge it is really hard to picture how I would for instance need to write my rest api to properly serve the data. (e.g. if I would flask/django/laravel or whatever)   


1. What do my queries look like if I have a shared database? Is there a system in place which will query the correct database. For instance, I want to have historical data and will have for every month a new shard (not sure if this makes sense).
2. Can anyone recommend a good learning source?
3. I thought about MongoDB, because I know that it is quite easy to create a new document, then I could make a dynamic connection string, with the name of the document.
4. What happens if I need for one request data from multiple shards or documents?
5. Is sharding possible with powerBi ""tools"" like any service which offers these kinds of data visualization? Or is sharding only possible if I will write my own APIs to serve the data?

**More Background:**

 so we have tons of user data, something like 2 billion entries with around 5 gb storage, which is still increasing exponentially. The master database will be smaller than our slave databases because we cannot modify the master database and we want to keep history in our slave databases. The slave databases are set up in a way that there will already be sharded, into a logical blob. This means the first ETL step is extraction and distribution between multiple databases. Then we will preprocess the data into datamarts and reporting tables. I think till here I know how I can make that work, but what if that is not enough. Would it be possible to shard the Datamart and reporting tables by months (into multiple tables or databases) - I cannot picture How I could then join data if I need the data coming from multiple databases (I think tables would work via ids)."

867,datascience,Looking for opinions of this article,[removed]
868,datascience,'start with a simple model',"I've been advised that in data science we should generally start with a simple model before moving onto a more complex one. I've heard multiple times for example that you should start with multiple linear regression before you fit a random forest.

But why? Is the assumption that you can get a simple model working faster? Sure a random forest might take more time to fit. But generally I feel like a random forest is faster to get working than a multiple regression once you take data processing into account. Here are things that I believe tree based models just deal with, but a simple multiple regression does not (meaning you'd need to take time to address them before model fitting)

1) No need to one hot encode categorical variables

2) No need to worry about the distribution of your target variable

3) No need to worry if your features have more than a linear 

4) No need to impute missing data (though it can obviously improve performance if you do). If an observation has a missing value for 1 feature just label it -999 or whatever and tree based models handle it, whereas regression falls apart

5) No need to think about what interaction effects you want to model as tree based models incorporate all interactions.

Also, with feature importance, its just as easy to interpret a tree based model as a multiple regression's coefficients

So when would it *ever* make sense to fit a linear regression compared to a simple tree based model like a random forest?"

I recently started working for a real estate company for the remainder of the spring semester as a contract data scientist.  As they explained the role to me, I would work with community growth data from various markets around the US and build models that can help decide which markets they should look to buy property in.

 I started the job a week ago and it's pretty clear that this is going to take WAY longer than they had outlined.  They have less than 10% of the data they desire actually collected.  They gave me an Excel spreadsheet with about 50 data points they are interested in; maybe half of them have a link to a source where the data ""might"" exist and the other half have nothing.  From my point of view, the data collection/cleaning is going to take at least a month (I'm working about 10 hours a week) and that was the timeline they had hoped to have a model built by.

1. How long I should stay in this position before applying to a real data analyst position? Keep in mind I‚Äôm about to graduate with a mathematical Econ degree with 0 full years of data analysis experience.

885,datascience,How can people studying science (researchers) get into data science jobs?," Researchers have curiosity to solve problems using scientific data. They have analytical thinking which allows them to troubleshoot experiments. They have expertise in communicating the insights and results garnered from their experiments. These values and experience can be of great help in data science domain. Data science focuses on solving problems by making decisions based on patterns and making predictions for the future using trained models. These predictions are valuable since they help companies improve their products, manage their inventory, develop innovative products, provide services using evidence-based insights and much more‚Ä¶. This makes data science the second most sought after field today. Based on research published in HBR interviews were conducted with 35 data scientists, and the notion that emerged was surprising. It was reported that data science was not just about infrastructure, machine learning and deep learning but more importantly it was about communication and storytelling. The article clearly mentions the challenges that data scientists face is their ability to learn quickly, and articulate communication needed to answer complex business results and explain the results clearly to non-technical stakeholders. The other challenge associated with data science was identified as ethics. 

The researchers use storytelling in their reports, publications, presentations, and conferences typically to create curiosity for the topic by identifying the root cause of the problem and narrating their hypothesis, followed by the critical thinking where they demonstrate the experiments carried out to investigate their hypothesis. Later they document results using different visualization strategies without technical jargon and navigate their way to the conclusion where they discuss whether the hypothesis was successful or not based on which a particular decision can be made. In addition to that, researchers clearly document and follow ethics during all their experiments. Being a researcher myself and worked in data science domain I clearly believe that critical thinking, quantitative, domain knowledge and communication form a critical part in successful data science projects. Based on the data I collected from reading multiple research articles and blog posts I can hypothesize that researchers can clearly transform into a data science role provided they learn some of the technical skills. 

The key aspect of a data science project is to clean the data. Data cleaning can be done in multitude of ways. Someone who is just getting started into data science and has no experience in programming can start data cleaning with excel by sorting, filtering, and performing other functions to select the relevant dataset. Later it can be performed in Python, R or programming language of their choice. Data scientists also need to collect, store, and organize data which can be performed using SQL and NoSQL databases. The storytelling can be performed by utilizing data visualizations wherein graphs and charts can be created using Tableau, PowerBI or other visualization tools to provide meaningful insight to different stakeholders. SQL and NoSQL database management systems, Tableau and PowerBI data visualization tools, Python, R and other programming languages can be learnt from a various online blog, video lectures and books. 

In addition to learning the data science skills, researchers also need to build a strong portfolio of data science projects by choosing a project of their interest and domain. Freelancer Gurukul has a list of some freelancing data science projects that can help researchers to establish a public profile and gain credibility in the form of recommendations from mentors and other stakeholders involved in the project and create an additional income stream. They will not only be able to access help from mentors at Freelancer Gurukul for free but also get an opportunity to network with experts in the field of data science from different domains. Their guidance will allow researchers to meet and go beyond the expectations of the given project and obtain recommendations and introductions in the data science community which will help the researchers to build a career of their choice!

In essence, I want to be able to take any temperature series for any lat/long from this dataset and quickly make a prediction x days into the future. 

In the past, time wasn't of the essence, so I used SARIMA, which provided very accurate forecasting, but now, because of the new objective I have, the runtime of SARIMA is far too prohibitive. 

In reality, doing something like taking the last 10 7-day SMAs, each 1\*365, 2\*365, ..., 10\*365 into the past within the dataset and averaging them out would be a suitable way to do quick somewhat accurate prediction given that its simply temperature data, but I am perhaps looking for something a bit more ""datascience""y and generalized.

To give it context (the DOB label not counting) you need a context like a person.  It becomes information when the DOB field/content is associated with a person (this is the context).

So another way of asking this is done do RDBMS tables contain Data or Infomation.  Should it really be called a Relational Info-base Management System (RIBMS).  Is a name field with the name Data or Infomation.

Infomation to Knolage

This gets tricky as to what data/Knowledge needs nailing down first.

"" Knowledge thus describes the collected information that is available about a particular fact or a person. The knowledge of this situation makes it possible to make informed decisions and solve problems. "" [https://www.artegic.com/blog/difference-data-information-knowledge/](https://www.artegic.com/blog/difference-data-information-knowledge/)

This seems consistent with the idea of DOB being Information. It says a particular fact.  DOB could be considered a fact and can be used to make a decision.  I.e. to contact them about an offer applicable to people under 30. Or does the fact I need other information, like contact details, to actually implement the decision mean DOB alone is not Infomation.

Be good if someone could help me understand this.  The literature seems very light on examples."

I started this job a few months back, at a National lab setting (in case that‚Äôs important). We‚Äôre in the process of writing up a paper for publication. 

A coworker decided to lead the paper and take first author. Well, said coworker actually has done nothing except create the initial outline, which consisted only of placing section headers. I filled in the majority of the content, wrangled other people into some, and in general engaged a lot with paper planning brainstorms. 

The coworker who should be leading has been been very hands off has enthusiastically declared they‚Äôre uninterested in writing at this time, that we should run with it, and he‚Äôll serve as the overseer. And, as far as I know, still in the first author role. They‚Äôve not mentioned stepping down from that. 

Is that normal? My experience has been first author goes to who did the majority of the work, both for the project and the paper, neither of which this coworker has done. 

I‚Äôm doing what my boss is asking of me, but I‚Äôm hesitant to do more for this paper that seemingly someone who has been very uninvolved with will stamp their name in front and submit as their own publication. 

Do I have a misunderstanding of how publications work? I want to know if I‚Äôd be out of line in not continuing to do a lot of heavy lifting on this paper."

I am currently a graduate student at studying Healthcare Data Science at University of Southern California, Viterbi School of Engineering. My undergraduate was a pre-med degree, as I had planned to go to medical school. Aside from my education, I served as a US Army medic for 4 years, and worked as a clinical research technician for 2 years. I have some knowledge and experience coding in SAS, Python, Matlab, and C++, but my skill level ranges from intermediate to beginners level.

My goal after graduating is to move to Dallas and hopefully find a job as a Data Scientist prior moving. My wife and I fell in love with the culture and community in Dallas, and we are ready to move out of Los Angeles. My dream job will be working in a Medtech, biotech company focusing in medical or clinical research. But Dallas doesn't seem to have many medtech/biotech companies.

But if you asked me about what's going on under the hood or to scrutinise why a model may be performing badly, things get a bit harder. Of course this is a part of ongoing learning that people who are relatively new to the field or do not have a stats background will have to pick up if they want to go further in their career.  


I myself - like many others new to the field - have self-learned practically everything via the internet instead of formally being trained or educated and I find that outside the help of youtube walkthroughs, when learning about algorithms through textbooks or other online literature, I struggle to get a good grasp of them in such a way that i can readily put them into practice and truly know what i'm doing. This is especially the case when the text is heavy in explanation via formulas.  


I am approaching 5 years of employment history within this field and tend to take on a lot of ML projects for different use cases. It's forced me in a good way to turn my learning into less 'how to code' and more about the inner statistical workings, best practices and so on. But i still have a way to go before the imposter syndrome goes away and i can consider myself somebody who actually knows what he's doing in the field and can take on more senior roles.

923,datascience,Looking for some guidance on how to approach my career progression,"Hi everyone!

This is a bit long, hoping anyone with time can read through it and can provide some guidance.

I am a bit lost in my current situation and was hoping to get some guidance from you around how I can manage my career moving forward. I am trying to understand if the skills I have could make me desirable and what kind of roles I should be looking into.

**Background**

I am an industrial engineer, I started my career 10 years ago implementing Linear programming models (in strategic network optimisation, Oracle) for around 3.5 years in the supply chain space (Network design, production planning optimisation and a bit of simulation models) . Then I got a sabbatical break of 2 years and I have been in procurement and supply chain management consulting for the last 7-8 years. I am currently at a manager level. In this space I have been around analytics but not as advanced as what I did before other than dealing with bigger data sets (1-2 GBs max, not that massive in the big scheme of things, but anyways).

I do possess a lot of functional supply chain experience since I have worked in projects all across the supply chain (Sourcing, production planning, transport, warehousing, scheduling, cost to serve models, financial modelling, scenario modelling, supply chain strategy, etc.) in many different industries (retail, FMCG, resources, manufacturing, government, etc.)

My coding skills are limited, I can make sort of complex VBA macros in excel but that's it. I gave python a try a few times in the last few years and I always drop it. I learn better while doing actual work than academically, finding a problem and trying to solve it while investigating. I'd also consider myself quite proficient in PBI and Alteryx (although I haven't used them for around a year)

As for data base knowledge, I know how to work with them in PBI and alteryx (relate tables and do ETL through the funcitonalities the tools provide). No cloud or SQL experience or knowledge

As for math skills I have always been interested in optimisation, statistics, bayesian networks and simulation. I know the concepts, I do trainings/watch videos form time to time to not forget everything, I know what some of the common algorithms do even though as of today I would not be able to grab a python package and make a model but I would definitely be able to deliver it by using a tool (Think of llamasoft, strategic network optimisation or some other built for purpose tool). I would say I also would be able to write down optimisation equations, although I would need to have a refresh (I used to nail that back in uni and came to me very naturally)

I switched companies last year trying to get more of this supply chain projects, I am not getting them (low volume of projects plus building a network WFH is complicated). Even though I have seen presentations of optimisation projects delivered that were super similar to what I did in the past. I am sure I would be able to deliver those.

**Dilemma**

Two questions really:

Given that I am currently at a manager level, i**s it really worth it for me to learn how to code and some other technical skills such as R, Python, SQL or cloud data bases?** I feel I could deliver the project by having technical people on the team who can do that type of work, so i do not know how worth it would be for me. If so, what would you recommend? How much coding would I need?

From what I have seen in tutorials it's mostly using libraries that do all the work for you rather than making the algorithm itself, but not sure if that applies to a real project.

**Second question**: What sort of role can I realistically do in the data science space leveraging my supply chain expertise, optimisation experience and (not so advanced) IT skills? Would you, as an experienced data science person, would consider my profile valuable or are there any red flags that would make you hesitate of having me in your team for delivering a supply chain related project?

Much appreciated!

Thanks"

Suppose we want to measure the impact of a new feature across multiple dimensions such as Revenue, user experience, engagement, cost.
1. Can I construct a composite index by weighing each of the 4 dimensions and test for statistically significant lift between control and test group? I plan to standardize each metric using pooled sample mean and variance and then weight each metric based on subjective guidance. Will this work or is there any fundamental flaw to this approach?
2. Is it typical to first segment the user base into segments (geography, platform, device etc.) and variants  of the new feature to run the experiment? Would we then be running#of experiments = #of segment * #of variants? 
3. How do you handle primacy/novelty effects?

928,datascience,Data Scientist to Data Engineer,"[Duplicating my post from #dataengineering for your kind feedbacks]

Hey folks. I‚Äôve been working as a data scientist for the past 3 years in the Canadian fintech industry, on top of my regular, or traditional if you may, data science/analysis or machine learning projects, I got more and more involved with building automated ETL pipelines and cloud infrastructure and ML API development. I started a few weeks ago to apply for some data/cloud engineer roles kinda just wanted to see what‚Äôs out there‚Ä¶. Now surprisingly and with a bit luck I guess, I received an offer for data engineer with a consulting firm‚Ä¶ I want to pick your brains to see do people usually move from data science to data engineering or the other way around?

A bit background about me: I only have a BS degree in engineering with a minor in statistics (I was told not many people have this combo but I did pull it off with a 4.0 GPA) not trying to show off or anything and prob not important but the reason I am bringing this up is the majority of my data scientist colleagues have a master or Phd in stats/engineering/physics, I used to feel that I was just lucky to be working among them. Not saying data engineers are anything less, but I expect data engineers are more engineers and not necessary need a Phd for that matter which is why I never did a master or even interested in going back for one‚Ä¶ honestly I was once been told if something is not working blame data engineer not the data scientist‚Ä¶. Lol imaging it prob would be a lot more stressful in that role‚Ä¶

So just want to know has anyone done this switch or the other way around and do you think you‚Äôve made the correct move? What would you consider before making any decisions?

Thanks in advance :)"
929,datascience,Expectations for a Data Scientists at startups with little equity,"I am posting from the perspective of a data scientist but this likely applies to many disciplines. I would like to hear from my fellow data scientists out there who work for startups.

Startup culture dictates that you're going to be juggling a lot of things at  once. The pressure is high and you need to deliver. It's not your normal  9-to-5.

That is an acceptable expectation when  you are given a nice stake in the company in terms of equity or high salary. But is that an acceptable expectation when you're paid market rate (or lower) with low equity?

It would seem to me that if you're paid market rate but not given equity, the position should not be treated much differently than a non-startup role: 9-5 with the occasional late night for a project or issue. Do others feel that way?"

* What do you need to constantly learn to adapt to technological changes and keep yourself updated?
* How do you handle business decisions that contradict the findings of your work? Given you learned that strategy A works better than strategy B according to data, and communicated to management and they decided to go with B anyway.
* What kind of decisions that are really hard to make that you take on a regular basis?
* Given there are multiple data roles (data engineers, data analysts, other), how is the division of labor? what is directly your responsibility, vs. definitely not your concern?
* How satisfied are you with data science career?
* What are usually the problems you are likely to face in any company as a data scientist?

948,datascience,"Query Optimization and Dimensional Modeling are Dying Arts, and it isn't a good use of company time","I believe that companies are waking up to the fact that the time of Data Engineers is better spent on creating assets and building pipelines, not maintaining a dimensional model or optimizing a SQL query. There are many cloud products (GCP, AWS, Azure) that have optimization algorithms that can outperform any human. I think that dimensional models like star schemas, are going the way of the cube. Soon to be relegated to outdated technology. Cloud compute has gotten so cheap, and cloud storage has gotten so cheap, that the cost/benefit analysis is now incredibly obvious: spend more on good engineers, spend more on cloud compute, and get more value per dollar.

I explain more about how Google is implementing this strategy effectively if you want to read more, but the bulk of my thoughts are above \^ [Learn from Google's Data Engineers: Don't Optimize Your SQL](https://ilovedata.medium.com/learn-from-googles-data-engineers-don-t-optimize-your-sql-43f0da30701)

969,datascience,Anyone regret not doing a PhD?,"To me I am more interested in method/algorithm development. I am in DS but getting really tired of tabular data, tidyverse, ggplot, p values, lm/glm/sklearn. Its kind of all the same and I want something more innovative.  I also don‚Äôt really have any interest in building software/pipelines. 

Stuff in DL, graphical models, Bayesian/probabilistic programming, unstructured data like imaging, audio etc is really interesting and I want to do that but it seems impossible to break into that are without a PhD. Experience counts for nothing with such stuff.

I regret not realizing that the hardcore statistical/method dev DS needed a PhD. Feel like I wasted time with an MS stat as I don‚Äôt want to just be doing tabular data ad hoc stuff and visualization and p values and AUC etc. Nor am I interested in management or software dev.

Anyone else feel this way and what are you doing now? I applied to some PhD programs but don‚Äôt feel confident about getting in. I don‚Äôt have Real Analysis for stat/biostat PhD programs nor do I have hardcore DSA courses for CS programs. I also was a B+ student in my MS math stat courses. Haven‚Äôt heard back at all yet.

My issue is that I have some comments with multiple sentences where in some cases, all sentences are about one stock and in other cases, the sentences are about different stocks.

A simple solution to this could occur when I'm manually labeling the comments. I could divide the sentences in the comment so that I only keep the sentences relevant to the target stock. The issue with this is that when I begin to apply the model to new comments, this won't work, as I won't be there to manually separate sentences by which stock they belong to.

I'm a seasoned data professional (mainly in the actuarial field for the past 12 years) and want to move into data science and machine learning.

Part of that has to do with me not having been in school since 2008, so am not as sharp with math and not able to figure everything out on my own. I tried study groups, but sometimes that's like the blind leading the blind. When I do pose questions to the instructors, they can be cryptic in their answers. I can understand that to an extent, but ultimately I was in the program to learn the material and was looking to them for help.

I am on the spectrum and have a couple of learning disabilities, what really works for me is being able to talk through questions not in a chat room, more one-on-one putting pen to paper. I don't say that to evoke pity, but rather to convey that I learn differently. To pass my undergrad in math, I spent a lot of time in my professors' office hours asking questions about any material I didn't get from the lectures.

I'm looking for an alternative way to learn data science and machine learning. All of the bootcamps I've seen are online, so unless they offer a lot more support that wouldn't be any different than the masters program I was in. 

I thought about an in-person degree, and still may do that if there are no other options, but I work full-time and would like to learn the material faster than taking 1 course per semester. In reality, I don't necessarily need the masters degree. What matters most to me is learning the material with real-world examples and having some support to be able to work through any questions.

The interview is 40 minutes, then 10 minutes for a case study then another 10 for debating my solution. And This, is where I'm a bit lost, is this case study some sort of counseling-like thing? or is it more technical and coding oriented?  
I need help on how to prepare for this, and examples of how interviews like this happen.

Plus, if you have any more advice or ressources please write them below or link  me to them.

996,datascience,Confusion and indecisiveness about data science/ data analysis,"Hello everyone, I hope you can help me with this,
I have graduated computer science for 5 months now, my graduation project is what made me so interested in DS because of the deep learning models and image classification I had to self study just to complete it.

Ever since I graduated i was looking for a job in data science, found out the being a data scientist requires a masters degree in most cases which I can't afford right now, so I found out that I can start as a junior data analyst then climb my way up to a data scientist, unfortunately I can't find a job in that either because every job i apply to requires a year or two of experience which I really don't understand how to get as a fresh graduate who can't even find an internship to get that said experience.

Anyhow, I am currently improving my skill set as much as possible by learning SQL, Tableau, data wrangling using python and it's associated libraries,playing with some deep learning models and machine learning techniques from time to time, but I still can't find a job.

Please tell me what I am doing wrong? How can I improve my hiring chance?

Ps:I have reached a point where no one interviews me or even calls me to give a reply, I am desperate and don't know if i should just change careers and go away from Data science just to try to make a living."

As some of you may know, Manufacturing Engineering is a subfield of Industrial Engineering, which I have heard is a viable way of entering the field of data science. I have some free time these next two quarters as I only need one class for Winter quarter and 2 classes for Spring. I purchased the course ‚ÄúThe Data Science Course 2021: Complete Data Science Bootcamp‚Äù by 365 Careers Team on Udemy to get some knowledge/experience. The course is broken down into the following parts: Probability, Statistics, Python, Advanced Statistical Methods, Linear Algebra, Deep Learning.

1003,datascience,Should I reject / hold out on job offers to do a PhD?,"Currently working as a research assistant / data scientist on a project at my alma mater. Pay is OK but was mostly in it because the project could have positive policy implications and it's also just a nice thing to have on my resum√©. Aside from that I'm working on a publication that should be done before June which is around when my current contract ends.

My idea was always to leverage the connections I've made and the publication to land an interesting PhD position. As a plan B I had been applying to strong MLE / data science positions in industry too. My strategy here was to draw out the interview process as long as possible to more or less keep the position open for me so I could buy time to see what interesting PhD positions come up. One of the best positions I was interviewing for probably caught wind of this, unexpectedly reduced the amount of interviews from 3 to 1, and made a formal offer recently with a week max to sign the dotted line. 

As for job content I would say it's pretty good all round *actual* data science position. There's a varied amount of projects ranging from standard uplift modelling to computer vision and NLP. The company has a full data analyst / business intelligence division so dashboarding would not be an immediate part of my responsibilities. This was my #1 priority when applying, nothing wrong with dashboarding but I'm generally bad/dislike ""story telling with data"" or anything frontend related.

Total comp is strong too, I'd say it is \~ 10 % less than a PhD in the beginning in terms of raw salary. Once  you factor in the bonusses it's \~ 30 % more, in addition to the fact that there's a structure of periodic raises and a PhD's salary remains static for 4 years.

It is very enticing to say the least both in content and salary. The thing is that IF I would have an interesting PhD position come up right now I would accept that, even if it's a financially worse decision in the short term. My biggest problem right now is that I think it's quite weird and unreasonable to reject a job offer based on a position/offer that may or may not even come.

1007,datascience,[College Sophomore] Need advice for learning/improving data analysis skills,"Hi, I am currently a college sophomore in the US double majoring in mathematics and computer science. So far, I have been interested in data analysis and data visualization as a potential career path. I think I am good in terms of academics but I am lacking technical skills which I suppose is a common issue. 

I participated in a summer research mentoring program which introduced me to R, and my mentor suggested me to go through Hadley‚Äôs ‚ÄúR for Data Science‚Äù book. I got through half of it and used some of my knowledge to create a poster presentation. It was pretty simple with a few tables, summary stats and linear aggression. Then, the fall semester started so I couldn‚Äôt keep up my independent study. I also work as a research assistant but I haven‚Äôt done much work there other than running R files or storing data in Excel sheets. The professor I work with recently introduced me to SQL. He said its really easy to learn so I kinda know a bit of that now. I also know some Java from the CS class I took this semester. Other than that, I have a bunch of leadership experience but its not really relevant to the field. 

I tried applying to 2022 summer internships but didn‚Äôt get any responses. I think some of my problems are lack of technical skills/experience, being a sophomore (I feel like most companies are looking for juniors/seniors), and being a minor. I will be 18 in a few weeks, but I entered college a bit early so I am not yet of legal age. A lot of internship applications ask if you‚Äôre of legal age which I think also puts me at a disadvantage.

Either way, I decided to stop applying to internships and wait for my junior year. In the meantime, I thought I would work on my resume. I am currently planning to finish the Hadley‚Äôs book, and maybe ask the professor I work with if he has any projects I can participate in. From my internship search, I know a lot of companies also look for Python but I am hoping to learn that through one of my CS classes in my junior year. 

Other than that, I am not sure what else to do. I know I need to learn different skills relevant to the data analysis field but then what am I supposed to do after I have learned the content. People say to practice but I don‚Äôt understand what that means. Even with R, I feel like I have forgotten a lot of what I learned a few months ago. I would probably remember stuff once I pick up the Hadley‚Äôs book, but how can I make sure that I maintain my skills? I know I said I will ask my professor but I am not sure if he will have something for me. If not, I will probably have to practice with my own projects but I don‚Äôt get how that works. Like where do I start? How do I come up with a project on my own? How do I find a way to apply my skills and not only maintain them but also improve? 

This was a long post, but I wanted to give enough context and what my current plans are. I am basically looking for any advice pertaining to the questions I asked or the data analytics fields in general. Also, if you think I should try learning some other skills before applying to internships next year, let me know of those as well."

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I am a first-semester AI student working part-time in an insurance startup-like company. I have been a software engineer before and enjoyed it a lot but then I decided to go into AI because I was fascinated by neural networks. And now I am starting with Data Science in my company as the first one to ever do datascience there, so I have a lot of possibilities and freedom in work. 

A few days in to the new data science role I am kind of bored. From what I have experienced, 90% of the work is just cleaning data which is not the most interesting work for me. It is okay, but it sure does not excite me. 

10% on the other hand are modelling, training, evaluating which are absolutely fascinating in my opinion. 

&amp;#x200B;

But also troubleshooting a model is more like alchemy than engineering. Coming from software engineering were debugging is straight-forward, the trouble shooting in data science is also such a bad experience.

I am not aspiring to be a data scientist. I'm older (early 40s) and with no education or background in the field, it will be highly improbable/almost impossible. However, I have noticed Data sicence or Data analytic 'associate' or even 'assistant' type of jobs and as this field is growing, I'm positive there will be more of these, and not all of them will be filled by graduates in the field. 

So what should I study to get in this field? Yes, I'm older, but I can dedicate about 20 hours of study in the next 2 years on this. So you will agree that is a lot of study. My goal is to eventually get a WFH/digital nomad type of job. Is this realistic? 

Starting point: almost 0. 

But this is what I can highlight:
-  bachelor in business (accounting major)
-  master in management (quite useless, waste if money and time) 
- many years of irrelevant experience (civil service, mostly in social policy - never really worked in accounting or finance, not that it matters)
- decent excel skills - not advanced but I can handle some basic data visualisation (simple data analysis, building dashboards)
- beginning Python - completed an introductory book (python crash course) and coded along, doing 'Automate the boring stuff' now 
- pretty poor math from data science perspective, but confident at highschool level math ( algebra 1, algebra 2). I have never done any calculus or linear algebra or anything remotely advanced 
- University introductory course in statistics and some self-teaching since: nothing advanced but definitely comfortable with basic concepts, especially descriptive statistics. Some basic experience with statistical software (SPSS)

Any advice/thoughts where to take this? Im not sure of I should or if I should focus my attention on something else (e.g. web development) to get a remote job. I'd prefer data science many times over web development, and would learn more math if necessary. However, not sure how viable learning math is on my own at that level. Will I need to get really conversant with calculus, linear algebra? And what about other stuff like relational databases, advanced statistics, Java, algorithms, R, BI, etc?

Any self-taught people here who can offer me advice?

Should I try to specialise in something and learn it really well?

1034,datascience,Any advice to Engineer to switch to Data Scientist? Is MSc a good starting point?,"Good day everyone, I am an Engineer who wants to start a career as a Data Scientist and I am looking for some advices based on my background and my goals.

Any comments on my decisions are more than welcome as I must have overlooked some factors as an outsider of the DS field.

Background:

1. MEng in Civil Engineering in 2017 in UK (Upper second/GPA 3.3) and have been working in this field for 4 years.
2. No proper training on Computer Science and Programming (except a module that MatLab was briefly taught but I doubt that counts).
3. Self-taught Python to a beginner-intermediate level

I recently discovered my interest in data and algorithms, and have been watching Andrew Ng's courses on YouTube.  I am aware of the course is just a fraction of DS but I would say that I enjoyed the entire course so much and truly appreciated the idea of ML.

In a practical perspective, I believe the demand on DS will continue to grow while Engineers might have reached its peak.  I only have a smattering of understanding of DS but I find it much more interesting and fulfilling than my current career.

My Goals:

1. To learn competitive skills and start working in the field of DS.
2. To work in the Big Techs (Tesla, FAANG etc) (Probably the long term goal)

Questions:

1. Is a DS MSc the most direct way to switch to DS?
2. Is a DS MSc useful if I have no CS background at all?
3. Is a DS MSc really worth the time and money?
4. What things should I be aware of when deciding which Course to go for?
5. Should I study in the US if I eventually want to work in the US?
6. What skillsets are potentially advantageous for applying a Uni with better ranking/reputation?

I am in my 3rd year right now and have about 5 months worth of internship experience right now, (research analyst intern), and i have landed an internship for another 6 months working for micron as a new product life cycle intern. 

&amp;#x200B;

i do think i have a good amount of time and i plan on using it wisely, i havent narrowed down what exactly i want to do for my masters but if there is anyone i could talk to or reach out to, to get abit more information about this, that would be swell,

1039,datascience,How much will companies want to ‚Äútrain up‚Äù a candidate on the engineering aspects of data science,"I‚Äôm an undergrad stats major / math minor whose taken lots of coursework with regards to statistics and theory, and how to use R for analysis. I took only two software dev courses in Java, and only know python for data analysis and SQL. My background, and my future interests in getting a masters in statistics, would put me in the position of a ‚Äúanalysis man‚Äù data science archetype. Someone who could do analysis for days, do some modeling in a rmarkdown or colab, and talk about insights, and at minimum put it on a dashboard. But no real cloud experience, software engineering, or anything like that.

I‚Äôve heard that having a stats background in data science is a great choice, but I‚Äôm wondering as to how much coaching I‚Äôd get on the engineering aspects of data science. I know for a fact that even though I have a stats background I won‚Äôt be only doing modeling and analysis and I‚Äôd be expected to do data engineering and deployment to an extent. But my worry is, that I‚Äôd either a) end up at a company who doesn‚Äôt care enough to teach me it and just pigeonhole me in an analysis role or b) I‚Äôd be expected to learn everything, which I‚Äôd prefer, but the added pressure of learning everything fast, despite having minimum software dev experience.

Would my value as a stats background be more from a product analytics standpoint? Of something more product facing / minimum analysis and no engineering? Or would I be coached and trained to the engineering? This may vary of course tremendously on many factors but I wanted to hear what you guys had to say."

So right now an opening for data analyst has come and placement cell is saying that we should apply for this position, as like we should not lose an opportunity to get hired...

In all sense I definitely would like to do a job, but I also want to study further in data science domain and freshly start as a data scientist, full time or internship it doesn't matter as long as it is related to DS

So my main question is what will be the best possible outcome regarding career growth and experience:

1. Apply and possibly get hired for data analyst role while also attending lectures for my ongoing DS course and then transition to DS
2. Apply just for internship in data analyst role for 6 months (*will this experience even count while applying for DS roles in future*)
3. Don't apply just focus on your current ongoing course for DS

Also I've just recently started to get hands on by working on ds projects, performing basic tasks from kaggle, etc as my python and sql module is completed and soon we will start with python libraries such as pandas and numpy and further down the line with ml and other ml centric modules such as deep learning and AI stuff...

I had a quick question about principal component regression. Does anyone know if you can regress principal components AND the raw covariates that they are calculated from in the same model? For example, if we are predicting wage based on education, work experience, state of residence, race, etc., could we compute two principal components (PC1 and PC2) and later regress:

wage = b0 + b1PC1 + b2PC2 + b3education + b4work\_experience + b5state\_of\_residence + b6race + . . . + e

Would there be multicollinearity issues between the principal components and the original covariates? Would it make sense to do this? I have done this in Stata and it doesn't drop any variables for collinearity issues but it does help my predictions. Any help would be appreciated, thanks!"

I was not motivated to complete since I didn't really think it would use it later on. Here are some questions.



1. What exactly does a data scientist/analyst do? And how would programming languages help them in their work


2. I've never learned programming languages in college, I am mostly entering school for MBA. Will I only get a job in this field if I did programming in college?


3. Where can I learn SQL and python in depth. Basically I am looking for a resource that not only teaches me the basics but also how to apply them in data science


For context I'm from India. I just completed my college last May in marketing and I'm probably gonna join some MBA next July, so until then I wanted to learn stuff. I know like the BASICS of R, like addition and making graphs. Also I'm okay with learning this as a ""couple of years"" thing, where I start asap and I probably take a job in some other field and maybe pivot into DS if i am good enough.

In last 1+ year I've been trying different technologies and fields to figure out what I would love to do for the rest of my life. And few months back I realised that I want to ""apply machine learning and deep learning techniques in biology or healthcare field"". One more thing that came to my mind after thorough observation is that I love exploring new things and have a genuine curiosity about how things work, what can we do to improve something or how can we find something or some way that could solve a problem.

From this discussion I'm looking to address following questions:

What do you think should be the path that I should follow in order to make this transition? 

Is it a good idea to leave a highly paying profile to into research world where the pay will be a bit lesser?

What areas I should explore before making this shift?

1082,datascience,really feel like Data Science gets romanticized and people don't talk about the support aspect.,"I am not a Data Science person by trade. I did it for a little over 2 years because our Data Analyst left and I was the DBA. I am an systems engineer. I didn't have time to roll out PBI, Push Reports, etc. I did a lot of my stuff as canned SPs that I could modify quickly. We got bought and I handed all of that off to a real Data Team with the right tools and knowledge. But from time to time I get asked something and it is easier for me to run point so I can just get the info directly from whoever and sort it out faster than a back and forth with a lower tier of Reporting Support.

Yesterday afternoon I got asked about a problem where a user said a report was ""missing"" information. And to me - that just meant they expected something, not that anything was missing. Which is a huge part of DS  - managing expectations. Something I don't think people realize is a huge part of the job going in.

So I sift through the info and talk to the person reporting the ""problem"". Between them and the Reporting Support tier 1, I realize the problem is - they are looking at a Maintenance page and comparing that list to the report. They were concerned the report didn't have everything the Maint page had.

I needed to confirm this with the user reporting to establish y baseline. I send them the exact link to the Maint page and say, ""You're looking here and seeing claims that aren't on the Claims Status report on the customer side right?"" They say, ""No, I am looking at the Customer Side."" and send a screenshot of the report. I say, ""Right, but in order for you to feel like that report is missing Claims, you must have another list or data source you're comparing it to. Is it this page on the admin side. ""No, I'm on the shipper side."" Sends same screenshot of report. Me, ""I understand, but what are you looking at to make you think Claims are missing."" Him, ""Joe Blue confirmed on the admin side."" Me, ""Okay, where on the admin side did he look to confirm - how did he confirm?"" Him, sends a screenshot of the page I linked 5 minutes before asking if that was where.

Thank you all for doing the job so I don't have too. And I know there are a lot of you out there over qualified not getting paid enough because people don't factor in the above situations and how needy people are - especially Sales. So they don't think far enough into it to pay you to make dealing with that worth it. They think pay should be based on skill set alone, not an incentive to endure nonsense.

1083,datascience,Learn to be a math artist,"Numbers and Greek symbols sit on a page like clay. Learn to be a math artist. See applications in the math you learn in the same way an artist sees shapes in clay.  


You can learn to sculpt math. That is going to open up a career in data science for you. In interviews, I ask for an unconventional application or modification of an existing algorithm. Can you go from being told how to use math to creatively applying the math you have learned?  


Physics taught me practical applications of Calculus. That completely changed the way I see math. I had learned uses for equations in the past. There was something more visible and tangible that finally clicked.  


These types of shifts in thinking are more important than memorization. Applying research to business problems requires a math artist. You have to see an algorithm framed in the context of the business need. You have to see an implementation.  


Math can be generalized, repurposed, and applied. The algorithms and proofs are not static. Treat them like clay and you will build better models."

1086,datascience,Are tensorflow and cuda the best?,
1087,datascience,"Hello all, My name is Pratik Gehlot, I am a freelancer. I work mainly with Data Science and ML-related projects. If anyone has any project that needs to be done, just ping me, would love to help. üòä",
1088,datascience,Should multi language teams be encouraged?,"So I‚Äôm in a reasonably sized ds team (~10). We can use any language for discovery and prototyping but when it comes to production we are limited to using SAS.

Now I‚Äôm not too fussed by this, as I know SAS pretty well, but a few people in the team who have yet to fully transition into the new stack are wanting the ability to be able to put R, Python or Julia models into production.

Now while I agree with this in theory, I have apprehension around supporting multiple models in multiple different languages. I feel like it would be easier and more sustainable to have a single language that is common to the team that you can build standards around, and that everyone is familiar with. I wouldn‚Äôt mind another language, I would just want everyone to be using the same language. 

Are polygot teams like this common or a good idea? We deploy and support our production models, so there is value in having a common language."
1089,datascience,"Anyone successfully moved from DS to python developer or likewise? Was it any better, and if so, how did you make the switch?","Experience senior data scientist with a PhD and starting to really hate the field. I have a lot of experience in AWS, docker, python etc. and thinking about making a change.

I hoped over the years that this field would get better, but they anodically appear to be gettering worse. It just seems like the wild west out there. 

Employers expect far, far too much out of a data scientist. In my current role, I'm doing everything: Business analytics, research, public speaking, stakeholder engagement, Database design and management/model deployment, Christ even IT support. I spend half my time fighting the actual IT department to get access to the tools I need and the other half fighting to get access to data. The number of people who can't wrap their heads around the fact that to do data science, I actually need data is astounding! 

I've worked in big corporations, universities and big corporations, and it's always the same. The skillset is endless: statistics, ML (NLP, time-series, DL), production level python, cloud deployment, database management, Excel/VBA, tableau, SQL, and the wages in the UK are pathetic. I still earn less than my friends who know only SQL.

I am thinking about becoming a python developer. It pays betters and is a far narrower field of study. Anyone made the leap? If so what did you focus on?"
1090,datascience,Looking for beginners to try out data science online course,"Hello,

I am preparing a series of courses to train aspiring data scientists, either starting from scratch or wanting a career change (for example, from software engineering or physics).

I am looking for some students that would like to enroll early on (for free) and give me feedback on the courses.

The first course is on the foundations of machine learning, and will cover pretty much everything you need to know to pass an interview in the field. I've worked in data science for ten years and interviewed a lot of candidates, so my course is focused on what's important to know and avoiding typical red flags, without spending time on irrelevant things (outdated methods, lengthy math proofs, etc.)

A bit of background info:

I'm looking for a masters program in data science and Idk, I've been sort of considering studying in Germany. I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Science from an Indian University. I have a decent CGPA (8.27 on a 10 point scale). I do not consider myself a brilliant student, just barely above average. I have a year of work experience in IT, where I worked on a bit of AI stuff. 

My question is, how difficult would it be to get into TU Dortmund, and if I did get in, how difficult would the coursework be? I am not sure if this is an often repeated question, but I'd appreciate help. 

Suggestions on alternate masters programs/universities are also welcome :). Thanks in advance."
1095,datascience,Tool development. What platforms and languages to use.,"Hi. I am currently ""developing"" an analytical tool that connects user inputs with System data.

The tool (user interface) is based on Excel, as per user request. Basically users interact with Pivot table through buttons and forms (pivot table pulls fata from a joined User and System table). This means that all fields logic and data grouping is done via VBA, VBS and Excel Power Query. Can anyone recommend what would be a faster more efficient approach? I am proficient also in Python and quite comfortable with SQL, however users do not have Python pre-installed and fields will be added/removed so Python might offer less flexibility and the code/logic would have to be adapted constantly (just speculation, I do not know for sure as I haven't had the chance to use much of Python for data analysis). Should I look into other approaches for user interface in the future? What are some of your experiences with developing similar tools?

System data is pulled from different ERP systems, cloud database etc., during a nightly refresh, therefore data is always 1 day old, which is fine. All grouped together with Power Query, since ERP exports are mainly in excel. ERP offers other exporting options, however I do not know which extention will be easier and faster to manipulate. Any suggestions? l

User inputs are stored in Access database on a company server (E:\ - disc) and is always up to date. Because of the location of access DB and with VPN it takes quite some time for data to be saved and pulled from Access. My question is: Does anyone recommend a different approach for storing user inputs?

Basically I am wondering what do you mainly use for tool development that is quick and efficient, however still offers support of complex field logic etc., as I am looking for ways to move away from VBA coding into more efficient approaches, maybe R and R-Shiny?

Also do not hesitate to comment other experiences and experiences related to tool development."

1100,datascience,Best Data Engineer Courses 2021,"Hi everyone,

So I am a recent master's graduate in Business Analytics, where 80% of my academic projects heavily relied on Python/ ML, and the other 20% relied on SQL. Over time, I fell in love with the coding aspect of data science. 

After 2 months of struggling to find a Data Analyst job, I got myself a position at a start-up firm. However, the reality hit me. While the job description mentioned lots of SQL and Python, I still have to do lots of Excel tasks and have limited chances to work with Python/ SQL.

Therefore, recently, I have been looking into Data Engineering roles as well as their requirements. Unfortunately, I became overwhelmed by the number of tools and concepts that I need to learn. Its not that I feel lazy or anything, its just that I do not know where to start/ the correct learning path. Therefore, I strongly believe that having good courses can get me off to a good start.

I have been researching and found some courses such as ""Data Engineer Nanodegree"" or ""Preparing for Google Cloud Certification: Cloud Data Engineer Professional Certificate"". If you have done these courses, would you still recommend me do these courses in 2022? What about other online courses that you have found helpful for beginners?

1132,datascience,Smart solution to reduce an impractical number of iterations in a time-series model,"Hello folks,

We have a timeseries based ML solution that helps with anomaly detection and finding the root cause for this anomaly.

How it currently operates is, if I see an anomaly in a metric (if the actual is far from prediction), we try to examine the associated dimensions and associate the anomaly to its root cause accordingly.

For example, considering Covid related deaths across the US, if our model senses an anomaly (steep rise/fall), we try to break down the available data by state and see which state is responsible for such a steep change. In this example, there is only one dimension which is the state. So our model, in essence, iterates over 50 states - hence 50 iterations.

When we try to scale this up to multivariate that involves for example 5 dimensions (to the already existing ""State"", say we add gender, age group, income group, health rating), the number of iterations is going to explode. What was earlier 50, is now going to become,

50 States \* 4 Genders \* 10 Income groups \* 12 Health Ratings = 24,000 Iterations.

When such a model has to detect anomalies in say e-commerce data where the number of dimensions is going to be larger I hope you see how can't our model scale (at least without parallelization).

How do you guys think can we solve this? Any suggestion is greatly appreciated.

Thanks!"

1136,datascience,Predicting equipment failure,"Hi everyone, I am a data analyst working in a fcmg company where I work a lot with supply chain and production data. I have followed some online courses about machine learning &amp; data science and now I would like to work on predicting equipment failure in our factory so we can prevent that failure by doing timely maintenance or replacement. 

I learned about regression, classification, neural networks and so on. However I am not sure how to model my equipment failure situation considering it involves time series and predicting events.

I hope you kind people could give me some pointers where to look for further learning. Already tried kaggle, but like this person I am not having much luck: https://www.kaggle.com/general/28441

I know predictive maintenance and  survivorship analysis are existing fields, but most of my googling leads to too generic TDS posts or software/consulting vendors offering their services. I'd prefer to work on this myself as a learning project.

More practical what I am struggling with:
1. I am not sure what to predict: should I predict the probability of a equipment failing within x hours ? And if so, how much hours should x be? Or should I predict the amount of time untill failure happens ? I'd imagine that maybe after modeling and training/validating a model, I would run it every hour or so, to review if there are any impending problems with our equipment. So maybe if the probability of failure is above a threshold a technician has to take action.

2. I have a limited amount of historical data, maybe two years of data in which a type of valve I'd like to model fails maybe 100 times in total. There about 50 of this type of valve, some of them did not fail (so I could say this is a rare event?).  How do I model the timelines of the 50 different valves all together ?

3. Am I right in considering the 100x failure as the events to be labelled so I can train the model? And to train the model I'd need to split train and test data, however because this is a time series, how to I split the data? 

4. There are multiple possible input signals: a. continuous sensor values such as temperature sampled every few seconds. b. Measurements of performance when the valve operates , for example x seconds to close a valve. C. Errors/warnings generated on different moments in time. I am in doubt how to model this as input. Should I engineer features for each moment in time, for example average temperature last 10 minutes, last 30 minutes, amount of warnings last 10min, last 30min and so on? I'm worried that this adds a lot risk of creating the wrong features, as well as complicating the model.

I'm also discussing especially the last part with our technicians, as they know how the valves work. However these is no clear consensus about what the defining input variable is that indicates  failure.

My apologies if these are somewhat  incoherent questions, I really appreciate any pointers to books, articles,video's that would help me getting started because I'd love to learn more about this field."

Now the question is:

Given the dataset, predict how much contribution each channel makes to increase the transactions. And given a budget, find the optimum budget allocation to different channels so that the number of transactions is maximized.

I have identified the most important channels, and their order as well, using correlation. But my question is, how do I quantify it?

1170,datascience,When to go for an 'easy' time-series model vs. using a complex deep learning model (when having experience with the latter),"In summary, I have to recommend &amp; implement a demand forecasting model in a enterprise business environment where ML is basically absent. Linear regressions are commonplace for a lot of 'forecasting' applications and if you'd use holt-winters then you're a senior data scientist and people think you're performing black magic trickery. 

I'm a data trainee at this organisation. I wrote my master thesis about using an event clustering mechanism to enrich an existing dataset to improve short-term demand predictions, using [Pytorch Forecasting](https://github.com/jdb78/pytorch-forecasting) using the temporal fusion transformer component, and LightGBM (and compare the models with and w/o the event feature, so 4 runs in total). 

From what I gather, the current problem at work sounds a lot like a problem that could be solved using this package as well, as it's (1) tabular temporal (2) and has a lot of interactions between variables (3) would benefit from multi-step ahead forecasts (4) seasonality (5) also includes grouped variables (6) has support for multiple targets. 

My approach is the following:

1) Use something like PyCaret (latest versions) to quickly get results and show a PoC using simpler models

2) Use PyTorch forecasting using all of the whistle and bells it has to offer (or something similar, suggestions?)

Is this a sensible approach? Would it be stupid to use anything as 'complex' (relatively speaking) as something like PyTorch for a time-series dataset (especially considering no one really has experience actually deploying it in a production environment. Mind you, improvements in forecasting would result in serious cost-savings in this case, so it's not some hobby dataset."

In simple terms, I fed RoBERTa a variety of datasets describing the task of ""Rumor detection on Twitter"" while altering the class distribution in the datasets to see how it influences the embedding that RoBERTa produces. I evaluated the quality of the embeddings by feeding them to a set of classifiers (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM) to see how they perform. I used standard metrics (Precision-Recall and F1-score) focusing on the model performance in recognizing the class rumor. I was considering explaining it this way: RoBERTa takes in a tweet with a label (Rumor/non-rumor), then it weighs the words and their impact on the class in question. And words that occur often in a class are the ones that are potentially correlated to it. But I feel like that's too much watering down and even an insult to the intricacy involved in RoBERTa's inner workings. So for you out there with much more knowledge and expertise than me, will you please indulge my request and enlighten me on How one can explain the details of fine-tuning pre-trained language models on a downstream task."

1176,datascience,Quitting Data Analyst role with no job lined up?,"I'm in a data analyst role right now at a company with horrendously bad track record of data/data culture

All my work is internally focused and have been trying hard to drive some form of data cultural over the last year. It has gone nowhere.

 Attempts to form a decentralized team of data representatives failed (not a full blown team, but just a 'board' such, with individuals from each department working who work with data). These were met with positivity but failed to deliver anything, lack of participation from several departments meant myself and one other did all the talking

The above also didn't prevent silos. With an entire reorganisation (again I was mad no dedicated, centralised or otherwise, data team was setup), there was a massive landgrab and for some bizarre reason our Marketing department now seem to gatekeep all of our data needs such as sourcing/performing competitive data/ analysis, buying external data etc.

Most people seem to care more about having something visually represented at the soonest possible moment, even if this means doing so with 'dummy data' and collecting the data at a later stage. The issue with this, I am the one having to work with this 'dummy data' so get torn to shreds by anyone who questions where this data has come from (basically sale team put their finger in the wind and put some numbers against a product area lol)

This is a medium sized org, about 2000 employees and as an individual I don't believe I can do much else to transform this company's data culture. I feel like I am working alone as a sole analyst in a company that wants to achieve a data driven culture so they can say they are one, not so they can actually have actionable insight. I feel like most the work I do is severely limited by unrealistic timeframes, reluctance to collect meaningful data and inability to move away from a legacy way of doing things to a new way that is compatible with becoming data driven (e.g. sales team that appreciate the importance of inputting data correctly, a finance team that don't cut corners when it comes to reporting etc)

Sorry, went off on a bit of a rant. Basically I'm taking a part time masters in AI, and feel like I am learning more from that than this role as an analyst. 

I'm tempted now, after 4yrs in with this company, to quit and focus on my masters degree which finishes summer 2022. In general, would this be a bad idea given the current state of affairs around entry level data science roles?"
1177,datascience,Anomaly Detection on a categorical data set?,"Hello,

I am a student working on my master thesis and I am new to the Data Science Field (trying to switch from engineering to data scientist with my masters). One part of my master thesis is to do an anomaly detection on unlabeled data which (mostly) consists of categorical data. I've been reading a lot of literature and some papers which focus on data mining and anomaly detection but all of them use mostly numerical data when it comes to anomaly detection.

Since certain algorithms need numerical data (f.i. distance based algorithms) I am trying to find a way on how to use the typical outlier detection methods/algorithms on the data I have. The data is high dimensional (&gt;60 columns) and contains customer information.  
The only idea I have is to use hot encoding, which will lead to even more variables (especially when an categorical attribute has a lot of different values) but at least I would be able to do a dimensionality reduction with PCA.

So I am wondering, is there any other way than using hot encoding? I found a paper which lists algorithms which can perform anomaly detection with data consisting of categorical values but I (have to) work with PyOD, a Python library focusing on anomaly detection which does not have those specific algorithms (to be honest, I also had issues understanding those specific algorithms).

The task is to find out simultaneous processes going on, the time does not have to align exactly. Ex: We enter into P1 at 11:20:25 and exit at 11:40:28. And there's P2 with entry 11:25:25 and exit 11:38:12 (or 11:50:52). Both ( three) of these are categorised at simultaneous.  
My approach is to first make day and hour columns first and then filter out processes that have entry &gt;= and exit &lt;= with out first row. Then I compare the row with all other filtered out rows if there's any intersection between the times. The code is fast for 100/1000 rows. But I've been running it since 90 minutes and still waiting...   
The logic will be like : 
        for i range(len):    
     - filter out rows based on entry and exit
    second loop iterating over the new dataframe (around 500-1000 values at max, average 50), going over each row: O(1) operation.   
   I doubt it's gonna be finished soon enough. It's an assignment so I think there should be a faster way. Perhaps vectorization? I can't figure out a way to write an apply function that can take more than one argument..."

I've been feeling pretty sick of working the night shift at my current place, but because of personal familial reasons I would prefer a situation where working less than 7-9 hours a day would be normal. 

Only have 1 year of experience, as a Data Science employee I worked first in making changes to a website we were working on a site we made for a week's or two (used h5p and html for the first time in my life). Then took a PowerBI course that was made in-house, and actually made a dashboard for our massive client, as well as another dashboard made from customer surveys (we also offer data science trainings), worked with various Azure ML services, Synapse and Custom Vision, Form Recognizer as well. Basically a lot of Azure stuff and features (am afraid it actually won't translate well on my resume for some reason). Some basic video editing and uploading of our lectures on Vimeo, fixed some bugs (probably won't add this at all). And I think the last major thing was making ipynb files for a training and making content for big data analytics based workshops and trainings on Canva. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the companies for whom I've worked with on my resume, so I just wouldn't. I might be allowed some teaching into the trainings, but I don't want to clutter my resume with stuff the employer would not need.

I see a max of like 3 or 4 stuff I can add from here:
&gt;&gt; Microsoft Azure (Immersive Reader, Custom Vision, Semantic search etc)
&gt;&gt; Power BI 
&gt;&gt; Content creation for data science trainings

I recently graduated college with a bachelor's in math and was hired 4 months ago as a data analyst. Myself and two other people on my team have been assigned to this project (developing a knowledge representation and reasoning system). I think my boss thinks that because I have a math background, I'm some genius or something. I honestly struggled through my degree and got okay grades (major gpa was a 3.5 if rounded up). 

He's put the other two on knowledge representation and myself (and myself alone) on reasoning, which he admits is the harder part. I just don't understand. If he wants my reasoning system to cohere with their knowledge representation, then it seems like the knowledge representation part of it should have to be completed first. We've been at this project since late August and I still feel like I've got nothing, whereas the other two have code almost in production. I've contributed modestly to the knowledge representation part of things, but I'm always a bit behind the curve.

1191,datascience,How do you deal with covariate shift and concept drift in production?," ^(posted this on the machine learning subreddit too.)

To oversimplify, in reality you frequently have covariate shift (or just sample selecion bias) between your test and train set, essentially `P(X)` being changed across time. Aside from this there's the case where there is no covariate shift but `p(y|x)` is altered nonetheless, concept drift. From what I've read the former can be monitored in the upstream data but the latter frequently requires some feedback mechanism that involves ground-truth labelling.

I have a few days off from work per year to dedicate to research and I'm looking to tackle these two problems by implementing something that is 'simple enough', it doesn't need to be perfect either. I've started off by reading a number of survey papers and then digging a bit deeper with some more specific papers.

So far I've been thinking about measuring the distribution of the data upstream, either with process control charts or dividing the data into temporal windows and using KL-divergence to measure covariate shift. I'm especially hopeful of the process control charts as they may be simple enough for non-data stakeholders to understand. After this I'll consider a retraining / reweighting strategies like ensembles, transfer learning etc.

For the case of concept drift I'll just be looking to continuously provide feedback in terms of ground truth labels and keep track of the performance over time. Potentially plotting the daily/weekly AUC in a process control chart too. After this I'll consider (the same) retraining / reweighting strategies.

Has anyone done anything similar at work? Do you have any recommended readings? If you haven't - do you have any comments on the approach so far?"

How do you best figure out if you are getting ""market rate"" compensation for your position in your location?

I am definitely not compensated poorly, but I have this feeling that I'm leaving significant money on the table. I'm more of a generalist DS (dashboarding + metrics creation + bespoke analyses mainly in Python and SQL + minimal ML that is not / rarely productionized).

Compensation:

1. Base salary: 135k in SF Metro Area
2. Bonus: 0%. Could potentially get something, ""if I can argue why I should be given a bonus"".
3. Equity: at current FMV, if the company goes public, is equivalent to 15k/year before tax. 

Some brief background about my experience:

1. Statistics MS from a top public university in California.
2. \~1.5 years of data analyst experience prior to MS. Also, a 1 year internship with the company.
3. About 4 months into my current full-time position with them as a DS.
4. Company is a SaaS startup with $100+ million in revenue. HQ is in SF, but technical hiring is only happening outside the US.

Other relevant info:

1. I was hired by my manager's supervisor. When I tried negotiating my offer, he told me that I was an ""MS + 0 YOE"", hence no negotiation but I would be potentially eligible for a promotion next near. Yet, when I talk to recruiters, they tell me I'm a ""MS + 2 YOE"" as of now and want me to interview for roles with these requirements.
2. My team has shrunk from 5 to 2 in the past few months, and besides my manager, I'm the only DS. My teammates left to larger public tech companies / unicorns. I don't know if they left due to compensation. We are hiring more DS (outside the US).

Sources of information that I cobbled together to ""determine my worth"":

1. Glassdoor salary info
2. [Levels.fyi](https://Levels.fyi) information
3. h1b visa database salary information
4. Talking with recruiters

In grad school I became completely disillusioned with data science because it was crystal clear to me that we were using jedi math tricks(What my undergrad calc professor called statistics) to prove our own assumptions.

In grad school we made a machine learning system to analyze a photo of a face and guess age. Everyone was convinced it worked, but basically under the hood it just looked for lines, and wrinkles and since we were all white and asian that is what it used as reference, and it guessed our age pretty accurate. When I got a darker skin student who's lines were less noticeable under the light, it wouldn't reliably work. I just remembered being worried if that was put into some other system to authenticate age etc and how it would fail for certain people, even if technically the math worked out and it mostly worked for a large amount of people.

Hello, im currently working on a data analysis project. I did principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of the data. I noticed that the plot of PCs sometimes shows clusters in the data. How is this different from the clusters of kmeans? I was planning on kmeans clustering with my PCs I got from dimension reduction, does this make sense or is this common?

Also from an interpretability standpoint, what are negative loadings within a PC mean? Each loading in a PC and it‚Äôs value is it‚Äôs contribution to the specific PC? And if the value is negative it has a negative correlation with the response?

So say PC1 has basketball players with loadings such as field goal %, offensive rebounds, and turnovers.

And the values of these loadings are, field goal % and offensive rebounds with positive loadings, and turnovers with negative. This means that field goal % and offensive rebounds are each positively correlated with the response, and turnovers are negatively correlated with the response?

And interpretation of this PC1 would be, players that capture the most variance in the response are those that have a high fg%, great offensive rebounders, and efficient with the ball as they commit less turnovers?"

1234,datascience,I Analyzed 34000 Viral LinkedIn Posts With Tableau &amp; Found A Pattern,"Data  Science can predict what kinds of posts can go viral based on the  nature of posts that got viral in the previous days and months.

Today  we have so many tools that makes it possible for people like me who  don‚Äôt have a thorough knowledge in Data Science to still leverage data,  analyse it and gain insights.

**I  used Tableau to visualise a large dataset containing 34000 viral  LinkedIn posts.**

&amp;#x200B;

I downloaded the dataset from Kaggle. You too can do so by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/shreyasajal/linkedin-influencers-data). It‚Äôs amazing that this valuable dataset is freely available

&amp;#x200B;

What I wanted to do first is to **exclude the data of people who are too famous** ‚Äî  like Richard Branson. Why? Because the average person likes and engages  with their posts after getting awed by their persona. So there is a  bias that works here. Their reputation precedes their posts. To get a  correct picture, I had to remove such people from the list.

&amp;#x200B;

## Insights From The Visualization

So what exactly do we learn from this visualization?

* 9  out of 10 top LinkedIn posts contain- I, Me, My or You. This indicates  that subjective posts work best on LinkedIn. So don‚Äôt shy away from  giving your personal opinion on LinkedIn.
* Very  often we think that LinkedIn is not the place to talk about our  personal lives. But these viral posts indicate that posts on personal  affairs are quite popular on LinkedIn. So share what‚Äôs going on in your  life.
* Examine  carefully. You will see that many of these posts talk about personal  achievements. We often think that talking about personal achievements is  obscene. But as long as you don‚Äôt present these personal achievements  in an ‚Äòin your face‚Äô kind of way, people will love to hear about them.  They get motivated hearing about these achievements.
* Soft rants ‚Äî rants that are harmless are also popular on LinkedIn.
* These top LinkedIn posts are jargon-free.
* Most  of the top 10 posts that I presented preach something. But the advice pieces are not directly pointed to the readers. So theses posts are insightful,  but not preachy in a negative sense.

&amp;#x200B;

1240,datascience,Confluence as self-servicing analytics tool?,"I'm trying to understand if it's possible to use Confluence as self-servicing analytics tool.

My goal is to have a knowledge database where you can search for past analytics projects or routine processes. Within the page, there will be either github link or Excel spreadsheet attached to the page with instructions on filters and parameters so anyone with the right access can reproduce the process.

I chose Confluence because I also plan to set up a ticketing system using Jira. The Confluence page will have past Jira tickets attached to provide context.

First of all, do you think this is feasible? Will this scale well into the future or becomes a swamp to maintain? What are some of the potential downfalls and how could those downfalls be avoided if possible?

For context, I'm the only analyst in a startup. I want to set this up so 1. we have documentation 2. business side can run simple things on their own, 3. new analyst can onboard faster, and 4. eliminating myself as the single point of failure."

1242,datascience,What is your opinion about the various data science freelancing websites?,"I'm a data science consultant for a boutique data science consultancy company. Due to several organizational reasons, most of us get a lot of bench time (maybe even 3-4 months per year in total) but also my WLB is pretty relaxed even while working on projects. This has resulted in me having fully charged my batteries and having a lot of free time in general.

Since I have the free time and I foresee some extra personal expenses for the next year, I'm thinking of using my free time to freelance to make an extra buck. However, I've never done this before. After digging around a bit I discovered that there exist several freelancing websites (Toptal, Freelancer, etc.) and the reviews seem to be conflicting (some are very happy, others are not). 

Have you ever tried any of these freelancing websites? Is any of them worth it? Are any of them better than others? Should I avoid any of them? Any general tips about freelancing (either for those websites or in general for freelancing)?

For the record, the ideal deal for me would be to make an extra ¬£1,000 per month while doing small/fast projects. Is this something achievable or is it completely ludicrous and I should forget about it?

A few clarifications: 

* Yes, I have checked my contract and I'm allowed to do this. 
* I'm in the UK if that makes a difference."

The other was about the monthly prices of banana. Again, I explained why its cyclical.(supply/demand, it can only be produced at certain months, shipping costs), the covids effect on it.

So few things for context: we can talk about the R outputs, like what do the tests, models give back, but thats not the main point of the assignments so we dont get much points for it. Also we only went through some basic time series at that point of the class.

With all that considered what else could I have mentioned, analysed or what conclusions could I draw from this kind of data/model?"

I definitely could have done a better job at wording that post because I seem to be worried about the job title. In reality, I am more worried about the idea that the company I am interviewing with is trying to hire someone to fulfill 2+ roles. In my case they want someone who is going to be the subject matter expert in real estate markets as well as a developer to build out analytics platforms. Hence the whole ""both hats"" thing.

I've always thought you should have some (not necessarily expert level) domain experience in a companies operations, regardless if your role is a DA, DS, or DE. Is this a fair assumption? But now I am struggling to think of where to draw the line between the ""subject matter expert"" and the technical aspects of the job.

I am not naive to think that I can just be good at one of these fields and okay at the other. No. They are definitely going to expect me to be good at both fields and, well, I am worried that's a big ask and a recipe for failure.

1275,datascience,Is it a red flag if one of your analysts prefers using R on the job even though they know python?,"Hello, I‚Äôve received an internship next summer at a company as a data analytics intern. In the interviews they emphasized a lot about SQL, and asked me technical questions about it. But they also asked me some things about Python. Now, Python was the first language I ever used for data science. I used pandas, matplotlib, sklearn, extensively. But then, once I learned R and the tidyverse, I just fell in love with it because I was able to do analyses so much faster and never ran into as many bugs like I did with pandas.

I loved how ggplot2 just gave me such great plots compared to matplotlib, and as a stats student and used it in my classes I thought doing analysis and data prep just felt easier and quicker than Python. 

So my question is, I know Python, and if forced to use it I would use it. But would it be a red flag or bad if I ended up just using R for everything on the job? Despite knowing Python? Would you as a manager want your analyst using one or the other?"

I am 24yo and in Europe. My background is Bachelor in economics and then I did masters in Analytics. Aside of my experience during bachelor's, as part of my masters I did an internship at FAANG as a regular BI Analyst. My work mainly consists of working on ETL jobs, writing tons of SQL, doing Python automations and doing some dashboarding. Also we utilize cloud services (think AWS/Azure) for some solutions which I like.

I will finish my master's soon and there is a high chance I may receive a comeback offer for the same position. I like the team and although the day-to-day work isn't very advanced - I like it, there is room for growth and it is also FAANG. As a result, if I were to get the comeback offer - I would accept it.

However, I do feel that working in data science at least for a year or two is a must for my long-term career. I would like to work on engineering some ML models and putting it into production. Long-term (think 10 years+) I don't see myself as individual contributor and would like to become analytics manager/ or manage a small analytics team.

I see three options:

1) Accept the offer and just work for promotion to senior in 2-3 years and just continue growing in that direction.

2) Accept the offer and work in FAANG and then in few years try to move into ""Data Science"" position

3) Look for data Science position else where and immediately start building data science experience.

do you guys know of any real world examples where such a model could be useful? i know there are lots of predictive models that get back-tested and are expected to predict the future. but is there any use in observing a relationship at a discrete point in time for a certain dataset and then extrapolating to what i expect to be similar datasets for the same time point?"

My problem: I work for a large logistics company (US domestic shipping), our system automatically produces a ""sort report"" at the end of every sort with useful operations data. Pandas worked great for compiling these reports and finding useful patterns (eg. high no-reads on camera tunnel x). However, I want to get into image processing so I can better troubleshoot scan tunnel camera issues. I am able to gather scan tunnel image data from every package that is sorted (top, bottom, left, right of package). Along with the image data, there is tabular data such as the name of the shipper, destination, etc. The sort reports and image data are produced by completely different systems.

The end goal: I'd like to be able to organize this data so that the images are associated with their respective sort report and package data. I would like to eventually have an image processing pipeline, however I still don't know how I should go about even storing the data. I do almost all of my computation on an AWS Sagemaker instance.

I‚Äôm fortunate enough that my boss gives me as much time as I need to learn how to use various tools (like ArcGIS Pro as most of our data is geospatial), so I would be able to work on these courses at work. I would love to know what you all think.

1288,datascience,Data Science MS prerequisites. Feeling stuck.,"Hello all,

I graduated this past May with a BS in Data Analytics. However, due to a combination of the curriculum post covid, and my lack of awareness to self-teach alongside getting my degree; I never felt proficient enough in anything to pursue a Analyst position right away. These things include R, Python, SQL, etc. My school introduced me to these programs, but we never really took it further than that. After covid it was pretty much ""Do this assignment, oh and here's exactly how you do it on these slides"". 

I've always been interested in DS, so figured why not take this semester off, figure out what I want to do, then take action? I recently decided that I want to try for a DS MS degree, but now I feel like I'm in a world of trouble due to prerequisites required from most.

I've admittedly coasted through school most of my life. Never really tried unless the course demanded it, and got As and Bs my entire life. Some Cs when I truly did not care for the course. Whenever I \*was\* taking a challenging course, I would apply myself and do well. However, once that course was over I'd entirely forget everything. 

It's a struggle for me to focus on anything unless something is at risk. I think I may have undiagnosed ADHD, but that's an entirely different conversation. It's honestly embarrassing how little I can recall from my college education, including fundamental stats, basic coding, etc. despite doing decent (3.4 overall GPA, 3.8 Major GPA). I've tried taking online courses to re-jog my memory, but they cannot keep my attention, especially since I'm not being ""forced"" to do them.

It feels like my interest in DS isn't enough to justify pursuing the degree, especially when some of the schools I'm looking at have prerequisites that I clearly cannot match. I read some of the prerequisites and recall them, but that's essentially it atp. I cannot tell an interviewer much about it off the top of my head. I presumed that everything would be re-taught for the most part in addition to new things, but I was severely mistaken. Should I be pursuing a degree this early or do I need to reteach myself everything/gain work exp first? As I stand, I do not think I qualify for even entry level jobs. Feeling like a bum right now. Thanks in advance."

(heads up: there is already an implementation in place for this method but i'm not sure if there is not a better way to approach it)

Circumstance:

A meta-search website exists with 100 shops that post their products.   A customer can scroll through products and make selections (click) at which points a shop is charged for that customer's traffic. 

Each shop defines ahead of time with the website how much they would like to spend in total during a specific calendar month.   

It is the goal of the website and of the shop to 

1. use the total amount that the shop would like to spend within a month
2. ideally only reach the maximum that a shop is willing to spend on the very last day of the month.  This way the shop stays online for as long as possible...in contrast to using all of the shop's available funds in one day and seeing the customer go offline

&amp;#x200B;

Your only tool to control spend to each shop is to adjust the ranking for products. 

You can assume for simplicity that all shops are on the same page and that there is only one page."

At my first job, I worked for a team at a Fortune 500 company where I was the only data scientist on a team of developers. My team had no idea how to handle a data person so I was left doing ad hoc projects that were never used. I hated it there and left for my second company where, ironically, I am now the only data scientist not just in my team, but the whole company. 

Anything data science is brand new to this company and data is sparse. So now I‚Äôve encountered two problems: I am still absolutely clueless about data science cause I didn‚Äôt learn much from my previous job AND I‚Äôm working with very very little data
 

So I have a couple questions‚Ä¶.

Data science wise, what should I do when there‚Äôs very little data for existing products and when I‚Äôm expected to determine how a new product will do in an existing market? 

And life wise, what should I do from here if my goal is to make it to product manager in the near future?

I've been unemployed for several months and was just focusing on school until now. I was recently hired by a start-up company as a Data Analyst. Initially was super excited for it as I went months without even so much as getting a call back. Now that I'm in the role I have a few concerns and idk if came here to vent or am asking for help tbh.

First and foremost, there was no orientation. It was pretty much: ""Hi, this is the team and this is your assignment."" That was the entirety of my on-boarding. I am the only data analyst here in this company. Granted, there's a reporting department that handles similar project work as me, I am the only person in my team. I was really hoping that I would be under the tutelage of a senior analyst, but that doesn't look too likely. Maybe that was just wishful thinking. I really consider myself a self-learner and 'go-getter', but this position has me second guessing myself. 

I am assigned two projects which include forecasting the company's future demand in whatever environment in choose and automating some of their client processes using Python. Like I mentioned before, I know \*some\* Python and have experience with Excel, but nothing sort of an expert. I didn't think I'd be thrown into the waters day 1 and now I'm kind of reeling at the inexperience I really do have.

1308,datascience,Interview question - Data Scientist,"Got this during an interview. Pretty open-ended, interviewer said he was more interested in my thought process than arriving at a correct answer. This is how the question went (paraphrased, probably with some some slight errors), let me know how you would've answered:

Our company has long worked with social media influencers to market our products. We've always suspected that influencers with a greater following will lead to higher product sales than those with a lesser following. As a data scientist, it's your job to find out of this is true.

1. What data would you need to investigate this?
2. What methods would you use to determine if influencers with greater followings have more product sales? How would you establish that relationship, if there is one?
3. Suppose you determine that our suspicions were true. What would be some action items that you'd recommend (e.g. would you recommend we don't partner with any influencer with less than a certain following count)?

&amp;#x200B;

My answers, paraphrased:

1. Would need data on their following count as well as total conversions from their sponsor links. If we had data on following count growth through time as changes in conversions through time, even better.
   1. I mentioned one 'gotcha' would be quantifying following count. Some have many followers, many inactive or bots. I proposed some sort of total 'engagement' metric to replace simple following count.
2. Would start with plotting our 'engagement score' against sales. Sometimes we can visually identify trends before trying to quantify it. Then I'd calculate the correlation and R\^2 to determine how much of the variance in sales can be explained by social media engagement.
3. This was a tricky question, I kinda gave a non-answer that also sounded reasonable. As in we don't want to be rash and we can't establish causality, but if this is all the data we have, sometimes the best business decision is to make a high EV bet even if many other variables are unknown."

On similar positions, the company lists the expected salary on their job descriptions as

Data Analyst: $80K-95K  
Data Engineer: $85K-$105K  
Data Scientist: They didn't list the expected salary for these roles

According to Glassdoor, the average salary for a Data Scientist at this company is around $95K, but $110K for data scientists at the same company and area as me

This being said, I feel very unqualified as a data scientist because 1) I'm still in school and am lucky to even get a DS role, so I'm very much entry level 2) I'll be graduating with just a bachelor's degree whereas every data scientist I worked with here has at least a masters degree 3) Im dumb dumb

It was the second and final round interview at a fairly well known company in the area. I was surprised when I learned it would only be 30 minutes since I'd previously only spoken to the head of the department and even more surprised that there would be three people on the call simultaneously. I figured it would be more of an informal chat but all they did was ask technical questions, most of which were pretty in-depth and open ended. This left a total of three minutes at the end for me to ask questions about the job. 

The whole thing felt very surreal. I couldn't believe they would make a decision to hire someone based solely on this. (Needless to say, I didn't get an offer). Most of the data science interviews I've had have been at least a half day, sometimes meeting with two or three people at a time but never just getting drilled on technical questions for 30 minutes and nothing else. Has anyone else had an experience like this? I'm wondering if this is something I should learn how to handle better in case I encounter it again in the future."

1356,datascience,Machine Learning Engineer Job Offer - Client Facing,"I was recently offered a job by a company to work as a client facing machine learning engineer and I would like some input. 

**Here are some specs:**

* I graduate with a B. S. in Computer Engineering in December
* Salary is $77k / year
   * This is fine for the cost of living there
* I have two internships, one in full stack one in machine learning
* A lot of my job will relate assisting our clients in deploying our systems and data acquisition devices at their facilities and then working with them to clean up the data, make sure expectations are managed, etc. 
* Most of our clients will be companies that work in the food industry or in chemical companies. 

**Here are my reservations:**

* One of the main aspects of the job will be managing expectations for/ working between the clients, senior staff and our software developers. Basically I interact with everyone and that might be a pain in the ass
* Many of the persons who I will be working with won't have much exposure to machine learning / AI systems (Hence they are paying us) - this means that I will have to constantly re-explain basic things to new clients every 2 - 3 months.... I'm not sure if I want to deal with that cuz I did that in my internship with full time staff and that alone was a pain in the ass. 
* The state isn't in my top 5 states to live in
   * Not a bad state, just not a preferred state
* There are over 50 employees, I will be the 3rd hire who was hired more for skills / experience out of college than GPA. *(They don't even know my GPA)*
   * Basically, they hire a wide range of Bachelors, Masters and even a few PhD's - most of their current employees graduate from college with above a 3.8 GPA. 
   * Not that a high GPA is bad (most people think it is good right?) I have never been attracted to employers who use GPA as one of the main criteria for hiring people. I agree in having a minimum like a 2.75, 3.0 or 3.2 however I think any GPA floor above a 3.2 is ridiculous. This stems from many different things such as:
      * Having worked with 'dumb people' who work really hard to get good grades.  In the real world, you need to be efficient while working less than 50 hours a week. I have met many 'smart' people with high GPA who can't perform under time / resource constraints.
      * GPA penalizes students whose parents don't fund their college education. It's really uncommon to find a student who holds some form of financial responsibility for their degree  with a 3.75+ GPA. 
      * High GPA doesn't always correlate well with: being a team player, being able to preform well in a project based environment or having good communication skills
      * etc.

In the end, I will get exposure, get my name out there with some companies, do some full stack / machine learning work but it won't be the focus of my position. 

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I don't have other offers - there is always a concern here as well. I think if I were to look for more software dev / junior data engineer / full stack dev jobs I would get them easy however then I miss out on the machine learning side."

I want to create a tool or visual that shows clusters of SKUs that are commonly on the same customer orders. That way I can place them close to each other and the pickers will have their walking time reduced.

I have the data set up like this:

|aSKU|bSKU|OrderCount|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A1|B1|5|
|B1|C1|10|
|A1|C1|12|

&amp;#x200B;

The ""OrderCount"" is the amount of orders that both SKUs are on. In my head I'd like a visual that shows each individual SKU as a dot. The more orders that SKU ships on, the larger the dot (that would come from a different table). And the stronger the connection between two SKUs, or the ""OrderCount"", the closer together the dots would be. I'm hoping to find groups or clusters of several SKUs that are commonly picked on the same order and be able to place them closer together.

Luckily, my govt experience got me accepted into a a good DS-centric MS degree at a top-10 school in the U.S., where I'm starting my second (and final) year of studies.

Last year was a very intense walkthorugh of calculus, stats, and linear algebra, as well as a some R, and a lot of Python, SQL, and a course dedicated specifically to using (mostly) scikit-learn for ML.

This year I'm taking a couple of additional classes on math and stats, as well as some subject matter, non-DS classes. Regrettably, this means I will likely have to choose between taking a class on more advanced ML concepts than those I'm familiar with (applied NLP, deep learning), or another focused squarely on AWS products and general cloud computing theory.

Considering I want to apply for DS roles after I'm done with the program, which classes would you consider to be most relevant for real-life positions? I've heard tell that deep learning is not too commonly used (particularly not in beginner positions), but it does sound like something I'd want to know, if only for the fun of it, but I'm also not sure just how relevant AWS is to have in my toolkit for these roles.

I am a senior in college majoring in econ and have no idea what I will be doing after graduating.

I‚Äôve always been interested in the reason behind things/rational behind decisions and using that information to make strategic choices, which is why I studied econ, and I loved both the theoretical and statistical aspects. Ideally, what I would like to do in my future job would be maybe business/pricing analytics?

The problem now is I‚Äôm not sure if I want to do a ms in business analytics, because after reading some reviews on these programs many people don‚Äôt like that they have a lot of breadth (covers a bit of statistics, programming, business, IT)but not enough depth, and I feel I had this same issue with undergrad. They recommend instead to specialize and do mscs or statistics or an mba. They also say that the demand of ds is going down and companies don‚Äôt have competent data to use so data engineering would be better.

So now I don‚Äôt know what to do, I‚Äôve never liked math or been interested in cs/IT that much, I look at them more as tools to solve a problem. Should I just ignore all that and get an msba? I‚Äôm only considering getting one at my university(one of the cheapest) or at a top 5 program.  Or should I do a masters in something else? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm qualified enough to get a EL data analyst job, my undergrad was kinda weak, I only know R and I want to improve that and other programming skills, although I‚Äôm willing to apply. Also looked at being an actuary‚Ä¶..those exams are something else.

Also, if I were to work as a business analyst for a few years, how could I advance my career?  PM, DS, DE, or something else?

I guess they are too busy working hard to please JS coders with Typescript and Linux Windows ""fans"" with WSL2.

It seems to me that pleasing competitors including fixing their tools and languages to better complete with MS has been MS strategy for a while now. If MS was making Coca Cola, Anders Hejlsberg would be working around the clock improving Pepsi.

I've seen some attempts by MS devs to create some libs for DS/ML, but those seem unsupported hobby attempts - that is why they all seem to be either abandonware or feature poor.

ML Studio and ML Workbench are not what I'm looking for, as you may have guessed. I'm looking for pure C# code libs covering most classic algos for DS/ML/Stats needs, that could be incorporated royalty-free in custom closed-source commercial software just like one can do so with pretty much anything MS produces for .net. For example, one can include MS native .net lib for querying SQL Server in custom business app and license it to customers without any strings attached unlike with OSS libs.

I'm well trained in masters level economics, econometrics. I use SAS and Stata extensively. I've coded in R and Python, but my experience is relatively limited. 

Are companies interested in this skill set? What sorts of things (technical and softer skills) can I work on to make this transition as painless as possible?

1396,datascience,Forecasting Airplane Costs in Python,"Hello I am trying to forecast the total cost of parts for airplanes. I have an incredibly large dataset going back 20+ years across 50 different types of aircraft, and millions of parts data for each aircraft. My organization has generally used the following formula to forecast future costs (3 years into the future, very import detail):  


Historical cost of parts (last 3 years) \* inflation factor over multiple years = prediction 3 years into future  


The problem is the inflation factor is rarely accurate and historical averages don't generalize well to future predictions. So I'm trying to understand my options here. Because this problem is time series in nature, am I restricted to classical models such as ARIMA etc? There is some seasonality in the data, but there are various other factors driving the costs that I would like to run ML algorithms on the relevant data points to try to come up with a better prediction.  


I guess the biggest things I'm trying to understand are:  


How to structure the data so that the time series components to take into account the 3 year lag?   


Can other models be used such as regression, XGBoost, Neural Nets, etc. for this type of forecasting?"

1401,datascience,Climbing career ladder in Data Science/ Machine learning Engineering roles.,"Hi, 
 
I am a data scientist with 5 years of experience working for a major US bank in Bangalore,India. My base salary is somewhere around 20 Lakhs per Annum(LPA). I am an graduate from top 7 IITs of the country with a non-CS major. Lately, I am feeling that I getting underpaid because I am earning the lowest in my circle. I would be glad if someone can provide details about the following pointers ?

Am I earning less with respect to my profile in general as far as data science in India is concerned ? I understand there is lot of subjectivity to any profile but still any high level advice with respect to the objective details of my profile would be appreciated. 

Most of my IIT non-CS or NIT CS friends with 5 years of workex are making around 40LPA (without stocks or ESU) in software development. I understand that is not a good reference point but would it be safe to make a inference that there are relatively more high paying jobs for Software Development in India than for Data Scientists ?

I was pondering about persuing masters in USA next year with an objective of working there for 10 years and maximizing the capitalistic gains. But it seems there isn't much of a delta in salaries as compared to what it was 5 years ago. Are the salaries in bay area increasing as exponentially as they increasing in Bangalore ? ( The median salary for a good developer with 5 years of work ex in india is anywhere around 35+ LPA(50k USD) Bottom line is, I want to understand whether it would be still worth it financially to move to US for masters if I simply want to maximize the monetary component for the next 10 years?

Lastly, I want to understand what can be a learning path for a Data Scientist/ Machine Learning Engineer as far as cracking interviews and optimization of salary is concerned. For example, the contribution of Leetcode( coding practice) in cracking software development interviews is paramount. Improving coding skills (and work experience obviously ) probably provides the maximum return on efforts for development related jobs."
1402,datascience,[Beginner question] What is the right approach to reduce bias?,"I have a graph that shows how well an email campaign performs based on the time. The variables I use are send\_time and CTR.

This works if the number of emails being sent is relatively the same, but if the number of emails varies, it becomes a problem.

Below is a sample of a bias, a campaign that was sent at 2 AM (500 emails sent) performs better because coincidentally the target audience has a different behaviour than the rest of the emails, which has an average of &gt; 5K emails.

Is there a way to fix this?

1409,datascience,Is Springboard Legit? Possible juicy drama inside but I hope not.,"I'm officially admitted and supposed to start the Springboard Data Science career track in about a week. One of their most attractive features is that if you follow all the rules and still don't land a job six months after graduating, you get a full refund.   


However, I'm reading their Outcomes PDF which I asked someone to send me specifically. I don't believe most people see this. The data is from 2019, and says that 1,734 students have enrolled since the program started in 2016, and 389 have reported receiving a job offer. Initially, I just thought that was a lower success rate than I had hoped, but I should have nothing to worry about if I'm covered by the refund guarantee, right? So I went back to the landing page for the course, and noticed it says 3% job guarantee refund rate, and specifically NOT 97% success rate.   


So now I'm very concerned that of the approximately 1,350 people who didn't report receiving a job offer, very few of them were covered by the job guarantee. I'm suspicious of some underhanded 'rules' that might be very difficult to follow. And then if you aren't able to follow the rules, you wouldn't be covered by the refund guarantee.   


Does anyone have any insight on this? While I'm ready to give the course my all, my life would be ruined if I didn't land a job with a better salary than my current one and had to repay the course's cost."

1423,datascience,Optimal Course of Study,"So my undergrad is in (mostly pure) math (I'm not done yet). My school (Binghamton University) has an MA in statistics program, and an MS in computer science. I'm not really looking to be a data scientist necessarily (I think I would enjoy just being a statistician as well). My plan up until now has been to just do the stats MA (there is a streamlined program for math majors to complete it in only one extra year), but I found out today that it is possible for me to do the MS without having an undergraduate degree in CS (It would take some more work, but it is possible). 

I'm wondering what people think is the best route to do, if my goal is to have a variety of data related career options after graduation. I don't have a specific career in mind, really I'm open to trying different things and seeing what I enjoy. Should I try and do both masters? Only one? Which one? I know the answer to to this question is dependent on what career I want to go down, but any general advice would be very useful for me and greatly appreciated. Thank you.

The more I talk to people, the more I realize that everyone wants to get into this field.

Not exaggerating but one of them will not be able to do long division.

Being a friend, I gave them sound advice or so I think. I told them to do a ""Data Analysis"" course that will have less math(I checked their curriculum). Then try to get into BI field and after that think of becoming a ""Data Scientist"". Also told them even before doing all of this try to learn for free on YouTube etc. to know if they even like that. Starting from SQL (They have no idea what database is)

This whole thing made me question if that's the reason why people who are trying to find a data scientist role are having trouble or genuine people who are trying to break into this field are not able to.

1430,datascience,Career advice (and how to accurately evaluate DS job field),"Hey all,

Long-time lurker, first-time poster.

I could use some advice.

I am excited about DS and all it's applications.  I also have come to think that it's a pretty stable career to get into, since more and more companies/people are seeing the power of what ML and AI can do.  

Because of this excitement (and also because I didn't really find my last job that stimulating/feel like I was contributing in a meaningful way), I left my last job earlier this year.  I kinda dragged my feet on figuring out exactly what I wanted to do next, but eventually decided that I would start learning python and pursue a career in DS.  My reasons:  the future is digital and I feel ignorant not knowing much programming, the salaries seem great, it's a gig that can be done remotely, and I like pulling understanding/insights from data and presenting it.  From what I know now, I feel like I could be successful doing DS as a career, though I obviously have never had a DS job.

So for the past two/three months I've been focusing on shifting my career.  I can't say I've been doing it 40+ hrs/wk, but I feel like I've been learning a lot - a ton of python, a lot of pandas/numpy, and now getting into sickit-learn.  To keep me learning on a faster track, I was about to pursue an 8 wk bootcamp that would hopefully force me to keep learning at a faster pace and possibly hook me up with some potential employers.  The bootcamp requires you to have a decent exposure to python, and I now feel like I do.

Well this morning I got a job offer for a manager position at a different company not doing DS.  It pays pretty well (\~$115k/yr) , utilizes my background ( I have a PhD in chemistry), it's in an industry I like (cleantech), and is a job I could be pretty good at.  It's a job I applied to \~4 months ago, and I honestly did not think I would ever get called back for it let alone an interview(s).  

So now I kinda need to decide, do I stick with learning DS and hopefully find a gig after the bootcamp, or take this job, try to learn more DS on the side and maybe switch careers later.  More questions I have specifically -

1. How long (realistically) does it take someone to get their first DS gig, especially after a bootcamp.  3 months? 4 months? 6 months?  
2. What is the salary ladder in DS?  Given I've only been programming now for a few months, I doubt I could get a DS  gig that pays what this job is offering.  But after 4-5 years of doing it, my hunch is that a DS career would outpay a manager career pretty quick.  Am I wrong in this assumption?
3. I don't want to get into the ""don't do/do a bootcamp"" debate.  For me, I need something that forces me to stay on track, there's too many other commitments that I can easily get distracted with.  
4. Any other thoughts people have here?

It's just that I can do fine with my current job (machine learning engineer), but what these coding questions are asking is just not I would to while working. Examples like:

    x1 = element from list 1
    x2 = element from list 2
    
    find x1, x2 let sum(list 1 - x1) = sum(list 2 - x2)
    
    Note: I solved it by brute force, but to reduce time complexity I forget to use set() or dictionary() and failed.
    
    2. Given the an integer array with 2*N (N &gt;= 1), and we have to embed the block with size 2*1 (horizontal or vertical), find the maximum number of block we could fill with the 2*1 block.

First of all, hoping you have a wonderful day and week. Sorry for my English, not a native...

I am applying for a performing data strategy consulting firm in France, in their advisory practice.
Basically, they ""sale"" advices on important decisions, based on econometrics analysis and/or ML analysis.

My first round is a ""chill"" interview with a technical consultant, who will share with me is day to day life, and check that I have the basics in coding (python, ML algorithms...)
The third one will consist of a mixed business/ML case. Basically : you got problem A, you got dataset B, what do you do with B to solve A.

I am searching for any ressources to help me with both of those rounds. I found ""data science interview preparation"" course on udacity which is fine and that I'm currently completing, but I would love to find something else.
Anyone has some ideas ? Especially regarding the third round.

For context : I'm currently enrolled in a graduate program in one of the main retailer in France. Dual degree in one of the top french business school and a master in data science in top university. 9months as a data scientist during the graduate program.

I've got a pretty bad gpa with 2.8 in German grade ( I did B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering). Was depressed during the time due to family reasons and couldn't pay attention to college. Luckily I pulled myself back in my last year with an above 60% when I started dealing with everything in my personal life as well. But regardless of what has happened my grades are pretty low and it will hamper me going into a good public uni with English as medium of teaching in Germany. I'm choosing Germany because it has free education and masters are pretty expensive in my home country with no guarantee of ROI and I'm not looking forward to taking loans. I've going through a lot of stuff over most social media platforms to see if there is some hope for admits like me but there aren't any.
I'm going for GRE in an month. So I'm assuming getting good scores could help. I have 1 year work experience as of August 2020 in Data Science as well as an internship in the same field. But apart from that I don't really have any research work to show for.

We are building a data platform on AWS. We have the luxury to start from scratch. We have a demand to integrate a lot of business systems together, so the Business Intelligence part will be big. And we would need proper management, governance and lineage there.  
At the same time, there are massive IoT data volumes that would need a data lake and demand for advanced analytics, machine learning, etc.

The data warehouse guys want to use Snowflake for strong data warehouse and Business Intelligence. Data scientists want to use Delta lake and Databricks for the strong support of advanced analytics and better lake technology.

Both Snowflake and Databricks have options to provide the whole range and trying hard to build these capabilities in future releases. However, I feel like Snowflake is suboptimal for lake and data science, and Datbricks are suboptimal for BI and Data warehousing.

[https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/](https://github.com/BdR76/CSVLint/)

I work with research and laboratory datasets and often we recieve tabular data files that needs to be analysed or imported to a database. Due to the ad-hoc and experimental nature of research, the files sometimes contain technical errors or formatting issues, most notably datetime and decimals. Often these type of errors are noticed only after it has been imported or while analyzing the data, which can be time consuming.

That's why I've created this plug-in, to scan a datafile and quickly detect any errors. Typically this will be a datetime column that contains text, like a visit data that contains `no show`, or for example a lab result column that contains `read error` instead of a decimal value.

When you open a csv data file in Notepad++ the CSV Lint plug-in can:

* Automatically detect columns and datatypes
* Detect and edit metadata
* Detect technical data errors based on metadata
* Reformat datetime and decimal values (`MM/dd/yyyy` \-&gt; `yyyy-MM-dd` etc.)
* Reformat data as comma/semicolon/tab separated or fixed width
* Create an SQL insert script based on data

It's a work-in-progress and I plan to add more features and it doesn't always detect datatype correctly. For example sometimes the datetime format is not detected correctly, but it can be adjusted manually. Still, the plug-in can already do some useful things imho, so let me know what you think

(Btw it has some superficial similarities with [Rainbox CSV](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mechatroner.rainbow-csv), but it has extra data validation and conversion/reformatting options)"

I won't say that this was my initial plan when I first joined the company. I don't know how many of you can relate to me, but ever since my years at university I wanted to do research in economics, but then I think I realized that what I really like is data analysis.

So my question now is what should be my next step in terms of academic degrees. I live in latin america and I would love to migrate to another country. But for that, I know that what I have achieved so far won't be enough, so that's why I would like to maybe study a Master's degree. **What I'm not so sure is where to look for those courses, since what I've seen are just data science courses (and I'm** ***almost*** **sure that it's not exactly what I want)**.

My (non-finance) company is currently hiring for a role and over 20% of the resumes we've received have a stock market project with a claim of being over 95% accurate at predicting the price of a given stock. On looking at the GitHub code for the projects, every single one of these projects has not accounted for look-ahead bias and simply train/test split 80/20 - allowing the model to train on future data. A majority of theses resumes have references to MOOCs, FreeCodeCamp being a frequent one. 

I don't know if this stock market project is a MOOC module somewhere, but it's a really bad one and we've rejected all the resumes that have it since time-series modelling is critical to what we do. So if you have this project, please either don't put it on your resume, or if you really want a stock project, make sure to at least split your data on a date and holdout the later sample (this will almost certainly tank your model results if you originally had 95% accuracy)."

1474,datascience,How I use Data Science to Trade Options Around Earnings,"Recently I started a trading strategy around earnings releases. These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.

Like most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.

Usually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.

# Idea

The main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that ‚Äúspots‚Äù companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.

# Features

Since I‚Äôm not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:

\- **Company related**Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..

\- **Earnings related**I am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA

https://preview.redd.it/j4d85ntedqk71.png?width=1104&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de403fcabb6ce7cbed329500c26410cf8b504f9e

\- **News related**The goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :

https://preview.redd.it/ckukvav1dqk71.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cbee69ffd49960fc184df1f4fe94d776b0f053b1

# Target

Now that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.

We end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.

# Model

The next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).

We obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

https://preview.redd.it/564lw9dzcqk71.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d9dd9f460ff29ee683c291bb4304169e588e1588

# Results

To backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.

Looking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability &gt; 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we‚Äôre keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):

https://preview.redd.it/pkmnt7vycqk71.png?width=1368&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=02672a169d7c8249806be845b576a5195c642366

I use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning. I wrote [this articl](https://medium.com/@EarningsWatcher/picking-options-for-risky-earnings-trades-2d49dcb847e)e about that process.

1475,datascience,Help with project approach,"Hello everyone! Thanks in advance for reading. I could use some help here, so I'm gonna try to make it short and I will simplify it a lot:

Algorithm: Three-based.

Features: Spend ($), Feature 1. 

Target: Target.

I have Spend, Feature 1 and Target for every day, showing a weekly seasonality.

I'm predicting Target with a RECOMMENDED Spend for ""the next day"" right now.

First improvement: since I actually need a WEEKLY RECOMMENDED spend, I will predict weekly AVG\_Target with weekly AVG\_Spend. This way we also get rid of the ups and downs within the week.

Now, Feature 1 (which also correlates with Spend but not exclusively) correlates well with Target.

What I would love to do is adding Feature 1 to the model, but we don't know the value when predicting. It's of the same nature as Target (we could say it's a postmortem feature, and as I said it depends on Spend)

My little newbie mind could think of the next approaches:

1) Predicting weekly AVG Feature 1 for ""the next week"" with weekly AVG Spend and ingest it along Spend  to predict Target. Kind of awful. And actually it is not only Feature 1, but 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, which would imply having 5 models with 5 outputs to ingest those outputs to the main model.

2) Train and predict Target with Spend and ""last week AVG Feature 1"", but they don't correlate well.

I don't know if I'm explaining well (sorry about it), but as a conclusion, what I need is to include the information given by Feature 1 in the model, since it's a great predictor of Target, but we cannot know it in advance (as we could if it was ""day of the week"", ""recommended spend"" or so).

1476,datascience,Independent DS Consultant - Working with Midmarket Firm - Advice,"I quite possibly will dox myself with this post, so I might take it down after a while. Thanks for reading to the end.

I recently became an independent DS consultant in a particular niche (advanced analytics in designing supply chains) after having done that for several years in the corporate world.

I was recently cold-call emailed by a regional midmarket analytics consulting firm (not a Deloitte, Accenture, etc) about a client they were trying to land - as part of a broader potential engagement, they needed someone with my niche skillset.  I was happy to discuss, and ready to work with them, but that fell through apparently.

Fast forward a few weeks, I get another call out of the blue from their CEO, asking if I wanted to work with them with a large corporate client they're trying to land. The initial call that this firm's CEO had with their potential client, did not discuss ANY supply chain problems; so it was a little disconcerting that the guy assumed I was willing and able to work in an area I had no experience in (marketing analytics).

I told the analytics firm CEO that I am focusing on supply chain applications and I thought that ended the discussion.  He called me back a minute later asking ""If I ask \[BIG POTENTIAL CLIENT\] about supply chain applications, are you interested?  I'm not going to walk this back, you need to be committed.""  I gave a noncommittal answer, saying I'd be interested but not saying I was all-in.

Firm CEO emails me asking for my resume.  In response, I tell him that because I'm trying to build my own business, not just be an employee or contractor for another company, I would need to have a seat at the table in directly scoping and sizing the project with BIG POTENTIAL CLIENT. (I didn't put this in the email, but I am not eager to have someone NOT in my field, deciding what I am doing, at what timelines - that's called employment.)

Firm CEO replies today in a huff, about how his firm is ""the best in the business,"" and how he gets to make the final decision on all engagements including scope.

I'm torn. On one hand, getting started as an independent has been rough financially, I could use the money, and it has the potential for recurring business with a larger company.  On the other hand, I am worried I'm setting myself up to have someone I don't know, overpromise me and expect me to be worked to death like I'm some bodyshopper, all to give his company the glory.  I am also concerned about the opportunity costs associated with locking myself in with people I don't know.

According to the authors for HIPSM they used a survey data for base population and used propensity weighted approach to append additional variables from a different data source. 

I looked up propensity score matching online and it seems like a method to evaluate the effects of different treatments..which seems unrelated. Does anyone know how propensity matching could be used to append variables from one dataset to another? 

Thanks!"

1479,datascience,(Beginner Question) The Right Path towards Data Science,"Hello Guardians of r/datascience!

In 2019 I enrolled myself in a 4 year Bachelor of Science in Computer Science &amp;  Engineering degree. After a very thorough exploration of all the fields (as an outcome) valid for a CS student like web dev , android dev , ios dev and general problem solving coding &amp; data structures , I had a keen interest for Data Science . The idea of working with data and extracting crucial information that can sometimes change your methodology and also give insightful information has always driven my mind crazy. Let me get straight to the point. I have 18 months in hand to handover my application to Universities around the world for MS in Data Science Programs. As fellow Data Scientists , what would be your tips and what mistakes to avoid while learning data science from ground 0. Some common questions i'd like to have answered along with that :
1) What kind of Projects do i need to showcase?
2) How much time did you give in daily and how much time did it take for you to call yourself a Data Scientist?
3) Do i need to be a shining star in Data Structures and Algorithms?
4) And everything in general that you'd do before handing in your application to a University!

Thanks in advance!"

My question is, what are some state of the art, versatile tools that are ""must know"" or ""you really wanna know"" nowadays if you want to work with big companies?

I think I understand that I'll forcefully have to learn SQL, which doesn't seem too bad. Glue seems an amazing library that I started to learn. I guess I'd need to learn some data warehousing tool and so on, also I hear that Apache Spark is highly sought, but is it essential?

That being said, I think reasonable questions with solid answers are removed at times. I always pause to evaluate if a question will be removed before answering. If I think it has a good chance of staying up, I take time to type my best answer and it sometimes gets removed anyway. The problem is this isn't super consistent. I've seen questions removed about model drift, career stuff, CS concepts and languages in DS, etc, while others on almost identical topics stay up. 

Since the idea of forums is to share knowledge, I try to make good contributions when I can. It takes time, and if the post is removed it significantly reduces the impact of the commenters effort. Today, a post I commented on was removed with no note from mods. I see that a lot of work goes into keeping this forum clean and many posts belong in the weekly thread, but it is subjective. Some posts up now don't deserve to be given the rules (imo), while others are taken down for violating them. E.g. Do we really need another R vs Python question?

I don't have a full solution, but extra leniency would be appreciated if a post gains some traction and a comment was made with effort. I wonder if others feel similarly?

Maybe we should build a bot which predicts the probability of removal based on textual content, given past removed posts? That way commenters know the risk."

I‚Äôm also under NDA from disclosing my client. Pay is slightly above minimum wage. I despise the work, and don‚Äôt find myself learning anything useful.

I‚Äôve come to terms that the only option for me is to leave, because of the huge strain its leaving on me. And I‚Äôm considering moving country so that I can get a fresh start. 

I find myself in a sort of depression. There‚Äôs times I‚Äôll just blankly stare at my computer in work for 15 minutes, and can‚Äôt do anything. And then I feel worse afterwards. My parents often rant and call me useless for being in a dead-end job, and I end up feeling 10x worse immediately after. I then fall into worse habits until I pick myself back up again later.

1497,datascience,DS interviews suck.,"I'm a DS/ML Engineer with 4 years of experience. I fortunately have a job, but have been thinking about switching. Been casually cold applying to non-FAANGs without referrals since June, and I've been hearing back from almost every job application. 

This is my first time applying and interviewing since I graduated from college so maybe I'm a little late to this realization, but I find that DS/ML interviews aren't as standardized as SWE interviews. Even for a somewhat experienced person like myself, they are quite hard to prepare for. Yes, you can ask the recruiters in advance how you should best prepare but it really does range from Leetcode mediums to writing simple SQL queries. And the whole interview process is so time consuming to go through especially with a full-time job. 

* Company A wanted me to program a full model, write a 3 page ""technical"" paper on it and record myself for 2 minutes talking about the paper. 
* Company B wanted me to go through a series of recorded interviews where I answer questions on the fly and record myself answering, while there's no one at the end. Who knows how my videos are going to be used.
* Company C wanted me to take a ""fit"" assessment which has behavioral questions 
* Company D wanted me to do Leetcode hards.
* Company E wanted me to just write simple SQL joins. 
* Company F wanted me to solve a Leetcode problem over the phone (literally verbally code without any sort of coderpad and heads up in advance). In that same interview, she asked me SQL questions, linear regression questions, product analytics questions. This all happened within 30 minutes. 

The process differs so heavily from one company to another, and I am only applying to ML-based data scientist roles (not any product analytics). Most companies expect me to dedicate days and weeks to their interview processes and expect that I have nothing else going on. 

I also found that when I'm getting interviewed by a \_non-technical\_ hiring manager, they tend to try to make the interviews harder by pulling random questions from google that are completely irrelevant to the position. 

Are these normal interview practices for DS/ML?"

1507,datascience,Making Statistical Models for Small Datasets,"Suppose you want to build a statistical model which predicts someone's salary based on the weight and height (for people in your city) . The only problem is:  a terrible blizzard happened and you couldn't survey people - and you only have 30 observations. You must submit your model tomorrow and there is no more time to collect data.

However, you know some general information based on publicly available reports.

1)  You know the current population of your city. 

2)  You know the  current median, mean, 25th and 75th quartile information on salaries  (e.g. the median salary is $50,000, 75% of people earn less than $80,000, etc). You also know the number of people who aren't working.

3) Similarly, you have this kind of general information about current heights and weights. You know what's the average weight and height of people in your city. You have some general information on the distribution of weights and heights in your city.

4) 5 years ago, some researchers did a similar project and he has a dataset where there are 20,000 rows of data containing salary, heights and weights of people in the city. But this data is not current.

It's quite intuitive that on your own, 30 observations is likely insufficient data to create a model.

A) However, are there any bayesian or mcmc based methods in statistics that could allow you to take this ""prior knowledge"" (1, 2, 3, 4)  and your ""current information"", and somehow incorporate them to create a ""joint probability distribution function"" which could allow you to generate new rows of data?

1516,datascience,Question about setecting reduction of a measure over time that also has seasonality,"Hi, I hope this is not too long and cumbersome, but maybe maybe you can help me in guiding me in the right direction or maybe completely change my way of thinking about this problem.

This question can basically apply to any topic either be it Internet traffic each day for customer, customers entering a shop branch on daily basis, daily product sales, Ad click-through rate daily etc...

Assuming I have many products I sell. I'm measuring each product's sales per day.
I want to be able to detect when a product suddenly stops selling less than usual. But many of my products are seasonal. Meaning they have seasons of high sales and seasons of low sales. A season can be summer/winter, weekdays/weekends, end of month/middle of month...
But also there might be seasons I'm not aware of that exist that probably correlate to some weird unexpected stuff like end of Overwatch seasons, when Belle Delphine releases a new sex video (lol), when the Royal Caribbean cruises begin... etc... (seasons that are unexpected, obscure or even unknown by me but do strongly manifest in the data)

I want to be able to incorporate the seasons somehow in my alert system.
[Example of seasons and alerts](https://imgur.com/a/J6ZkaDl)
I want the system to automatically detect seasons for each product. There can be more than 2 seasons. The alerting system should compare the current day's data with the appropriate season and alert should be relevant to that season. No point in alerting on transitions from a high season to low season for example.

My first though was applying a simple k-means clustering algorithm that for each product will produce some groups of days of the year (or 2 years). and each day that comes should fall into a category. From there its simply checking today's amount of sales against that seasons' mean and normal deviation and if it passes a certain sigma - alert.
but then I thought k-means is kinda suited for a scatter plot style data. in my data theres nothing to scatter basically. so maybe it wont be grouping the days correctly.

My Second Thought was maybe generating a prediction amount of sales for the following days and if the current amount of sales is too much different than the prediction then alert. But then I though... yeah its probably not going to take seasonality into consideration quite well.

Also there is Change Point Detection thing - but this puts high emphasis on the last few days and probably disregards seasons like summer / winter etc...

What do you think would be a good approach to this problem? is it just a simple statistical calculation of mean and standard deviation? or it can be solved Machine Learning style?

Thanks a lot in advance!"

I'm glad to announce we have released Hora0.1.0, an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm library, which is written in rust. and focus on the approximate nearest neighbor search field, we have already implemented HNSW(Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph Index) index, SSG(Satellite System Graph)index, PQIVF(Product Quantization Inverted File) index, BruteForceIndex, and other indexes are coming. and we use SIMD to accelerate the performance, make it blazingly fast.

our slogan is ""hora search everywhere"", which means hora can be deployed in any OS platform, Including already supported PC OS, (Linux, Mac OS, Windows), will support portable device OS(IOS and android), and even will support embedded systems(no\_std). and we would support many language bindings, including Python, Javascript, Java, Ruby, Swift, and R. thanks to the LLVM great portable feature, we can make it happen.

1524,datascience,Imposter syndrome can really feel overwhelming.,"My story: I came out of college as a simple business undergrad, always loving my somewhat basic statistics classes. Got a job out of college at a major bank as a data analyst, focusing mostly on SQL and SAS. 

I became more aware of the major modeling done at the company, and at the same time company started to evolve, become more modern, and switch to a more R and Python based analytical stack. Self taught myself programming, studied through some online courses and pouring through all of Introduction to Statistical Learning (lol), then took an internal interview process and switched to data science. 

Total ~3.5 years as a data analyst and almost 4 as a data scientist, ending as a Manager of data science in the model risk office overlooking development of some of the most important models in the company, but still feeling like I was kinda one of those in between guys that doesn‚Äôt spike super well anywhere and is just technically behind on education in all parts. Like I guess my skill is I know a bit of everything, can understand business problems well, communicate, code, critique code issues and risks, do heavy multimillion row data analysis and risk analysis, understand modeling issues etc. But it just feels like I‚Äôm surrounded by super well educated masters and phds that are smarter. 


Burned out a bit, and planned to quit end of March 2020 and travel a bit. Covid hit, but I did it anyway because I couldn‚Äôt stand to keep doing the job and also wfh every day. Since then, i made some money grinding poker and also just chilled, being there emotionally for my ER doctor girlfriend who I live with (during a particularly tough time as you can imagine). I also study and try to improve my knowledge but not enough as I‚Äôd like. My passion is becoming more of a Bayesian, because I find bayesian modeling super cool and would be really intrigued when I‚Äôd see internal applications of it at my old job. Also studying a bit more math fundamentals and I also tried to learn scala (fail, too hard). 


But man the thought of doing the interview process really just deflated me and makes me feel unworthy. There‚Äôs just so much and I don‚Äôt particularly spike well in any of it. Can I code and kinda understand OOP, build large pipelines (slowly with googling)Ya. Kinda. I can get through it. My math kinda sucks I‚Äôll never be a guy that‚Äôs great at it.  My statistical modeling knowledge is broad and kinda surface and most of my practical knowledge are massive bank data logistic regressions or gbm. Tbh, I couldn‚Äôt white board gradient descent for you even though that‚Äôs and interview question I GAVE to others when I was working.  Can I grind it out and learn how to white board it? Ya but it feels like fake knowledge. 

It all just makes me want to curl up in a ball and cry sometimes. Makes me want to apply for some entry level SQL monkey job I did fresh out of college that I‚Äôm overqualified for and give up. 

Maybe I just have to go do it. I literally haven‚Äôt applied or interviewed for a external company since I was 22 (31 now). Maybe I‚Äôll get over it.  Who knows. I just find it very intimidating and that I‚Äôm not worthy unless I get some bullshit masters degree or something.

1533,datascience,How important are strong communications skills in DS career? I have vocal issues,"So I'd like to go down the path of data analytics/science/engineering to become data scientist or engineer. I'm  graduating as an MBA in my country Belgium.

In my first year I'd like to focus on the hard skills. I hear everyone I talk to and every company/vacancy talking about strong communication skills. Mine are fine when my voice works normal, but due to my vocal issues my voice is off a lot of the time which is a big hindrance to my career and social and everything.

But I was wondering, in data science, how important is strong communication skills?

And no, it's not about confidence or taking courses or therapy that'll help. It's like someone who has bad eyesight. No amount of confidence or therapy or practising will increase his eyesight, so don't come with clich√© usual voice advice that doesn't work in my case. It's not about shyness or anything, it's a physical mechanical medical issue that makes my voice go off. At times when my voice works fine, I'm very social and will easily present more than okay in front of an entire crowd confidently, but when my voice is off, my presentation in front of 1 people will suck. Usually my voice is okay in the morning and gets worse in the noon and afternoon, but it's mostly just very unpredictable, and sucks most of the time."

I start from the idea of units of measurement. If all 4 sections of the pyramid have the same unit of measurement, they are the same thing. Maybe they should have different units of measurement?

This is genuinely the first time that I encounter someone evaluating the accuracy of the model predictions like this.

The problem scenario:

I have 25 types of parquet data stored separately in 25 folders in a datalake (AWS S3).

Within each folder, the respective parquet files are partitioned day wise. The cumulative number of objects in all 25 folders is 50,000 and the cumulative size is 250 GB.

Now, I am in the task of building traditional models (so I will be using pandas.read_parquet) using this data. Modeling will be done folder wise (one model for each folder).

*The question: 

is there any industry-standard way of loading such **partitioned data** for EDA or for modeling?*

I can already think of so many likely issues:
1. Pre-processing logic on one day's data will not work on the next day.
2. Using all the objects in a folder by joining the tables will be costly as I will then have to use a bigger instance type.

Given that a lot of data science based companies either already have a datalake or are moving towards a datalake, I am pretty sure many would have come across such scenarios. 

So, kindly share your insights!"

Basically - you are given stock returns over a period of days (float values), distributed across several columns.  Each column is a different stock and the rows are the daily returns.  The task was to take the log return - accomplished, as I discovered, by this line of code:

`np.log(prices) - np.log(prices.shift(1)`  


I don't understand what shift did here, at least I'm not sure I wrapped my head around it.  I assume it simply took the natural log of the price in a row, and subtracted it from the natural log of the price one row higher? Am I overthinking this?

1558,datascience,Extracting Motifs from Assembly Source Code,"Sorry if this breaks rule 7, I am hoping that this is a somewhat novel problem that facilitates an interesting discussion that goes beyond what is typically found on SO.

I'm a first year software engineer at a small embedded software company and I am looking for some guidance on extracting similar (but not 100% equal) sections of code across several hundred different assembly source code files. To be clear, this isn't something I am being asked to do for work and I am not trying to outsource my job to Reddit. This is more of something I am interested in outside of work that could possibly yield some interesting results and I am open to any alternative perspectives on how to approach this problem.

In summary, we have a multi-decade old product that still sells well enough to justify hiring an engineer who dedicates \~50% of their time to maintaining it. This product runs firmware that is hand-coded in assembly. Any time a customer requests a new feature for the product, a new firmware file is created based off of an existing template firmware. If the feature is something we have added to an existing firmware file before, this requires diff'ing the template assembly file with an existing assembly file that has the requested feature included in it somewhere. **This is a horrible, joyless, time consuming process**.

There are several problems with this:

\- Each .asm file for a single firmware consists of upwards of 15,000 lines of assembly. Diff'ing becomes time consuming, and it isn't always well documented exactly which sections of code actually account for the feature in question. You may go through the process of diff'ing and building the firmware, flashing it over to the device, only to find out that you missed a line somewhere in the diff that was critical to the functionality of the feature.

\- The engineer in charge of this product is seldom ever actually writing code for it. This is a very boring and draining procedure that would benefit from being automated as much as possible. 

This willingness to comply with customers' requests has led to hundreds of different firmware being created over the years with slightly different quirks and behaviors from the base firmware. **I'd put the number at well over 500**. I'd like to find an automated way to extract the lines of assembly from our codebase associated with each feature in order to build a central database that matches the raw assembly subroutines to a name and description of the feature they implement. This way, we could develop something along the lines of a private VS Code extension that essentially allows our firmware engineer to search for assembly snippets by feature rather than diff'ing massive .asm files each and every time a new request comes in. 

I have one idea for an approach, but am looking for guidance or an alternative way to go about this task. Each firmware has three qualities that uniquely identify it:

\- Product version (2 possibilities here, let's say version A v. Version B),

\- Serial interface that the product uses to communicate with the host (8 possibilities here denoted by: 1, 2, 3, ...)

\- Special feature/quirk upon customer request (lots, denoted by: X, Y, ...)

So, for example, two particular firmware files might both have feature X implemented, yet one might be version A of the product running serial interface 1 and the other might be version B of the product running serial interface 1. The issue at hand is finding an automated way of determining what code accounts for feature X. 

So, one automated way to find which lines of assembly actually constitute feature X may be the following: 

1. Diff every firmware source code running feature X with the base template source code file
2. Iterate over the diff'd sections and note which sections occur in every firmware running feature X. These are the sections that (likely) account for feature X.

One caveat to this process is that the diff'd sections may not always be 100 percent the same even though they implement the same feature. There may be things like slightly different comments, different spacing, different label names, occurring at different line numbers, etc. There would need to be some sort of similarity index established that essentially says something along the lines of ""if two sections of code are 90 percent similar, consider them equal"".

Anyways, thank you for reading this far. I am interested in seeing data driven approaches to this problem that others might have."

I have to decide between joining two teams:

One team has very clean data and a lot of it, and the data observations are quite homogenous (car data for example). It seems like it's easy to fit models with this data and run advanced analytics. 

  
The other team has messy and inhomogeneous data that is not well standardized (sea animals for example - not all sea animals have same attributes gills etc), and can sometimes lack data. But the challenge in this team is doing data work, working with other teams and finding at ways to enhance data quality and find ways to work around this using qualitative methods not just quantitative. 

I'm wondering what team would be more beneficial in leading to a data scientist position? On one hand I see the benefit of the first team (no data headaches, and can just input into prebuilt machine learning models), but the second team may be more representative of what a data scientist actually does?

1566,datascience,How to prepare for PhD applications with a shoddy undergraduate record?,"So I wasn't a great student. I graduated in 2020 with a 2.8 GPA in math and physics (3.1 or 3.2 pre-Covid, I nearly didn't graduate). I've been in working as a data analyst for just under a year and I'm considering going back to grad school. I'm thinking about applying for programs in 2023.

I'm interested in PhD programs, specifically applied statistics or statistical ML. What would be the best way to bolster my application? Retaking courses? Taking some grad-level courses? Participating in research or even finding a job in research? Am I ""doomed"" to apply to MS programs first, then reapply to PhD programs after?

I have a couple of C's in core courses. I have one publication from my time in undergrad and I'm hoping I can write a compelling personal statement to help my case as well (COVID, undiagnosed/untreated mental illness/ADHD, first-gen student). What's the best way to approach going back to grad school?"

1570,datascience,Advice on Project -- Masking Personally Identifiable Information in a large number of files,"&amp;#x200B;

I  have a consulting practice where I evaluate educational programs.  In those programs, participants are identified in fairly regular ways with personally identifiable information (PII) (first and last name, email, address, title, and certain industry standard numerical identifiers).  For most of the time of my practice, the data has been kept internally safe and encrypted.  

My major client asked to share a filespace in the last year, and we're using DropBox Pro to do that.   He's become concerned that DropBox could be hacked and personally identifiable information (PII) could get disclosed.   My first choice in how deal with this would be to go through the files (mostly CSV, some Excel) and look for fields I know have PII in them.  This is pretty doable in theory, as I've controlled the naming standards.  The problem is that it's a LOT of files, probably several hundred.    I'd then like to modify the PII in some way to obfuscate it, without destroying the usefulness of it.  (Some simple solution like UUENCODING the data would be strong enough for me, I don't think strong crypto is necessary.)  It would be desirable for the data to be encoded in a unique way (so if ""Joe Smith"" in one file hashes to a particular key, it should do that in another file so I join the data).

I can write code to do this (R is what I usually use for these projects) in a variety of language, although it's in Windows, so my ability to use scripting languages is limited.

Specifically, does anyone know R modules for uuencoding data with a key, or know of any packages or tools that would be useful in this project?  I suppose a variant would be to strongly encrypt data directories of everything over a year old, which I don't use much, and just do things the ""right"" way going forward."
1571,datascience,Joining firm - company culture concern,"Hey all, I am hoping some of you can help me with a potentially sensitive question.

I am in the late stages of interviews at a firm for an analytics manager position (I know it's not true data science but it's close). It would involve a small number of direct reports.

It's a large (Fortune 500) based in the SE US. I'm not natively an American but I tend to pass for one. I've noticed that all, and I mean literally all, of the folks I have met in my interviews (up, down, and lateral) in the analytics/data teams are all eastern Asian or Indian.

I don't care about working with different cultures but it seemed a flag to me that there are no Americans there. Should that concern me that working conditions are poor (i.e. Americans would leave under those conditions)?

Or is that typical in expanding analytics/data science teams at this point?"
1572,datascience,Should I stick working with a data scientist who doesn't know how to manage DS projects or move to data engineering where there is clarity on next step and project plans.,"So, I have been working in a company for a while on in it's graduate program. Worked on different projects with ETL, and BI dashboards.

Now, I started working with the Data Science team and it's just me and the lead guy. And he doesn't know what we are looking for or planning for the data science team. He leaves me in this zone where I have prove myself and pull a unicorn out of my ass. Honestly it's frustrating just trying work with the guy. And projects are all on PoC phase where it doesn't make sense anymore. I don't even see a clear future for this team because of the type of work the company does. 

The main boss sees it a different way though. He understands that data science is a never ending project and requires alot of research. Like he truly believes there is potential to change and he is focusing on the long game.

However, the data engineering team has plans and pipelines. There is alot more I can learn in terms of technology. The Data Engineering lead is a nice bloke compared to the data science lead. 

If I were to consider my mental health as well, I would move to data engineering because it would be alot more streamlined instead of the BS I'm facing with the current lead. 

If I stick to the long game, probably gonna be frustrating dealing with this DS lead who doesn't have a pipeline and I might just not want to work in the field anymore. Like as much as I like to be a ""data scientist"", the way the other dude operates makes me go ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 


So, tell me folks for r/datascience 
Should I move to data engineering or stick to this data science. 

Or should I have a bit of both like 50/50?

Or 70/30 where data science isnt my main role but work in data engineering rather while spending some time in data science. ?"

1574,datascience,Developed an open source ML software which predicts results from NBA games. Looking for contributors :)," 

Hi everyone :)

As the title says, I've been working on an open source project which aims at predicting the outcome of NBA matches. In its current version, the software (100% written in python):

* Scrapes a website ([https://www.basketball-reference.com/](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)) for new data at fixed times;
* Features 4 models:  

   * Random Forest
   * Decision Tree
   * Ada Boost
   * Elo
* Provides a way to backtest each model;
* Allows Telegram integration (you get a notification on profitable matches directly on Telegram);
* (*in progress*) Contacts the bookmaker of choice to get the odds for a particular match.

# Does it work?

By testing the models on the past NBA season, the accuracy of the them are close to 64%.

# What I am looking for

I am looking for passionate people to contribute to the software, most importantly by improving the models. In my deepest dreams, I would like to reach an accuracy of \~70%.

Please note that I am not a software engineer, and despite the code works, that might not be the best code you have ever seen. For this reason, any comments/suggestions are very much appreciated.

# I am interested, how can I contribute?

1591,datascience,Toward Knowledge Discovery Framework for Data Science Job Market in the United States,"&amp;#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/14i1fen97g871.gif

 

## Toward Knowledge Discovery Framework for Data Science Job Market in the United States

The growth of the data science field requires better tools to understand such a fast-paced growing domain. Moreover, individuals from different backgrounds became interested in following a career as data scientists. Therefore, providing a quantitative guide for individuals and organizations to understand the skills required in the job market would be crucial. This paper introduces a framework to analyze the job market for data science-related jobs within the US while providing an interface to access insights in this market. The proposed framework includes three sub-modules allowing continuous data collection, information extraction, and a web-based dashboard visualization to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of data science-related jobs and skills. The result of this work shows important skills for the main branches of data science jobs and attempts to provide a skill-based definition of these data science branches. The current version of this application is deployed on the web and allows individuals and institutes to investigate skills required for data science positions through the industry lens.

## Method

### Overview of data science skill tracking system

The figure shows an overview of the proposed system. Each of these modules will be described in more detail in the following. As it can be seen in this Figure, this system heavily relies on cloud computing structures that provide stable facilities for continuous tasks with scheduling to collect, analyze, and present its findings dynamically.

&amp;#x200B;

### Data Collection Sample

This shows samples of the returned fields for queries on data analysts. For a framework like the one presented, it is not feasible to use a local machine for data collection as it requires to work continuously for a long period of time with no interruptions (such as internet disconnection or power outage, etc.). Such a machine and maintaining its connectivity would cause a lot of hassle and scrapy cloud services solve this problem by understanding the data collection framework. It allows to create periodic jobs to continuously collect the data using this platform. This module runs its data collection spiders every week and samples job postings on the web periodically. The results of these queries are then delivered into a mysql database on Amazon web services (AWS) for further processing that will be explained in the next section.

&amp;#x200B;

### Interaction graph of visualization components

The effect and interactions between these components are complex. Figure shows these interactions in our dash model. As it can be seen the spatial and temporal aspect of skills could be investigated by using these components. Other components would be added as the work continues.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6kqodcfn7g871.png?width=891&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=66d03e66d4eb226f2dd6323aebc124bcb5ff6758

### Top 20 results based on no. job by states and company

This Table shows the top 20 companies during this period. Despite the expectation that tech sector dominate the field, it appears that other sectors contribute to this market significantly. Namely, consultant and advisory section (e.g. Booz Allen, Deloitte)and financial institutes(e.g JPMorgan, Wells Fargo) and government organization contribute significantly to this market along with the tech sector.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p85utw8o7g871.png?width=787&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e95b15d43045b194660983296a6f092e4433d308

### Top skills for the three main tracks

This Table shows the top 20 skills in each job posting category. The result in this table clearly shows the difference between these main tracks of data science. While machine learning engineer job postings mostly shows a domination of skills such as programming, machine learning, cloud, and big data technologies, a data analyst mostly needs skills for data retrieving (e.g. SQL, Excel,database), and Visualization (e.g Tableau, Power BI).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/434pusrp7g871.png?width=971&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef20eeac233a97c50544d1b6f575a8d4480dc173

### Temporal insights of data science skills

Left Figure shows this comparison between top programming languages mentioned during this period.As it can be seen, the top language is python following by R and Java. This indicated not only python is the most dominant language but the trend and the gap shows it appears to be in demand in future in comparison to others. Similarly, a comparison between deep learning framework is presented in right Figure. The result shows that tensorflow followed by pytorch are the most mentioned deep learning frameworks. Also H2O\~(an R based package) is mentioned much less which indicates the overwhelming attention to python for deep learning. As it can be seen, the framework allows temporal insights to this job market and based on their general importance, such insights can be added to the interface designed for users.

&amp;#x200B;

## Conclusion

This paper introduces a framework capable of collecting and analysing of spatial and temporal aspects of data science's job market using available tools within data science toolbox. The framework provides a free front-end interface developed using plotly dash for this market. The result provides a quantitative guide for individuals and organizations to recognize the most important skills and concepts in this domain based on industry perception. Possible extension to the work here includes sector analysis of job posting and improving on skill extraction technique. Other temporal insights will be added to the interface based on the importance of the information they can add for individuals using this interface.

1594,datascience,Scratch ideas for a project (Stock seasonality patterns),"Hello, As a newbie, I want to get some honest opinions if my ideas are worth digging in.So baseline, I would like to find matching patterns of seasonalities on the historical price of stocks with other seasonalities from commodities, index, international index, ETF, crypto, and bonds.

Let me choose Tesla(TSLA) from S&amp;P 500 for my sample. Mainly TSLA's revenue comes from Electric Vehicles(EV). From this point, I could guess that TSLA will have very similar seasonalities with other EV-related stocks and commodities.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c7aswnhnlg871.png?width=984&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=32e8f9261a538364923acbb005955a2a5b7b9dba

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my manual chart comparison (one year)Stocks are TSLA(EV maker), NIO (Chinese EV maker), BLNK (EV charging station), VWAGY(German carmaker), FORD (Carmaker). From this, I could see orange(BLNK) and blue(NIO) have similar seasonality. Grey(TSLA) seems to have some correlation both with orange and blue. Purple(VWAGY) and Green(FORD) have an overlapping moment for a month.

Additionally, I would like to check correlating seasonality of stock with other data like commodities, international stock index, and other significant indexes. For example, for TSLA, I can expect it might have a correlation with the semiconductor index (Ongoing shortage issues) or EV battery commodities(Cobalt, Lithium, Nickel) index. There is a strong chance of correlation between TSLA and some Chinese economy indexes since TSLA is investing tons of money into the Chinese market. Possible correlation with the price of crypto, since Elon was pumping Bitcoin and Dogecoin for months.

With this background, I would like to build a model that could calculate correlating indexes and stocks.

I think this model has an easier validation process since we can prove the test result with business rules in the real world.

If this scratch idea works, I believe it can help to understand the fundamental of the stock. Without research on the stock(Like I did for TSLA and EVs), this model might quickly reveal the characteristics of products or businesses just by analyzing which index has the strongest correlation.

This is a very scratch idea, and I am not sure about methodology as well. I have used the basic Ljung-box model for similar school work. I would like to get some advice if I am talking about something really non-sense.

1597,datascience,[Asking for advice] Reaching out to my former supervisor boss for 100% work remote," Need help in terms of reaching out to my former supervisor boss.

I've been working in a company (it is divided into two groups, company A &amp; B) for two years and now the company splits up.

I am mainly working as a BI data analyst and a lot of my clients are company B. Company B is Sweden-based, company A is American-based. For some reason, I found that I am more connected with the team and the people more in Company B (and lots of clients in company B seem to like me too).

My boss lets call him Bob (from company A), and his boss (let's call him Josh, someone from company B) offered a 100% working remote position before last year, which is the same position (BI data Analyst) Honestly, I don't like working for Bob very much, he wants me to create a prediction model but pay me as a BI analyst.

I rejected it because:

1. Bob seems to want to take advantage of this opportunity to write a new job responsibility to HR which will involve a more advanced analytic (create prediction model, etc) which I am not comfortable with.
2. I have to follow their time zone (12 hours difference)
3. Either way, at that time, I'd still have to report to Bob

If I knew that the company will be splitting, I would not think twice to take the opportunity because I won't be working for Bob. I believe the time zone can be negotiable.

But when I told Bob, I only mention reason # 2 because I was not comfortable telling #1, #3, and #4.

And then they found someone, which is pretty much a BI analyst too, someone who is less experienced than me and no experience in creating predictions whatsoever.

I am wondering if emailing Josh (my ex-boss) would be a good idea - expressing my interest to join his team and what would be the best way to approach this. I heard from their team, they might hire someone in Feb next year.

I'd love to be 100% remote and have a chance to work temporarily in Sweden someday. My current working arrangement is still not clear, I have expressed interest in 100% remote many times, and my boss is still being vague about it.

Thank you, guys!"

1601,datascience,Should you mention adhoc tasks in your resume?,"Hello!

As someone who is a beginner with just 1 year of experience, there's not a lot of big projects under my belt. And I was thinking of adding some adhoc tasks in my resume. For example: My manager would tell me to analyze why this week's cycle time for a factory increased. So I'll get the data from the sql database and then use Python or R to go deeper and see what type of manufacturing parts caused the increase in cycle time and then give the results to my manager. He'll then ask the factories to focus on those manufacturing parts next time more. (Oversimplifying a lot of stuff)

These are kind of important stuff but I'm not sure if I should mention this on my resume since these are mostly adhoc basis.

Please let me know if you guys mention such tasks on your resume or if you used to as a junior. More importantly, how to write those.

Thanks!"

1612,datascience,Observational study with varying amount of treatment,"Hi folks,
I work in a company where we provide service to employees of a different company (benefits space), so we get data for all the employees and a particular employee can engage with us whenever they desire. So over an year we can have impact period from anywhere from 1 to 12 months as they can engage any time. 

So, now my task is to come with ways to show that engaging with us causes positive effects in employees key performance metrics like for example increase in credit score. And we get that data for all the users through out the year so I can easily compute deltas and trends for a user between two dates. 

 To do so I can think of these techniques 
 - Just comparing non-engaged and engaged population and aggregate their deltas from start of the year and engagement date respectively. Issues : varying amount of window sizes
- compare deltas after constant x months windows for each client from same starting points like above, and then compare and contrast. Issues : windows can be affected by temporal effects
- select engaged users which engaged at particular y month and non-engaged users, now do method 1 for just that set of users but starting the window at that y month. Issue - lose data, we have lower engagement numbers 

Is there any other way that can be used to compare and contrast. Once I can two subsets like that I can start doing some causal analysis on it. Thanks!"

1617,datascience,Data Analast Newbie Blues,"Hello world!

I am almost 6 months into my first data analyst role. I got my MBA and graduated in Jan 2020 (ha ha!). I spent all of 2020 unemployed and struggling to get my house in order. I started a 6-month data analyst bootcamp that I haven't finished as I finally got a role 2 months in as a Business Analyst. I'm using SQL and Tableau and I thought I was much better at both things than I was but not on purpose. I am trying to learn so much at once and I need a lot more support than I have at my role. I feel like an idiot. The first 3 months I was having endless panic attacks (I think \*maybe\* COVID affected me...). 

I am trying really hard to put in my 8 hours or more day (maybe more like 9/9.5 hours). I'm going a bit crazy. I'm not really socializing and I haven't really had time to exercise and I feel sluggish, grouchy, and my back hurts a lot. I am wiped. I try to balance some socializing/rest on the weekends and a hard stop day-to-day. I have a few books I am reading and I try to practice SQL here and there. I spend most of my time lately in Tableau learning how to build out the views I need and learning the fine particulars there. It's very challenging but interesting. I don't know if I'm naturally good at anything (is talent a myth? Can it all be honed through practice?) but I am interested in the data process and part of a business. 

When I've asked my boss for help, he's gotten irritated and said that he can't be the person to help me, I can't make him be my bottleneck. Me saying I just need more time, guidance, and practice that I'm too junior. It feels like it's my fault for resources being what they are. Give a guy a chance!

I guess I feel lost like how does anyone actually learn and practice these skills? When does a data newb get that chance to start the practice? I see these skills as a life-long practice. I truly believe that is the only way I can build the nuances and understanding through that time, that trial and error. Am I wrong? I don't believe there is any way around the time and practice and dedication it takes to deepen these skillsets.  

My boss' expectations are not at all in line with having hired a junior person. I live in SF and it feels like everyone needs to be a near-professional in every facet of their lives. It feels like he expects me to be a semi-professional visual designer, a statistician, SQL expert, Tableau Zen Master. 

I feel like he's going to try to move me off his team before I hit my year mark and I am trying to focus on what I'm building for myself, and showing up and putting in the time and learning how to keep refining and reinforcing my own learning. 

Buuut I am not producing fast enough for my boss but I think the problem is he has a comp sci background and I don't and so he gets mad that I can't do what he does, and he's actually said that. It just feels shitty and lonely. I am so wiped out day-to-day and. I feel pretty worthless. It's a company where people give lots of shot outs and I'm the only analyst who hasn't gotten any. Overall, I like my coworkers but I don't love the company so I know the company will never love me so in that way, I can give myself some emotional distance. The company will be fine without me, so I gotta take care of myself. 

I just feel like a dumb old dummy and I can't win for trying. Some days I can focus on what I'm building and the long-term game and other days, like today, I am definitely sitting in a pity party of one. I'm tired and worn down.  

I worry I'm an idiot and I can't learn this stuff (so much initial imposter syndrome and crying when I first started this role and it's getting better and surely I can only keep improving). 

I feel like I'm being shamed for needing help at all?/needing as much help as I do? I am trying to be gentle with myself that I'm really pushing myself well beyond my comfort zone. This is a career switch for me and I think I'd like to take this data role and pivot to a program manager or something. If nothing else, I'll have this 6 + months under my belt. 

I am not really producing a lot of work but I am learning a fuck ton and I know that is very valuable for moving forward. I just feel inadequate and part of trying to support myself is making use of these sorts of forums (Reddit for this sort of emotional storytelling, Tableau forum for all the weird and endless questions I have with tableau, and Stack Exchange). 

All tips, tricks, support, constructive criticism welcome. I especially love hearing about books and resources.

1623,datascience,Data science after MBA?,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post here, you guys have given some great advice and I'm hoping to benefit from your knowledge.

I'm currently working at one of the FAANG as a Program Manager (after completing my MBA 3 years ago, STEM undergrad+master's) and I'm currently at a career crossroads. I worked on a predictive model for my master's thesis (which I published a paper on) and since then have had a keen interest in quant. I love writing SQL, analysing data and creating dashboards, and taught myself basic python+R and some ML algorithms during 2020. I've also done a fair bit of marketing analytics (segmentation, conversion, attribution etc) in my current role. However, in my current job I don't get to do this as much as I'd like, and I'm starting to realize that I don't get a lot of motivation out of rising up the corporate ladder, and what I do like is working on mathematical problems with real world implications. While some of these problems are more systemic to where I work, I am contemplating a change in my career trajectory.

I haven't heard of a lot of MBAs moving into technical work, and would love to hear from people who were in similar situations and made a pivot. If I was to look for data science roles, do you think my background and lack of pure DS work would play against me? Should I go back to school or find DS roles with my current employer?"
1624,datascience,How Common are Side Hustles?,"Just wondering who has a side hustle along with their other 9-5?

I'm debating taking a second job along side my other 9-5 and would like to hear if its being done by others.  The side gig would be along the lines of about 10 hours a week and about %70 less in $/hr at a chem/bioinformatics startup.  I did an internship with this company during my masters and really like the folks who work there.  I'm a recent MS Bioinformatics graduate employed full time at a large company scripting dashboards and buying software for the R&amp;D department.  No real qualms with the 9-5 outside of it being bad for my chances of getting another legit data science or bioinformatics job elsewhere.

Benefits of side gig:  
More interesting work (by a lot as it will be mostly novel research)  
Money (9-5 salary + side gig)  
Network (rubbing shoulders with some folks who are a big deal in the chem/bioinformatics field)  
Boost to CV

Downsides:  
Effect other employment (I work from home and would keep meticulous track of hours)  
Time away from family and other hobbies (This is really one of the big ones as I'd be basically signing up for 50+ hour weeks)

I only hope to do this for at most 1 year and then either have made a place to go full time at the startup or have built my CV enough to work somewhere else."

Bottom line is, I live in a toxic household and am 2 years into my out-of-state undergraduate degree. My parents refuse to support me living on my own, even if I was paying for my own housing. I cannot get housing without proof of sustainable income or a cosigner. I cannot get a private loan without a cosigner. I would be screwed financially. 

I spent years working in service jobs and have had enough. Having a skilled job with a higher pay rate would make it easier to afford paying out-of-state and balance my work with school, since I could work less at a higher wage. Additionally, that second year of mine would be 1/4 of the cost since my work would enable me to show proof of residency, thus granting me in-state school costs.   

However, like I said, it doesn't seem possible for me to get a job in data science while still in school.

1645,datascience,Data Science in Marketing: Demand Forecasts vs. Media Mix Models?,"Hi there,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm looking to hear from other data scientists in the marketing field, especially if you have worked on a demand forecasting model, a media mix model, or both.

&amp;#x200B;

Media mix models are meant to determine the effect of ad spend on sales - giving evidence for the causality from observational data by controlling for factors such as seasonality, promotions/discounts, competitor activity, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand - demand forecasting models, particularly for companies who sell a physical product, are meant to best predict what the unit sales will be for a given future time point in order to plan for production and help the supply chain folks out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been wondering a lot - are there any of you out there who have seen these two functions combined into one model? I.e. a ""sales"" forecasting model that seeks to accurately predict unit sales while giving a good estimate on the causal effect of ad spend? It seems like these are usually two different functions in a marketing team. The best explanation I can think of is that MMM usually uses very interpretable models (e.g. GLM) because the desired output is an effect size while sales forecasting is often achieved with more flexible models (like LSTM networks)."

So, my question to working data scientists: what amount of math/stats are you actually using at your job? My assumption was that DS is 90% data gathering/cleaning and 10% actual modeling.

1654,datascience,Is a MS in Data Science worth the time and student loans it would take to get it?,"Hey guys! I'm considering getting my MS in Data Science but I'm not entirely sure if it's worth the time and loans if I can advance just as far in my career by teaching myself the same skills using cheap and/or free resources like Microsoft certifications, classes on Udsmy and whatnot. 

Currently I am contracted as a Data Scientist on a Microsoft project (can't say a whole lot about it due to my NDA). I've been at this job for about 14 months now. Prior to this I have no formal Data Science experience other than making my own minor analysis projects at my previous job such as using Excel to track employees hours worked and graph the data to see if we need to hire more people. 

I also have a Bachelor's in Sociology and I am a certified Microsoft Azure Data Science Associate (passed the DP-100 exam). I am currently working on a Microsoft cert for Power BI (the DA-100) and working to improve my Python skills on codeacademy.com. I knew some python going in to this job and have learned some since but I am definitely nowhere near an expert. My skills probably land somewhere between beginner and intermediate.

I'm wondering, will a MS get me further than just picking up more self taught skills and completely online certifications in them? I'm curious what those those who have a MS or don't but have been in the field longer than me think about this."

**Data analyst pros**
* Pays a lot (&gt;20%)  more than the other role - important because I'm considering buying my own home
* Easy government job so I can be doing a Master's on the side, which I think my career could benefit from
**Data analyst cons**
* It's more of a data engineering role, building/maintaining pipelines etc. Analysis will be minimum. DS will be presumably zero. 
* Apparently non-technical management - it was an easy, very high level interview
* Completely new team (they are hiring 30+ people). Along with the easy interview, I think this means that the quality of the team might not be great.


**Jr Data Scientist pros**
* It's Data Science!! Work sounds interesting and challenging 
* Manager seems like he knows a lot
**Jr Data Scientist cons**
* Work hours will be long (9hr days at least)
* Glassdoor.com puts this company at 3.4 stars due to poor upper management and a revolving door of hires
* I'll be earning a lot less :("

To you, what makes a good DS Masters?","I am asking this because I have been accepted onto a Masters in Data &amp; Computational Science and some of the negativity (whether founded or unfounded, I am not qualified to say) about DS Masters on this subreddit has my doubting whether I should do it or go in a different direction. I have seen some courses which are undoubtedly a cash-grab for this currently ""hot"" area. 

Like I said, I don't have the education or experience in this area to give an expert answer. I do come from a CS background, another ""hot"" field. For my money, a good program is one that teaches you the always-present fundamentals: maths, stats etc in this case rather than ultimately temporary technologies/trends (even if they are in demand right now). Like in CS, you teach fundamentals and paradigms rather than just a module on Python, a module on Java, a module on new programming language XYZ which may be obsolete in a few years. 

I think (and hope) my potential program ([https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W\_HU\_MENU.P\_PUBLISH?p\_tag=PROG&amp;MAJR=T306](https://sisweb.ucd.ie/usis/!W_HU_MENU.P_PUBLISH?p_tag=PROG&amp;MAJR=T306)) looks worthwhile. The program is offered by the school of mathematics and statistics and most of the modules are shared with the MSc in Statistics that the school offers, the other modules are from ""normal"" maths e.g. applied matrix theory and from computational science. 

This is my two cents anyway. But yeah, what makes a good DS masters to you?"

I just moved from Python to SAS for 4 months due to new job requirements. I wonder how you think SAS compared with other languages, any future.

Mine:

\- SAS is not so complex. The only problem is we have to memorize weird syntax

\- Lots of problem can be solved with proc sql. Unfortunately, proc sql has some different characteristics compared with standard SQL (e.g. why row\_number is missing in proc sql????). I likely use SAS mainly for practicing SQL.

\- The syntax is unique and not transferrable. If you're in SAS industry for too long, then it's likely hard to move to other jobs with different tool. Unlike if you know MATLAB or Python, you can easily move to R, or even C/C++ (They're interconnected with each other very well, SAS is a standalone hero)

\- Company uses SAS likely for security purposes (need an organization who is responsible for the tool if anything bad happened)

\- Then SAS Visual Analytics is another story and if you program for Advanced Filter in SAS Viya, then again it's more or less different systax compared with SAS Guide.

1721,datascience,Data Manipulation layer - where?,"Hello hello - After months of reading posts, blogs, watching youtube videos, etc... I am still wondering where do people do the data manipulation in their data stack. I know it depends on what are your goals, the overall data stack and so on. However, how do you guys solve the issue of manipulating the data before analysis?

  
My typical example is: Data source: company DB (a copy created for data team) - Output: Dashaboard in BI tool - Data manipulation needed: cleaning, formatting, calculated fields, etc...  


At the moment we are doing everything in our BI tool, and it is fine. However, we have some limitations, since we can't use python in it and also, we are creating a lot of similar calculated tables in it (fortunately there is the possibility of query what has been imported from DB to build new tables inside the BI tool).  


I guess that the answer to this is probably to set up a data warehouse, but even in this case, where do you do manipulate data? Do you create a table in the DWH each time you want a new analysis?

1724,datascience,Introducing Hyperlib: Simple Deep learning in Hyperbolic space," Hi all! I've just released a new open-source python library that makes it easy to create the next generation of neural networks in the Hyperbolic space (as opposed to Euclidean). We're calling it [Hyperlib](https://pypi.org/project/hyperlib/).

The Hyperbolic space is different from the Euclidean space - It has more capacity which means it can fit a wider range of data. Hyperbolic geometry is particularly suited to embedding data that has an underlying hierarchical structure. There‚Äôs also a growing amount of research documenting the benefits of modelling the brain using Hyperbolic over Euclidean geometry.

We found that existing Hyperbolic implementations were less ready to be applied to real-world problems. Hyperlib solves that, abstracting away all of the complicated maths and making Hyperbolic networks as easy as a pip install. We hope it will inspire more research into the real-world benefits of non-Euclidean deep learning.

You can install Hyperlib using:

`pip install hyperlib`

We‚Äôve also written a blog post explaining the benefits of hyperbolic networks and how to use the package [here](https://www.nalex.ai/post/hyperlib-deep-learning-in-the-hyperbolic-space)."

For example, if I had a 5D array, that was filled with 1's, but with 2 separate areas filled with 100's, how can I find and draw boundary boxes around them?

I'm really open to any idea. So far I'm using image filters for the 2D examples, but for the N-dim case I'm not sure how well this will apply?

However, after I've worked on those projects, I feel like knowing or not knowing stats doesn't really affect my ability to complete the projects. I'm still able to analyze the data well, gather actionable insights and build models around those insights to optimize processes.

For example, linear regression is constrained by its assumptions, so what? We want stationary time-series data for ARIMA-based models so sample statistics are not time-dependent, so what? Bayesian methods like MCMC allow us to sample a distribution similar to the actual distribution due to the law of large numbers, so what?

Don't get me wrong, I really like learning about statistics as it fills me with a wondrous sense of appreciation every time I understand the underlying reasons behind why certain models work. But I'm just really curious as to why statistical knowledge is so valued in this field when (based on my personal experience) it doesn't really affect the quality of your work as long as you know WHEN and HOW to use statistical tools/models (even if you don't know WHY)."

1742,datascience,Data streaming question,"Hey, I'm looking for a solution, open source docker deployable service.

What I need to do is stream data from several mysql db's to a central postgres db. Polling once every 30-min. So performance and query size should matter. 

Some of the tables in the mysql db do not have a date on them.

Now initially I planned to join the 6 tables in one of the db's to make a view of 130 columns, in order to get the date data in. Then SELECT * FROM table WHERE date=last 1 day. This should give me an option to limit the query by filtering it. 

One can quickly see how the massive view will lag the origin server, especially if I poll it every 30 mins. There are plenty of NULL values in there but that's beside the point. Its the best solution I can think of at the moment. Correct me if I'm wrong about the filtering performance and if its actually sensible. 

Alternatively I can stream individual tables but as mentioned above, there isn't any date column to filter, so it'd cause even more of a performance bottleneck to select all rows for each table at every update. 

I initially used airflow to achieve this, by writing the data to a csv as a staging area for loading on to pg.

I've also looked at airbyte but they seem to be pretty early stage, though correct me if I'm wrong.

Could be difficult to use a mysql slave db as the two db's are different types. I also don't think there's probably sufficient infrastructure currently to handle several additional slave db's.

1754,datascience,Data Science Grad School Question,[removed]
1755,datascience,Why gatekeep? (and the reason why it won't work!),"Whenever I hear someone saying, ""to be a real data scientist, you need to know X,"" I cringe. In most cases, that's not useful: data scientists do different things and use various tools in different companies. There's no point in saying that you need to know X, Y, or Z. Learn the tool that gets the job done, whichever that is.

Though, I've often wondered why this kind of gatekeeping is so frequent in our industry. After thinking about it for a while, I came to the following conclusion: for well-paid professions, there's an inverse relationship between barriers to entry and the amount of gatekeeping.

For example, take the healthcare industry. This industry is heavily regulated, so there are high barriers to entry: you cannot go around calling yourself a medical doctor; you need to get a specific degree for that. Which makes sense: you don't want to put your life in the hands of someone you don't know can tell the difference between a heart attack and a headache.

On the other spectrum, you have the technological industry. In it, there are fewer regulations: you don't need a specific degree or permission to be part of it. So, you'll find a broader range of professions in its participants. It's not rare to find a programmer whose background is in arts or humanities. This industry has low barriers to entry.

For people outside of these industries, low and high barriers to entry create different incentives. In tech, there's little risk in saying you're a software engineer without having the required knowledge. You might be kicked out of a company, or get a bad reputation. In healthcare, if you fake your credentials, you might end up in prison.

Because of this fact, people in these industries behave differently.

My wife is a medical doctor, so I get to hang around many people from healthcare. I've never heard anyone in that area say ""if you don't know X, then you are not a real medical doctor."" They don't seem to worry too much about that. They know there's no shortcut to practice medicine. You need to get a degree and pass the required exams.

I work as a data scientist, so I also get to spent time with a few techies. Opposite to healthcare, in tech, I often see people talking about what a real data scientist/software engineer/data engineer should know.

I believe many people in tech behave this way to protect their current status. Well-paid jobs provide you with a high social standing and a good salary. If you see any of those at risk, you look for ways to mitigate those risks.

There's no problem in industries with high barriers to entry: outsiders won't try very hard to get into it. Hardly anyone quits their job, studies for six years, and then becomes a medical doctor. But, if you combine low barriers to entry with well-paid jobs, then people will come running at it like if they were escaping from an army of zombies. It's no by chance that new boot camps pop up every day.

That's where gatekeepers enter the game. They have one goal: keep their salaries and status high. How do they do it? They create artificial barriers to entry by making what they do look harder than it really is.

But don't get me wrong, I'm not stating that that's an evil goal. It makes total sense. I'm yet to see someone fighting for a lower salary or a decrease in their social standing!

I just question the means. Will gatekeeping really make sure you keep a good salary and high social standing?

I bet it won't. In the last twenty years, we've seen three things increase quickly:

* People working remotely
* Free or low-cost access to high-quality education
* Democratization of technology

So there are way too many people living in cheaper areas wanting to get a higher paying job that will have access to more affordable and better education and can access the same technology you can. If this continues, whatever attempt people put into creating artificial barriers will fall short.

So, don't gatekeep. It won't work."
1756,datascience,Advise on how to proceed towards a data science career path,"Hello all,

I was wondering if I could pick you guys' brain regarding getting into a data science career path. I am a CS degree holder currently working as an administrative assistant at an international organization. I am one of those whose been in the US under a nonimmigrant visa, which allowed me to go to a US university while working as an administrative assistant (not the same organization, mind you). This also means that I wasn't able to qualify for OPT. So I graduated with a CS degree with 3+ years of admin experience and needing an H1B, which made it very difficult to get a job in the field.

Fast forward to now, I was blessed enough to have a manager who would like to utilize my CS background whilst being an assistant. During our recent check-in, she mentioned something about data science and how much it is in demand within our organization. She said that I should look into it as it could be a path for me to jump to a ""different ladder"". This made me very interested in data science as I really want as I feel like this is my opportunity to finally utilize my degree...but unfortunately, I don't know where to start. 

Currently, I am taking some online training for Stata, which is a program that we are using for a project I am involved with with her and other people. We have a research assistant within the team that takes care of the data, but I want to be able to step up and act as a back-up in case she isn't able to take care of the data. Also, I am set for a couple of online training for Python and R. Is this too much? I guess in my attempt to look like I am interested, I am trying to do everything. I also looked into the Data Science Specialization through Coursera, but wondered also if that's worth it or too much...I don't know, I would just hate learning something and not being able to use it -- just like my CS degree.

1773,datascience,What is your preferred workflow for working with documents and code at the same time?,"I assume at least 70% will say Jupyter, probably mostly with Python, maybe a few with Julia. Another 20% will say R with RStudio, etc. A handful might say Spyder or something.

I just want to say that I've found nearly every stack, at least as a beginner looking to 'get started fast', is horribly convoluted. I say that as a software developer who writes JavaScript applications (a well-known convoluted platform).

I just want to find something as simple as basic markdown that also lets me execute code, and it doesn't require a special IDE or a command for the code to run (ie, it continuously runs, or it creates live updates on changes). 

- I really like the R Markdown format, but I don't love R itself, and I hate having to use R Studio.
- I like Python more as a data science language, and it's cleanliness as a language also has a similar philosophy as markdown, but there doesn't seem to be a document format that I like. I don't want to write in cells (a la Jupyter) or use an IDE that controls where my cursor can go. I want to edit raw code.
- I even looked into writing code in JavaScript. Yes, Javascript math is UGLY, but I thought oh well, at least I can easily write documents and upload it to the internet, if that is my goal. I tried MDX engines, and you can't even write JS in MDX. At most, you can write a component in a separate file and import it into the MDX file, which is super bloaty.

So, what are your thoughts on this?

Is there any stack that has:

1. Markdown as a base document (not cells)
2. uses a decent high level language (I'm pretty flexible) that can be executed within the document and ideally create visuals too
3. no major requirements on IDE (I am a big time VS Code user, and I don't want to change my IDE just to write a little math)"

1775,datascience,Presenting to Management,"I wonder if you could share your experiences. I have to present some findings to a Management team that is not very technical, which I have not seen nor spoken with - the corporate office is in a different state.

**Context:** I'm doing a side gig, where I was handed over a bunch of data in order to see if there is anything interesting, well I have found a few things (most of it just validating previously held assumptions by the org) and I need to present the findings in a PPT, chances are there will be **no live presentation**, so it's more of a document where the audience will not be well-versed in statistics. 
 
Usually when doing an analysis, I tend to have a better formulated problem statement, some pre-existing hypotheses, present the findings to domain experts with a bunch of graphs, have a discussion, refine the analysis, repeat.

In this case the hypotheses came about only after I collected the data and often times after inspecting some correlations, validating with a few domain experts. It's a correlational analysis, but I have a VERY STRONG feeling that the management team (the final stakeholders for the report) will expect/assume causality.

First question:
 * How do you communicate to stakeholders that the analysis does not infer causality? My concern is that if I have a statement like that somewhere in the beginning, most will skip it and just jump straight into **the good stuff**.
 * What are you experiences/best practices when presenting to management?
 

My initial presentation was rather technical, e.g. **""Relationship between Variable X and Y""**, a bunch of slides with various graphs and correlations, *with p values and shit* :), more going through what was done and outcome, rather than **""Variable X and Y Display a Strong Relationship** or **Variable X displays a stronger impact on Variable Y than Variable Z""**, I was asked to tone it down and do the latter  - a more of **management consultant type presentation**. 

Second Question:
 * Have you done something like this? Presenting in a Management Consultant type presentation? Was the final result any good? Any suggestions?
 * Maybe you have a template or some other material to help you structure your work?
 
I was asked to have more Action Statement type Titles with supporting graphs, but as it's a correlational analysis, I don't feel I can make any **BOLD** statements about anything, there's a lot of assumptions and nuance, the data is noisy, the correlations are weak (but non-zero), the data is **HIGHLY SKEWED**, missing data for some variables (not at random), the target is ordinal. If I were to present it, I could communicate the nuance, like - there seems to be a relationship this type of relationship between these 2 variables, but this particular variable had some missing values, or interpreting Beta coef for a regression with an ordinal target variable (I know it wrong, but it's intuitive :))

Third Questions:
 * Should I go with BOLD sweeping statements?
 * Maybe there should be a qualifying slide following each ""Insight Slide""?

I would be developing a modelling pipeline and would not be saving the serialised model files, so no need of model folder as well. I think you guys know where I am going here.

1786,datascience,Adding an incremental counter based in two groups on a data frame? (R),"Hello everyone!

Background:

I'm analyzing the UCI HAR dataset [link here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).

The dataset consists of multiple x-y-z points of data taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope instruments of a smartphone for 30 different subjects while doing different activities (walking, standing, etc).

My goal:

I'm looking to extract a tidy dataset from that mess and try to get a tableau dashboard or plot.

Obviously, I need to do this in a time series plot since each of these points of data is taken on a set time interval (let's say 1 second).

Unfortunately, tableau won't let me plot this in any way unless I give it a ""time series"" to anchor to the X-axis. 

My idea is to create a new column in this dataset ('time') which increases in value by 1 for each observation on the respective subgroup (Subject ID '1' - Activity 'Walking', etc) 

My current dataset looks something like this:

&amp;#x200B;

|Subject ID|Activity |BodyAcc-X|BodyAcc-Y|BodyAcc-Z|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Walking|0.2|0.2|0.2|
|1|Walking|0.3|0.3|0.3|
|1|Standing|0.5|0.5|0.5|
|1|Standing|0.6|0.6|0.6|
|2|Walking|0.3|0.3|0.3|
|2|Walking|0.2|0.2|0.2|
|2|Standing|0.1|0.1|0.1|
|2|Standing|0.4|0.4|0.4|

My goal is to create something that looks like this so that I can plot it in tableau:

&amp;#x200B;

|Subject ID|Activity |Time|BodyAcc-X|BodyAcc-Y|BodyAcc-Z|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Walking|1|0.2|0.2|0.2|
|1|Walking|2|0.3|0.3|0.3|
|1|Standing|1|0.5|0.5|0.5|
|1|Standing|2|0.6|0.6|0.6|
|2|Walking|1|0.3|0.3|0.3|
|2|Walking|2|0.2|0.2|0.2|
|2|Walking|3|0.2|0.2|3|
|2|Standing|1|0.1|0.1|0.1|
|2|Standing|2|0.4|0.4|0.4|
|2|Standing|3|0.4|0.4|3|
|2|Standing|4|0.4|0.4|0.4|

&amp;#x200B;

I grouped SubjectId and activity, and ordered it respectively, so my dataset looks great, I'm just lacking the time stamp for me to be able to plot it.

I was able to do this but only counting towards either the subject Id, or the activity, but not both.

I want the counter to restart for each subject and activity (I'm not sure how to phrase this, I hope it's clear)

This is my first time posting here and I'm new to R, so if I'm missing anything or if I can improve my question in anyway please let me know,

One year ago I felt a sudden stroke of ‚Äúpurpose in my life‚Äù and was absolutely sure that I need to run big things in this world - I should run my own it-products (or at least help others do that with my analytics skills).
Now, after 1 year on PA position in EdTech company and 3 negative validations of own-startup-ideas I understood one simple, but contradictory thing - IM NOT INTERESTED IN DOING SOMETHING BIG AND MAKING AN IMPACT. All I want is to tackle interesting problems and get paid for doing that. And business/product analysis, which is tied to AARRR processes and metrics, doesn‚Äôt come even close to my definition of ‚Äúinteresting problems‚Äù.

So here comes the hierarchy of job types in DS (depending on level of proximity to business solutions):
1) ml/dl-libraries source code developer
2) model researcher 
3) MLops engineer
4) data scientist (ml-oriented business-guy)
5) data/product/business analyst (customer-behaviour-oriented business guy)

I have absolute no interest to 4,5 jobs. Any interesting things (switch whole company‚Äôs analysis grounds from frequentist to bayesian statistics) sooner or later stops being ‚Äútackling interesting problem‚Äù and becomes ‚Äúexecute routine workflow using existing analytics tools‚Äù.

I also have no interest in 3 job, because of the same reason. You don‚Äôt work for new technologies approaches, you work for solving business requests, and these ones are, actually, not very creative. Designing new architecture seems identical to this ‚Äú frequentist-&gt;bayesian switch‚Äù. Only happens once a few years, and rest of the time you end up doing boring trash.

Is my suggestion right, that switching to ml/dl-libraries developer or model researcher gives more frequent access to interesting and creative tasks? More ‚Äútackling interesting problem‚Äù  and less ‚Äúexecute routine workflow using existing tools‚Äù?"

Hi r/datascience I‚Äôm a second year medical student with about 8 years of coding experience with the last 3 in python but I‚Äôm a little out of practice in my coding and could use some advice/help with the research I‚Äôm doing right now.

I‚Äôm trying to quantify one aspect of the healthcare gap between urban and rural America, specifically access to point of care ultrasound. POC ultrasound is great in the clinical setting and has been shown in previous research to improve primary care outcomes when it is implemented correctly. 

In order to do that, I wanted to identify the percent of clinics in rural areas that have ultrasound access and compare that to the percent of clinics in urban areas that have ultrasound access and then use existing outcome data on rural vs urban health to speculate on the net effect of that percent difference.

I went to \[this gov website\](https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download) which gives me all registered healthcare clinics' names, address, and other extraneous info. I want to use this excel document from the government website to search all the registered healthcare clinic websites and see if they mention the word ultrasound and then classify them as either having ultrasound access or not based on that. This would require web-scraping which I don‚Äôt have any experience in and am thus asking for help and advice on.

I also plan on using existing data on rural and urban counties and just classifying the medical center as rural or urban based on that which should be very easy.

If anyone has any ideas on where I should go for this or if another approach would be more ideal, please let me know. 

Also, because the biggest thing you lack in Medschool is free time to do stuff like this, if anyone would be interested in helping to write this code with or for me **I would put them on the paper as a fellow author.** Publications look really good on grad school apps, residency apps, and probably on job applications as well(not as sure on that one).

Right now it‚Äôs a bit all over the place depending on the data source: BigQuery, PostgreSQL (there are reasons why we have two separate dbs but I won‚Äôt get into that), Google Sheets, csvs, etc. Besides of labeled datasets, we also have many dictionaries that we use to build simple rules. 

The motivation is, each project usually has their own datasets but there have been a lot of cases where we can leverage other project‚Äôs datasets. Currently the only way is to ask the PIC of the project. It doesn‚Äôt seem to be very scalable now especially that we‚Äôre now having more NLP projects and more people working on them.

Right now, as a first step, I‚Äôm thinking to just maintain a list of queries for the ones in db and keep all the docs/csvs in one folder. Although ideally I‚Äôd love to have these datasets easily accessible much like TensorFlow/HuggingFace datasets (not sure if we have the bandwidth to build a GUI to explore the datasets though). 

Have you faced a similar problem? I would like to hear any suggestions or your experience if any, as well as the challenges you encountered. Thanks a lot!"
1836,datascience,Career advice - wanting to know if data science would be a good fit for me,"STEM degree with &gt;200 undergrad credits and &gt;50 graduate credits, no graduate degree. My only programming experience is BASIC from back in the stone age, plus a little Access SQL and a tiny bit of VBA. I find learning programming to be difficult these days at my age (over 50). I'm OK with computers (mainly run Linux). Wouldn't mind learning Python, but don't know where to start.

Problem is, I can't find a job in my field; there just isn't much of anything locally. I've been looking at data science programs online, and I don't even know if that sort of thing would get me a job. I'm good with numbers, have a decent grasp of statistics (although the only course I had is now ~30 years behind me), I like databases- I've only been exposed to Access, by virtue of being unwilling to try other ones, since I only had time to learn Access. I poked around with ""R"" a few years ago, but it was simply too powerful for the trivial amount of work I had to do with it.

I see there's a bunch of [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/subject/data-science) courses, not sure which one to start with.

I'm just kind of lost and concerned I'll get bogged down and quit. Is there a recommended starting place?

Sorry if this sounds stupid, I don't mean for it to come across like ""I want to do data science, but I'm not a programmer and I don't have any statistics beyond what a pocket calculator does, I just want the big bucks jobs."" I'm just overwhelmed and don't know anyone who works as a data scientist to ask them what to do."

1843,datascience,Questions from a Pre-Med Student Transitioning into a Data Science Masters,"Hi everyone! I'm new to this group and am looking for some advice on data science masters programs. 

I majored in Neuroscience for undergrad and took the basic math/stats classes required for med school but have never taken a cs/data sci course or linear alegbra. I really want to pursue a masters degree in data science now because currently my new research position revolves around clinical projects that are more data/bio-statics driven which I found much more interesting and after working in a hospital environment (and a lot of hours doing premed stuff \]: ) I've realized that I don't want to be a physician. 

My most important question is that I know the top **ds master programs all have some type of programming experience requirement for applicants**. To make up for this, I was wondering if I should enroll in a ds bootcamp or should I just take some classes online? I graduated from UC Berkeley and I know that they have a ds bootcamp and cs extension classes so I trying to see what is a good way to knock out those prerequisites.  I hope to be a competitive candidate for the top ms programs and as for research I currently have published a few papers as a contributing author but all in basic life science/clinical (no ds related projects), gpa around 3.4-5.

Also, if you can recommend what are some **top data science MS programs that you had good experiences** with that would be wonderful. I know a lot of premed students in my shoes right now so your advice would be very helpful to us! Thank you so much!"

We are currently looking at Threadripper vs. Epyc. Are there any benchmarks or experiences on how these two line ups compare in image preprocessing tasks? 

So far from what I've read Threadrippers have higher clock speed, but run hotter and support less memory capacity and bandwidth, whereas Epyc is the opposite. But how does this translate to a border for applications in ML?

1848,datascience,I need Your advice please (student science project),"Dear Data People,

We are doing a student project as part of our biology bachelor, collecting data about hand features and collecting additional data about other traits/factors which may or may not be correlate with those hand features. Now, the question is how to process that data. Are there some (free) genius programs which may do the work? Also are there ways to put in the data and get out usable graphs/charts/diagrams?

I could imagine something like: ""deviation of the norm (reg: hand features) correlated to traits/factor w, x, y and z"" Where you see a larger corelation between the deviation of the norm and, lets say, trait w and x which belong to the category of disease. And less correlation between deviation of the norm and trait y and z which belong to the category of character traits. 

In one I'd like to depict the correlation between the single factors (w,x,y,z) and in a second graph the correlation between the categories (disease, character traits).

This is just an example. In reality there will be much much more traits and categories to connect. Also using different groups: male, female and male+female. So, this is going to be a huge mess. That's why I'm looking for a program and/or some advice.

Disclaimer: You are not doing my homework by helping me. Our uni didn't ask for that sort of extra work, but as I'm interested in this topic I want to treat this project as a chance to learn about it, thus increase its complexity just for the sake of it.

If You know any programs or can recommend great sources to learn about that topic or have some good advice, that would be awesome.

I really hope You can help me somehow.

[Dataquest](https://dataquest.io) is a website that offers courses towards the Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer career paths, mainly in Python. You can read more about it elsewhere, but here are the unique things which set it apart from other online courses:

* It is a text-based interactive learning platform, without videos.
* You read the lesson on the left side of the screen, and hone your skills using the code editor on the right side of the screen.
* It provides downloadable PDF summaries.
* Practical knowledge is taught regarding writing projects in Jupyter notebook and participating in [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com) competitions. These are important to getting more experience in data science even after you have finished the course.
* It has a community system on the website, as well as a Slack community which people say is very helpful."

This is retail data and my interviewer immediately told me that my random sample approach is wrong. He said that I should have taken a few stores at random and then used ALL their data (as in full data for all the stores picked) to train the models. According to him, you can't train the model unless you have every single data point for a store. I think that he doesn't seem to understand the concept of random sampling.

I actually think both approaches are reasonable, but that his claim of needing every single data point for a store or you are not getting the ""full picture"" is incorrect.

1889,datascience,Want to get into a data science career,"Hello. I'm a 22 year old guy from India and am currently in the final semester of my master's in mathematics degree. I've always loved math as a subject but my time in university sort of changed that feeling towards a bitter end. For a while, I was really conflicted as to what path I should pursue after finishing my master's. At one point, the most viable option seemed to be a PhD but in the present time, I have no intention of doing that. Teaching maths also doesn't sound that appealing to me however it's an option I won't mind falling back on.

I guess I could say that I wasn't well aware of my options because it was made to seem like there were none. I only started digging by myself recently and became more aware of the field of data science which is falls under applied math and xomputi In my master's, we had a few computational subjects but it was overall focused on pure math subjects which I didn't quite enjoy. Still I somehow managed to push through and have reached this point with not so remarkable marks. I even tried some online courses related to machine learning on Coursera and two weeks in, I've found it more interesting than any of the subjects in my current degree. 

I have experience in programming that I am sure certainly accounts for something. I studied C,C++, JavaScript and SQL in my computer science subsidiaries in graduation and was really good at the first three. We've also done MATLAB throughout most of our semesters and very recently did FORTRAN (which I know is kinda obscure). I'm not really familiar with the programming languages for data computations like R and Python, but I'm hoping to manage something on the side because my current degree is already quite tough with 5 papers every semester.

I considered doing a master's in data science or a computational maths field first but it is seeming to be like an impractical option for me given I've already put in two years of my time in post graduation and most of these programs are also 2 years; but most importantly, the courses are really expensive and certainly not something that I can afford. So I'm not exactly clear on what sort of study I should do for it, whether a specialization or a part-time degree. Most of my time these days goes in pondering over these things and I think I need some guidance. I've decided the direction I want to go in, but don't exactly know the way.

 I wasn't thinking this would go for this long but anyways... I will appreciate any sorts of help."

My skills are mostly in the side of EDAs, training models, NLP pipelines and tricks, which seem to need less and less a dedicated human workforce these days. At the same time I don't know if studying data engineering competencies without practical work experience is worth much."
1894,datascience,Soccer - Sports Science vs. Analytics,"I am currently watching [How to become a football data scientist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J8CwOtjOiw) and heard Dr. Sumpter mention a point regarding the difference between R and Python. He states that R is typically used for sports science while Python is used for analytics.

For anyone working in football/soccer, what is the difference between the two in this context? Does he mean sports science meaning statistics, modelling, and statistical inference and analytics meaning EDA and data cleaning? Or does he mean something else entirely?

My current supervisor has informed me I'll get a bigger salary bump if I leave and come back with the Ph.D. rather than stick it out and try to negotiate with my current company, so I assume I'll be at a disadvantage when I go through this process as I'll be applying as a student! (I'm a manager right now and would like to interview for a similar or higher level role.) 

I have casually interviewed with a few places in the past and have been frequently surprised at the types of things asked for data science manager or director level roles. One company, we'll call them Swamazon for anonymities sake, asked me to code a regex function at the level of ""write a function that splits the string."" Another company while trying to assess technical skillset went into depth about having me code a group by function in SQL. Neither was very interested in seeing examples of anything more advanced from me either.

For example, at the last project, I regularly changed the architecture of a neural network and ran the usual tests and went to do something else. Using Jupyter Notebooks also probably didn't help, since I always had to come back to run another test manually.

However, there was no real method to how I did it, and it sometimes just felt like a stroke of luck when I found better results, apart from feeling like a huge waste of time when the model underperformed.

As I understand AUC is not a very good metric to evaluate my model and F-measure might be a better alternative. 

Question#1: is my assumption correct?


The model I built has a decent AUC (~0.85) and a really low F-measure (0.3). This makes me think that I've actually built a really bad model. However, all the existing published literature only claim an AUC of 0.6 and none of them report F-measure.

We have a manual mapping and transformation defined for each incoming file, but the volume of different formats and sources is ever increasing. Im looking for a way to take any input file and to train a model that predicts for each column what the most likely corresponding column in the target file is.

I've been looking into a few things : using NLP\spacy to train a model that recognises patterns in the column data. E.g. Numeric + period + comma is likely to correspond to amount. I've also looked at modeling the data and extracting an RDF representation using a open source tool called Karma to see if I can train a model on a network graph. But really struggling to see how to implement this.

Is anyone aware of the formal name of this type of problem and if there are tried and tested approaches\implementations out there that I could build upon?"

I just finished my PhD in Astrophysics, I have a MSc in Computer Science, and I've been applying for DS roles. I don't have any ML experience, but I do have a strong programming/software engineering background from my MSc. My PhD work involved a lot of descriptive statistics, no modelling.

I applied to a Senior DS role in a company where I would love to work at. They came back to me saying I was too junior for those roles, but they had a Data Engineer position open and they liked my profile for that one. I interviewed and got the (great!) offer yesterday.

The day before I had also received another offer, for a DS position doing NLP. This is also a position I'm very excited about (however the pay is a lot less than for the DE one).

I am strongly leaning towards the DE position. However, I am worried that it will put me in an ""engineer"" box and that, if I look to move to DS later, it will be harder than it is now. Right now, even though I don't have ML experience, I have my PhD to give me leverage and it allows me to play the ""I have ML potential"" card at applications. However, in a few years from now, when I'm not coming fresh out of a PhD but from X years as an engineer, I'm not sure how that will play out. But maybe the DS position will put me in the ""NLP"" box and that will limit my options, too?

What are your thoughts? Like I said I'm fresh out of grad school and I'm feeling very anxious about this big, next career move. I have this ominous feeling that whatever I decide now will completely define my future. I have been told that in the DE position there is wiggle room to get into some DS but am not sure exactly how true this is (I will be chatting with some people in similar positions in the same company in the next few days).

1925,datascience,I found the most ridiculous solution to a data problem. How can I verify it works?,"I have unpivoted categorical data about our sales teams, and how they move through the sales process. There is a process step column with five values, a sales ID column which repeats itself because again it's unpivoted, process step change date which is the date that it moved into the process step listed in the prior column, and the employee ID of the salesperson. Finally, I have two values for product because they can sell one of two products. 


I was having a lot of trouble however with one thing. Since the data is unpivoted, and we have data for numerous steps in the sales process, there is no real easy way to filter out rows where sales is in a early step in the sales process, and has no associated value for the later stages. Since the ID column has repeating values if you just filter out the later steps in the process step column, the data won't reflect properly because sales might actually be in that later stage or even closed out the sale.... But just filtering it out doesn't actually do anything other than hide the later stage rows 


# How did I solve the issue?


I created a reference table (a copy of the original table), and added custom columns with if statements. If process step is approved then 1 else "" "" for blank. I did this five times for every process step, and now I have five columns with 1 and 0 values

From there, I used these five columns as page level filters in power bi. I filtered out any rows in the table that have a 1 for the 3 latest stages of the process step column, leaving only the first two. So basically, if there is any late stage process step at all, it's filtered out entirely.

1929,datascience,Grad School Admissions Advice,"Hey Everyone,

Firstly, I want to prefix this post with a thank you for taking the time to read this post. So this week has been rather interesting, to say the least. Back in December, I ended up applying to do an applied data science course at various UK universities and Rotman (University of Toronto). As of thus, I have only heard back from Rotman and got accepted a few weeks ago (it's their Management Analytics course). Last-minute, however, I also decided to apply to Rice University. The reason I chose rice is mostly two-fold. First of all, it's a school that I've heard really good things about. Secondly, I have some friends in the Texas area that I met online which I want to see if we can get a start-up going. It's important to note that I am a European Citizen (Italian), but I grew up most of my life as a TCK (third-culture-kid) in Asia. Hence, I went to American schools my whole life and picked up much of that culture and accent.

With their extremely selectivity, I assumed that I never even stood a chance at Rice, so when I got into Rotman, I basically set my heart on it and moved on with my life. Last night, however, I got accepted into their MDS (Professional Master's in Data Science) course, which will come out as being very similar to that of Rotmans, if not a bit more technical. Coming from an engineering background, that's actually a plus.

As of right now, I'm struggling on making my mind up on where to go. Toronto is technically speaking higher ranked than Rice across the board. However, there's something about the name that seems as if when I talk to people they rank Rice higher than UofT in their minds (let me know if that's just my social bubble). So in terms of status, my brain says UofT is better, but Rice worst-case scenario isn't a university to turn your head to. With that, it leads me on to why I care about status in the first place. At the end of the day, I couldn't care less personally, I believe in the better experience, and Rice is currently just tipping the balances in foresight. However, employers and future MBA programs, for example, may care very much about this?

It's important to note that I aim to graduate after 12 -months and find work in the country I graduate from. In the states, I'll have 2 years of guaranteed work and 2 attempts at the H1-B visa while in Canada, if I have an employer willing to hire me, I should get the work permit with no problems. My fear is that maybe in Houston I'll find a job stay for 2 years, then be forced to leave due to these issues. Granted, I could always just apply for a work visa in Canada after graduating from Rice, right?

In general, this is the gist of things: I know that I've loved living in both places, albeit I'd probably prefer the southern climate. Both universities are relatively well known in their places of interest. Job opportunities should be plentiful in both areas. I got slight scholarships for both, so tuition is basically identical. What would you guys go for, or is there something I should consider that I haven't yet posted about?

Thanks again for your input."

Have you ever thought that it'd be useful to train a model on historical weather data for some chunk of the world, but didn't want to deal with grungy data wrangling on a massive dataset to get it into a convenient format? 

Have you ever just been curious what the average temperature of Egypt in 1985 was?

Well, a friend and I made a webpage that lets you filter the 28 gig NOAA Global Summary of the Day weather dataset down to a small fraction of that, and download just the part you care about, as a csv, here:
https://gourdian.net/g/eric/noaa_gsod.global_summary_of_day

Table preview on the left, geographic and time filters and download button on the right. Delivers it as a single, clean csv, which should be easy to import into Pandas, R, a database, or whatever else you like to use to work on tabular data. CSV works with everything!

A bit about our goals and what we're trying to build:

* Filter (optional), click the button, CSV arrives on your hard drive
* Downloads are always a single CSV, no bundles with weird directory structures, no other formats
* CSVs are indexed and filterable by a few column types (lat/long and date/time at the moment), so you can download just the parts you want
* Open licensed datasets are free to download
* No signup required for downloading open datasets
* Search within and across datasets

Basically, our focus is on building something very simple - it won't be as powerful at fine-grained querying as something like BigQuery, but it should be easier to get going with.

This is a super early version of our web/javascript download client (we've never shown it publicly before, our other client is a python library), and we're trying to figure out what to make better, so we'd love any feedback, especially if it breaks for whatever reason. What can we do that would make your life easier?

Please note, it doesn't work well on mobile yet - we figured that not too many people would want to browse/download datasets there, and it's just the two of us, and... priorities. But if we're wrong, please let us know!"

Well 2 years later, I have just secured a $200k salary, $170k in base and $30 in yearly bonus (not including RSU). This is for a Data Scientist in ML role at a company in SF. I eventually settled for another company with far less salary but far better stock potential. But still. 

Given that I proved my initial point, I want to say few additional points of affirmation. 

1) Don't undersell yourself. Know your value and worth and stick to it with confidence even in this terrible economy. 

2) If you can impress the hiring manager and the senior management during interviews, they're more than happy to work with your professed worth (if not in salary, then in bonus, stocks, etc.). Otherwise, they will lowball you. 

3) Know how to play the political game during interview cycle. Master the negotiation tactics. Know how to bluff. Too many tech folks don't like to do this and think that they can keep their heads down and work hard, and their accomplishments will be naturally rewarded by some supernatural force. That's rarely the case. Data and Software folks are not immune to necessities of nuanced and skillful communication."

1949,datascience,"Making the transition from ""small data"" to ""big data""","In the past, all the work I have done has involved ""small data"". What I mean by that, the data I have used to perform statistical modelling and machine learning models - this data was ""carved out"" from a larger data source using SQL, and is able to fit into a very large excel  document (multiple spreadsheets). From here, I use R studio to import all these spreadsheets into R and ""concatenate"" the spreadsheets together (i.e. stack them on top of each other). So in the end, the final dataset I am using for my analysis is about 30 columns and 500,000 rows. From here, the analysis can take some time - but I usually put some coffee on and step away from the computer (a ""family laptop"" from Costco, no GPU) while the numbers crunch.

However, I am starting to realize that this approach will become less efficient and eventually stop working for larger data sources. I am aware that there is a whole world out there that is dedicated to dealing with and solving these problems - a world that I am not very familiar with. This world uses words like : hadoop, spark, aws, the cloud, parallelizing, apache, containerize, chunkize, etc.

As I see it, I feel that the problem can be viewed from different prespectives:

1) Performing machine learning and statistical analysis on large data might not be possible because of limitations in the individual computer you are using : this means, these procedures on this large data might not work on my computer - but it might work on my friend's (more powerful) computer who lives down the street

2)  Performing machine learning and statistical analysis on large data might not be possible because of limitations in the software (e.g. python, R) you are using : I am not very knowledgeable about what happens behind the curtains of the software, but my understanding is that software you are using (regardless of how powerful your computer is) might have certain limitations related to ""memory and ram"".

3) Both 1) and 2)

With this being said, I want to start exploring different ways to address these limitations. Based on my limited understanding of these topics, I think there are two main ways to address these limitations:

1) With money : Apparently you (or your company) can buy ""cloud services"" such as AWS, which will allow you to perform machine learning/statistical analysis on large data using ""remote servers"". I was told that this does not require a lot of knowledge or extra work - after purchasing these services, only a slight amount of extra code is required, and then you can effectively perform machine learning algorithms on big data.

2) with less money: this is where my understanding stops - apparently tools like ""hadoop"" can divide the computing costs between several computers and reduce the required time, or there is something called ""chunkize"" which allows you to sequentially feed your data into the algorithm without maxing out your computer.

How can I learn more about this? Suppose I have the same dataset with 30 columns, but this time there are 100 million rows. I want to use the random forest algorithm for a binary classification task.

How have people on r/datascience approached this kind of problem in the past?

Thanks"
1950,datascience,Thoughts on Data Science Certificate Options,"Hello,

I am trying to get a data science certificate to learn skills. I am currently an undergraduate majoring in unrelated fields. After the program, I might do freelance work if it fits into my schedule. I have no plans for data science to be my career, but think this is a valuable skillset to have. I have a lot of experience with R and really enjoy it, so I was considering [this program](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r) from Johns Hopkins on Coursera. Alternatively, I am looking at [Google's new data analytics certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics).

My current quandary is that I really enjoy R and love statistics (the focus on the Hopkins program) but also think learning the other programs that Google's program teaches will be valuable.

Has anyone done either of these before? Could you please talk about your experience? Do you have recommendations on which would better suit my goals?

1957,datascience,Asset Retirement Year - Optimization Problem," 

Hello all

I have been assigned to consult a traditional mom and pops logistic company in deciding at what year they should retire their trucks. Currently they are running them down until they cost more to repair than to sell.

I have data on their current demand for asset types and total maintenance cost of assets and obviously the number of assets on hand. I was wondering if there's hope looking to build a model using optimization with this limited set of parameters. I know in terms of cost we could potentially look at their revenue per asset and do a minimization on cost but they don't have that kind of information available and I'm only dealing with demand and maintenance cost.

Any advice would be highly appreciated!"

These teams usually spend loads of money and time to validate only to do it all over again when they retrain the model in six months. The other path I see is where teams try to treat the model as a black box and validate the surrounding infrastructure.

1971,datascience,Afraid of wasting my summer in an unrelated field. What should I do? (Kinda long),"I am a Computer Science and American Studies double major entering my junior year (class of '23) at a mid tier private school. I was recently offered a paid research mentor position over the summer and complete a research project in urban ecology with a group of high school seniors, but I am not sure if I should accept it or if I should look for opportunities more directly related to the fields I'm interested in. 

I have enjoyed working with younger students in the past but I don't know if I'm super interested in urban ecology or if that's something that I would like to do post graduation. Right now I think I'd like to go to grad school and study urban informatics (hence the American Studies and CS double major) and then do data analysis for either some non-profit or government agency, and I don't know if this will really help me do that. 

I already have some experience in data analysis. Last summer I worked as a data analysis intern for my school's IT department (but I mainly used Excel and Power BI to build some reports for them). And soon I will complete this two month long research workshop on machine learning, and I just started working in one of my school's data mining labs. 

So I don't know if I should just take the money from this urban ecology research opportunity ($5k+), bank on my other data analysis experience, and then try to get an internship more directly linked to my interests for the summer going into my senior year, or if I should bail on the urban ecology research and try to do something that is directly related to my interests for this summer to make sure I don't waste my second to last summer before graduation. What should I do? Is research in an unrelated field, viewed positively by tech employers or grad schools? Is it not worth it to still work with high school students going into my junior year of college? Any advice would be appreciated!"

I think I might start to see rapid results with it soon, but I've just got a couple of questions about how people tend to tap off the data into their notebook.

Essentially I'm wondering what people tend to do - if you use Jupyter for exploratory data analysis, do you download a csv of your data and put it in your working directory? Or do you make a call to a database API and store all the data in memory? For those that use a database API, do you ever edit the query within a notebook cell, or do you tend to use a separate SQL client? Are there other methods other than those I've listed? 

This part of the process feels like it could be a bit clunky, particularly as queries will often need a couple of iterations that you might only discover the need for after you've plotted some data. Not that this is any different with SQL+Excel."

1986,datascience,"A tale in Neural Network Plots....(Keras in R, need feedback!)"," So I've been messing around with a synthetic dataset. Here's what it looks like, I'm trying to predict attrition based on 3 potential outcomes.

This is only my training set which includes 5800 observations, I'm trying to revise my training methods before predicting.

**3 class categorical response:** 0,1,2  | Highly imbalanced, 0 = 85% of dataset, 1 = \~14.5%, 2 = 0.5%

**15 predictors:** Majority are categorical, I tried to reduce cardinality through grouping and transformations. Predictors are a mixed bag of title, role, dept. etc. etc. However, some have 50 different classes (*factors* in R)

**NN Details:**

* Layer 1: 15 inputs, 100 nodes, relu
* Layer 2: 50 nodes, relu
* Layer 3: 20 nodes, relu
* Layer 4: 3 nodes, softmax (classification)
* Lossfunction: Categorical crossentropy
* Optimizer: Adam with LR = 0.00001
* 1000 Epochs, 0.1 Validation Split, classweights included (see below code) 

I know in these cases it is best to use a random forest for categorical classifiers, but I really wanted to try neural networks so i attempted all this in R using the Keras library.

For a youtube reference to show a modelling approach I followed, you can see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrQw_fWo4lw)

So here's where I'm at and what I've encountered, along with some thoughts as to why...appreciate your feedback on these plots (all generated from Keras, during the training stage) and questions. Thanks!

[Plot #1:](https://ibb.co/Nm0C24G)What happened here? Why did my CV suddenly dip? Any thoughts? I'm stumped here...

[Plot #2:](https://ibb.co/ChWNQzS) I included dropouts after every layer, which led to this plot, my CV is yet again higher than my accuracy, what's happening at the elbow near epoch 600? Did the model calculate/find a new minima for the loss function? 

[Plot #3:](https://ibb.co/MkqVPsn) I think this is the best, removed dropouts....but yet again my CV loss is lower than actual loss. My suspicion is that when I add weights to help with the class imbalances, it inflates my loss as a result...is that correct? So not an issue?

Beyond that, anything else that is good for me to know here? I'm pretty happy and proud that I put this all together.....i did a ton more programming around this, feature engineering, and lots of side reading too, and R isn't as popular as Python, but I'm doing a bunch in R anyway these days so it was more intuitive to work with.....thanks in advance!

Currently a Computer Science student (State School, Junior, 3.51 GPA, 3.73 GPA in major) and doing a minor in Informatics.  I find myself very interested in the data space even over CS, but I see the combination as valuable given how I know I learn it I think it was good I went in this direction.  Ultimately, I want to do a Data Science grad program I think, but I am still not sure and I just don't want to jump on the Data bandwagon and I am sure the true professionals are tired of those types (aka my types).  

My question for you guys is I have dabbled with SQL and Python and I have gone pretty deep into SQL now where I think I am going to do some certs just for resume purposes.   I am interested in going deeper into Python, but how important is R?  Do people in the data space know all 3 languages plus others, or do more people go deeper into one language?  


Also, to really be a Data Engineer do you need to go further and be an expert in C++ as well?  It sems as if Python is more interface language for ML, AI, etc.

I doubt that a single personal project on a resume makes much of a difference in a job application, but supposing I see this thing through to completion, is there any way it could be negatively perceived? You wouldn't brag about your gambling winnings in a job interview.

During freshman and sophomore year I only held a few retail type jobs, so this fall I really put my all into applying to internships. After 118 applications I have finally accepted an offer to intern with a relatively well known insurance company.

Now, this is fantastic. It‚Äôs a real internship with a Fortune 500 company and if I work hard I will probably be able to get an offer to join the company after graduation. It also pays really well.

But here‚Äôs the catch: the internship is with the claims department. Given my ultimate goal, I was hoping to find a way to exercise the statistical wizardry that I have been practicing while studying the dismal science. I realize that I am incredibly fortunate to have an internship this summer, especially with Covid and all, but I‚Äôm starting to think long term about my life goals, and being a claims rep isn‚Äôt one of them.

Does anyone have experience making lateral transitions between fields in a corporate environment? I find insurance to be fascinating and would not be opposed to working as a risk analyst or a data analyst, but I‚Äôm only just now getting my foot in the door.

In my studies, I came up with the idea of a specific project. The aim of this project is to get the probability of an event occurs (a goal in a soccer match, because I like soccer and that could be an incentive to learn faster), given certain circumstances. 

Basically I want to know the probability of a goal occurs if: it's raining, the elapsed time of the match and if the team with the ball is losing the match. As you can see, I have continuous and categorical independent variables. I know that, for continuous variable, I could just make a linear regression. But my aim is to get all of this variables into the same model. 

My doubts: what are the best models or theories I could use, which the output is a probability prediction? What models can be fitted with those different types of data?

(I've already studied about logistic regression, but in that case the output is a prediction whether there is or there isn't a goal, and what I want is the probability of that goal occurring in each scenario. I thought about putting this logistic regression prediction into a Monte Carlo simulation, but I don't know if it's feasible or even if the prediction will change after each simulation. I don't know if this simulation would answer my questions either).

Right now, I'm not even trying to perform any model. Just trying to know how can I do it, to start studying it. Any help is appreciated. Thank you."

2002,datascience,Mathematical definition of the bias-variance tradeoff,"This is a topic that I have discussed heavily in the past, and I constantly see it popping up as a question and source of confusion among the community, asking what exactly is the bias-variance tradeoff, why is it called that, and how do you actually define them in objective terms? I was lucky enough to have a professor in my university days by the name of Shai-Ben David that has an excellent textbook titled *Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms* that is theoretically oriented, and it had the best definition of the bias-variance tradeoff that I have seen to this day, which is a topic that I think is heavily misunderstood today, though I would love to hear the opinions of others that might disagree with me.

**Common misconception:** For example, I have seen people define the bias-variance tradeoff as referring to the variance of outputted predictions of your model relative to small local changes to input features. However, we all know that variance refers to the overfitting error, and this definition would imply that a constant-predictor model *f(x) = k* that simply outputs a constant value (parameter that is learned) would have a variance of zero, and therefore will not overfit? Even if it is given a training set with only a single example, it will not overfit at all? This definition clearly does not make sense. I think it is common to see highly overfit models with high variance that also happen to have highly volatile predictions relative to small changes in input features, however that is NOT a requirement nor is it a good definition.

**Another common misconception:** Another common definition of bias-variance or overfitting-underfitting that I have seen before is usually referring to models that have a learning curve over the course of their training (usually neural networks or ensemble models) where you can see the training error and validation error change over the course of training. Typically, the training error always improves, while the validation error improves for a while until it reaches its 'peak validation performance' iteration and then the validation error starts getting worse while training keeps improving. Sometimes, people will refer to the model iterations BEFORE the 'peak validation' as being underfitting or high bias, and then refer to the model iterations AFTER the 'peak validation' as being overfitting or high variance. I understand why people often make this association and confusion, but again it doesn't make much sense. Why are model iterations before considering underfitting while the iterations after are overfitting? Does this mean that the 'peak validation' iteration is not overfitting or underfitting? How do you even define bias/variance for models that don't have a learning curve? There is a lot lacking here.

**So then, what is the bias-variance tradeoff?**

The bias variance trade-off is a useful concept that stems from decomposing the generalisation error. Before we can understand this, we need to define a few concepts that are important.

First, we need to frame the training of a model as a mathematical process. What are we doing when we take a linear regression model and feed it a bunch of training data? One way to look at this, is that we have a model hypothesis class *H = { f(x) = kx + m | for all k,m }* which is the set of all possible simple univariate linear regression models that we could learn. Then, training a model, is basically running a TrainingAlgorithm that takes in the training dataset as input and outputs a model *f(x)* that is from the hypothesis class *H*. So basically, *H* is the set of all possible models, and training a model is basically trying to find the best model in *H* that fits our training data best and that we think will generalise the best.

Given those definitions, we can now define the key terms that we need to bring it all together.

**What is generalisation error?**

The generalisation error, in this example, is the error that we expect to observe by training a linear regression model on the training dataset that we have and deploying it on future unseen data examples drawn from the target distribution. Basically, it is the true error of the model that we will have. The reason that we have a 'test set' is so we can estimate the generalisation error. Now, thankfully, smarter people than me have gone ahead and done a bunch of mathematical wizardry to decompose the generalisation error into the following definition:

*GeneralisationError = TrueError + Bias + Variance*

Note that *Bias = UnderfittingError* and *Variance = OverfittingError*

***What is TrueError?***

TrueError is defined as the underlying error of the target distribution. For example, suppose that we are given training data from the target distribution of samples (x, y) where y = 5x + 2. Then we can clearly see that this can be perfectly predicted (if we know the underlying true distribution and can model it), and the TrueError would be 0. However, for another example, maybe the target distribution is y = 5x + 2 + u, where u is a random Normal variable with mean 0 and variance 1. Well clearly, even if we know the true underlying distribution, we won't be able to perfectly predict it because of the underlying error of the target distribution, and the TrueError is equal to the variance of the random variable u.

**What is Bias?**

Bias is defined as the difference between the generalisation error of the BEST model from our hypothesis class *H and the* underlying *TrueError*. For example, if the true underlying target distribution is y = 5x + 2, then we can see that our model class of simple linear regression models *H* contains this exact model! So therefore, the best model instance is *f(x) = 5x + 2* where *f in* H, and we can see that our Bias/UnderfittingError is equal to 0! As you can see, *Bias* or the *Underfitting Error* is basically the error introduced by choosing our model hypothesis class *H.* If our hypothesis class contains the true target distribution model, then our bias will be 0, otherwise the farther our 'best' model in the class is from the true underlying target distribution, then the higher our bias will be. Notice that this definition has nothing to do with the volatility of the model output predictions, and has nothing to do with the learning curve.

**What is Variance?**

Variance is defined as the difference between the generalisation error of the BEST model from our hypothesis class *H* and the error of the EXPECTED model that will be learned from our class *H* given the finite training set of size *N* that is fed into the training algorithm. To continue with our example from above, we know that the best model in our class *H* is the model instance *f(x) = 5x + 2*. However, suppose that we are given a training set of size 1 with only a single sample of (x,y). Given only 1 sample, our training algorithm may choose the model instance *f(x) = 4x + 1*, which is worse than our best model and will have higher generalisation error. The difference between the expected GE of our model trained on the dataset of size 1 and the expected GE of our 'best model' is the variance or overfitting error component of the GE. Notice how the variance is dependent on the model hypothesis class *H*, the training algorithm *A,* and the size of the training dataset. This is why we can reduce overfitting by increasing the size of our training dataset, or we can reduce overfitting by reducing the size of our model hypothesis class (by choosing a simpler model or adding regularization which typically reduces the size of the model hypothesis class).

**TL;DR:** An accurate mathematical exact definition of underfitting/overfitting A.K.A the bias-variance tradeoff is useful to understand even beyond a theoretical context. For a more comprehensive understanding, I recommend that you read the textbook I mentioned at the beginning of the post."

2045,datascience,R connection with SQL Server to fetch raw data - Reason to learn dplyr - tidyverse tools?,"Hi,

the title might be a bit confusing so let me explain myself better. R can be very easily connected with SQL Server to fetch raw data. I am not an expert in R but I am quite good with T-SQL, thus I am wondering if it would make sense to me to learn the tools offered by the tidyverse to manipulate, clean the data, since I already clean and prepare my raw data already from SQL?

However, since I am no expert in R and I still read lots of documentation on internet etc... very often I see people who swear to god that dplyr / tidyverse changed their life and wondered how they could work before without these tools.

Now, I am sure I miss something but... If I already prepare, clean, merge, etc.. the raw data with T-SQL and just run a query to fetch the resutls in R.. Are there still reasons that I am missing for which it would make sense to ""explore"" the tidyverse?

2046,datascience,Are inhouse data science models are getting replaced by specialized companies?,"I have noticed that there are more and more ML driven companies around, solving quite specific use cases with ML. A lot of them are getting better constantly and the work as a data scientist in product companies shifts from building these models to knowing which companies are out there to solve the problem.

There are still some very unqie problems that require custom solutions, but as the number of AI startups grows and the giants are offering more and more use cases in their cloud solutions, the work for us is getting less. A lot of internal models, we built in the past years can now be replaced by specialized external tools. (fraud detection, risk scoring, nlp tasks and even image classification)

Usually when a project in our company requires some ML, we were asked to find a solution, but today the most interesting problems are nowadays solved by specialized companies, having many customers and therefore more data and a highly specialized team to solve the issue. Oftentimes their salespeople are also overpromising, but in the end leaders often prefer to use their solutions, instead of building something custom. So, we end up losing a lot of the highly interesting use cases to external competitors, making them even better with our data.

I wonder if you also noticed this trend and how do you deal with it? Do you think that, as a data scientist, it's better to get into these specialized companies as they gain more ground?"

2079,datascience,Facing redundancies for DS?,"Due to the current climate, roles in DS may be made more and more redundant - anyone here has ever be made redundant whilst holding such role?

1. What was the reason given by the company?
2. Was it professionally delivered?
3. How's everything now? Looking back - what could you change?

Note though, I appreciate some won't be made redundant (e.g. you company has core DS function, etc.) - but I do think as a company is being reduced into smaller headcounts, specialized fields would take a hit as well."

Currently I do this all manually by storing the labels in CSV‚Äôs I create that have the xy coordinates of each object in each training image. I made a really kludgy GUI to help but it‚Äôs not something I want to share üòÜ

I want to start doing this in a way that‚Äôs more standardized and compatible with other open-source tools. Ideally something where an intern could use the tools to label a pile of images that I would then use to train my models.

Where do I start? Are there popular frameworks for this? I am trying to standardize on TensorFlow 2 and Python if that matters. Beginner to intermediate level of experience."

2090,datascience,Does going back to previous employer ever make sense?,"I had been in industry A for 3 years. At the last year of the 3 years, I finished my master in stats and transitioned to a DS team. However, I planned to check out other industries when I got my degree and so I left the company and found work somewhere else. I had good relationships and closed an impactful project before I left so the reason was solely for changing of pace/environment.

The new company quickly restructured due to COVID, I was forced to find another job and thankfully I did.

This new job is an advanced analytics team that does ""data science"". Most of the projects are solved in heuristic ways. There is also a centralized DS team that gets most of the projects so we end up getting the type of requests from business people so they can ""make data-driven decision"". I'm the only DS person, but without the title, so there's no one to learn from. In summary, I feel underutilized and don't see my current team getting more serious projects in the future.

I just found out my old team had an opening and now I'm contemplating on if I should apply. What would you do in this type of situation? Do you just apply? Is it appropriate to reach out to my previous manager to gauge his interests of having me back?

The part that made me unsure is 1. I will have 2 short stints on my resume and 2. if management would look at this prodigal son situation unfavorably"

2120,datascience,Does actual Data Science happen outside of Academia/Research or FAANG?,"Obviously I'm being somewhat hyperbolic, but the thread on ""how much of data science is lying"", mixed with current personal sentiment, got me thinking.

Industry currently calls the job anything they  like - Data Analyst, Data Scientist, ML Engineer, AI Practitioner, whatever. But it just all seems to be in name only. The lion's share of job postings I see say something like: ""We want a data scientist whose primary responsibility will be to take care of our databases and add more data to it. You'll build a couple of dashboards, and provide datasets to people that don't know SQL. Oh and it would be super helpful if you know ML and deep learning, even though you won't have time to do anything of the sort. And even if you did have time, your manager knows almost nothing about how to run actual data science projects, though the manager said they took a crash course on Udemy, so that's good enough, right? We'll gaslight you during the entire interview process about what you'll do, but if we're really being honest, we spent the last 30 years acquiring companies, but spent and did little to nothing to unify our data and technology, and now we are just throwing bodies and money at the splintered fiefdoms landscape that is our tech stack in the hope that eventually a William Wallace will rise and be able to give us a unified picture of our company. After that, maybe we'll get to ML.""

But, let's say your job actually entails some elements of data science. Enter the thread ""how much of data science is lying"". It just feels like the nine circles of data hell, and that the utopian vision of a role with clear delineation between database admins, data analysts, and data scientists, with competent and knowledgeable managers, and with actual data sci projects, is some sort of fever dream / Waiting for Godot nightmare."

2123,datascience,"Fellow unemployed Data Scientists in the job market, what's been your story?","2 YOE Data Scientist from the Bay Area here. I've been in the job market for 3 harrowing months, going on multiple final interviews with no success. It's been crippling, and I'd love to hear what your journey and experience has been like. Partly, it'd be good to share our mutual pain but also to understand who we are competing against.

Starting with myself, I found the interview process to not be all that difficult, but the competition to be (supposedly) extreme. It seems like you have to more than perfect on your SQL/pandas questions, and if there is an SOB who can solve the problem faster and with less temp tables than you, you won't get the job just because of that single hair difference. And even if you did the best, maybe someone has a Ph.D while you only have a masters and you don't have a Fang on your resume, only a medium sized start up.

I was told during one of my final interviews in a growing company that i was one of 7 other candidates (how is that a final interview then??). And according to a career specialist I knew from my bootcamp a while back it seems like job market in feb will be more intense than dec of last year, for a variety of reasons.

I'd love to hear what your experience has been like, what you think is keeping you from getting the offer, and any strategies we can share to get ahead of the 7 other candidates in the final interview who basically look like us in very similar way.

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for the supportive reply. Great suggestions from the thread:

1. Look at unexplored spaces like government jobs, non-Bay area jobs (although these companies are the only ones reaching back to me. My experience has shown that location is an important variable for companies even though on linkedin they celebrate wfh policies on the surface).
2. People with 3.5+ YOE are also struggling to even get final interviews.
3. The Data Science bubble might have finally burst, and companies are realizing that we aren't as valuable as Data/ML Engineers or don't know how to use us properly (story of my life in my last company).

2147,datascience,"Knocked the analysis out of the park, then...","So, I'm curious if other people have stories like my recent major foul-up. Hearing them may dissipate my seething self directed rage.

I have a running project that involves scraping/parsing these PDFs. The number of documents at each release is in the millions. A local government agency makes them available for individuals and it seems I'm the only person to realize they contain a huge amount of interesting data. So every year I have to come up with a list of target urls that involves updating multiple large-ish datasets that are reliably in a different format each year. The download then takes about a week of babysitting (while I continue updating dataframes). Then the parsing... utter nightmare. The PDFs change format some every year so I have to tweak all of my regex statements.

This year there were some major pandemic related policy changes and the seniors, knowing I had this data, wanted it asap. It took me about two weeks to get and prep the data. Which TBH was moving mountains. Then I consumed huge amounts of coffee to work late nights as if I was still in grad school. Somehow I did the analysis piece in only three days. The end result was fantastic. The conclusions it reached could only be done with this data and were highly interesting. Not to mention the bitchin' maps I made.

I sent it out as soon as I could the day before our weekly meeting... and then set the alarm on my phone incorrectly that night. Slept clean through the meeting. Apparently the first thing the head of the office did was ask for me to walk everyone through the analysis. One of the partners was even on the call to hear about it. And I slept entirely through my time to shine."

2175,datascience,Opinions on Elo-rating system and it's usefulness?,"I'm a student and recently began a project gathering and analyzing different sport results and the teams behind them. It's actually a lot of fun, having a history of my own in the competitive field, but also quite useful when learning web scraping and finding out about all kinds of libraries that make my life easier in terms of statistics and visualization. A recommended past-time for all.

&amp;#x200B;

I had in mind to implement a Elo-rating to find out teams/athletes most dominant in their field to be able to compare, let's say, a hockey team at it's prime to football and see who was actually ""better"". How trustworthy this actually is, I won't comment on, it's just for curiosity. However, this did raise a few question considering the usage of Elo in general, especially in football.

&amp;#x200B;

In the far-spread sport of football (or soccer for that one loud minority) the construction of leagues is a logical, yet vast hierarchy of tiers, and beginning the analysis like the definition of Elo states, giving each new team the average rating at the time seems highly illogical. This would mean that all teams at my year 0 would be rated equal, but we know for a fact that they are not, for the teams in lower tiers are worse. However, because the interaction between teams of different tiers is limited to cup-competitions with far less matches than the league, a (comparatively) well performing a lower tier could easily have it's rating higher than a team from a higher tier, due to the selective matches. These do vanish at some point though, hopefully, as the best teams in lower leagues move up and the worst drop down, but at least for some time the ratings are guaranteed to be misleading. How long, I can't say yet. Would there be a concrete method to take this into account and calculate how much initial handicap there should be in the ratings? Or should I just use an absolutely massive amount of data dating back decades to let the initial wrongness smooth out over time?

&amp;#x200B;

This also got me thinking, do you professionals use Elo or a modified version of it anywhere in the actual industry? If not, is there another rating system more fit for a situation like this? Is Elo actually good for anything ""real"", and not just for sports?"

* Working as a Research Software Engineer currently with an Aerospace company in a data analytics team (led and spearheaded a few projects to do with data analysis and ML applied to weather or NLP for software requirements)
* At work, I founded and co-lead an AI/ML community of practice (largest active community in the company) with about 800 members and monthly meetings
* Outside of work, I run a youtube channel and discord community where I showcase my ML projects applied to games and, more recently, help teams of beginners create ML applications. I also am working on my own right now, a recommendation system API that will feed into an anime recommendation website with 70K+ users. 

I‚Äôm looking specifically at Brown University‚Äôs program right now (they‚Äôre the only ones on my list that are still accepting - but I‚Äôm open to suggestions). I‚Äôm thinking of either their CS MS ([https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/computer-science-scm](https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/computer-science-scm)) or the Entrepreneurial one ([https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/innovation-management-and-entrepreneurship-scm](https://www.brown.edu/graduateprograms/innovation-management-and-entrepreneurship-scm)). 

Here are the questions I had:

* What accomplishments should I focus on to stand out in my application?
* I plan on reaching out to current faculty and grad students at Brown, what are the best ways to approach this? What questions would be most insightful?
* Are there other schools which have applications open that are good to consider?
* Should I take a technical masters as opposed to one focused on management? I love coding but have historically enjoyed leadership as well, plus it seems like it‚Äôll provide a good diversity in skills.
* What are the best ways to reduce the cost of grad school tuition? I‚Äôve heard TA-ing is great but I‚Äôm sure it is equally competitive so I‚Äôm open to other ideas.
* Is there anything else I should be doing to make myself stand out in the next month or so?

Thank you for all your time and wisdom!"

I think about previous jobs that used to be high skilled and then became obsolete. Jobs like being a Telegraph operator, call center reps and even a job at McDonald‚Äôs decades ago was considered a high skilled or respected.

Just makes me wonder at what point will this field be too saturated or have TOO MANY people working there and thus lowering the salary range and eventually even becoming obsolete.

2210,datascience,Driving a 17 hour roadtrip coming up. Best audio (podcasts? audiobooks? other?) to teach data science skills / intuition?,"Unique question, I know. But I'm looking to make a 17 hour roadtrip as productive as possible, and specifically looking to gain intuition with data science skills. I've taken intro stats/data science classes, so I wouldn't say I'm an \*absolute\* beginner, but maybe one step up.

Lets be real: I'm **not** going to become an expert practitioner behind the wheel (if I'm not in front of a computer programming in Pandas/Python/R/ whatever )... but 17 hours of driving does sound like a good learning opportunity.

Here are some topics I'd like to explore more in depth:

* Statistical intuition (and what the different types of tests mean, like T tests, anova, hypothesis testing, etc)
* How to speak intelligently about the different types of supervised and unsupervised learning (I.e. linear/logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, etc)

I'd love if it was engaging - listening to a stats audiobook wouldn't be the dream :)

Any **specific** podcasts/audiobooks/lectures would be really appreciated! I started looking at the list of podcasts here: [https://realpython.com/data-science-podcasts/](https://realpython.com/data-science-podcasts/) but they seem more topic-specific, rather than building data science intuition (if that makes sense).

In other words: *how would you fill up 17 hours of audio to teach someone data science fundamentals in an engaging way?*

2215,datascience,Suggestions for a data serialization format?,"Hi all - I'm asking for help because you never know what you don't know, and I may be missing some good ideas in my searching:

I'm looking for a data storage format. The input is sensor data, usually 2-4 bytes (including 3-byte), on the order of a few hundred sensors at 5k-100k samples per second, so up to 50MB/second. In addition, there's other sensors, much lower throughput, like 10 samples/second.

Our solution now is working well enough, but is custom-made and therefore requires custom code to read/write/analyze. It basically says ""A block is 1 second of data, and is 50,000 3-byte values for Sensor A and 10 4-byte values for sensor B"" and that metadata goes into a file (like schema, but this was invented like 30 years ago before XML), and then the data file just grows 150,040 bytes every second.

So, in search of a file format that is:  
* Supported - ideally has plugins with MATLAB, C, Python, and LabVIEW. I know I'd be lucky to get 2 of the 4.
* Space efficient. I'm okay with say, 20% overhead. This rules out a lot of ones I've found which insist on metadata for every record, but maybe I just need to think differently. I'm okay with grouping data into 1-second chunks though.
* Supports asynchronous data streams.. or at least synchronous at different (but even multiple of) rates.
* Some metadata (a friendly label to the data, conversion on how to convert from say 0 ‚Üí 2^N to real world units, etc)
* Support for 3-byte data desired. Otherwise I'm wasting 25% of my space on some systems :)

Since this is on an embedded device, and for sensor data, a lot of the newer features like easy analysis are not needed. The scientists transform this time-series data in order on the full data file, so there's no need for easy access to just one part of the dataset. And files aren't used by multiple users concurrently or anything.

Thank you! Feel free to suggest anything."

2230,datascience,MLOps is just glorified DevOps,"ML Ops is trending. But is it really something new? I think it's not.

* DevOps and MLOps have the same culture
   * End-to-end shared responsibility for a team
   * Automating everything 
   * Autonomous teams
   * Continuous improvements and learning from failures
   * All these aspects are true for both DevOps and MLOps
* Tools are the same
   * For example, if we take Kubeflow, it‚Äôs a thing on top of Kubernetes
   * For metrics, it‚Äôs Prometheus
   * For CI/CD, it‚Äôs GitLab or something like that
* Experimenting
   * A/B tests existed long before MLOps
* Most of the problems in ML are engineering problems
   * Deploy this web-service inside a web application 
   * Or apply this model inside an ELT
   * This is pretty standard for usual engineering problems 
   * Operational support is the same

What's really different is that MLOps engineers work with ML while DevOps work with pretty much everything (also ML)

I started a new job a few months ago as a senior data scientist at a large financial services company. I previously was in a small fintech consultancy and a large consultancy firm before that.

This is my first leadership position and I am struggling (partly due to remote working)

I have identified the following problems in the team:

\- Notebooks are often not readable, making it very hard to review other people's work.

\- Production code is written procedurally and is very very coupled. Therefore it cannot be reused. Think a piece of code that is so coupled to the XGboost DMatrix that it can't be used for non xgboost projects

\- Code is very coupled to a particular cloud provider

\- General lack of software skills

I have been tasked with making changes and getting people to join my vision but I am struggling due to:

\- People thinking I am a maverick for setting standards. A feedback comment was that someone had said ""there are too many standards, I can't do this anymore"" but that person had also said they hate reading other people's code and tries to avoid it

\- People upset that I am rejecting their PRs for production code almost all the time

\- People not understanding why decoupled and extendable code is good and saves time

I am finding things are a bit slower to progress and my manager has made a few comments about how I am not implementing these changes quick enough

I find my self going through cycles of loving and hating it but I cannot help but feel there must be a better way. But I'd prefer if the rollercoaster of sentiment could stop.

I know the most obvious answer is: 'yes it's called tidyverse'. I'm aware of that and make as heavy use of it as much as I can, but sometimes when I find myself for some reason forced to use the base API for something e.g. plotting an image of a matrix. I'm just like why the fuck is this thing rotated 90 degrees? Or when I am using the matrix api: why does MARGIN mean 2 different things in sweep() &amp; apply()? Why does norm() not work on vectors? Or more generally if we need to replace the vast majority of the base api with api which makes sense (e.g. library(tidyverse), library(Matrix), etc...) then does the base language of R itself actually offer value?

I know this is biased because like I said I go through cycles of loving and hating it and right now I hate it. But still please give me some perspective. Tell me why I am wrong, or if I am right what are the alternatives? I don't believe Matlab is nearly as useful for statistics applications (I think) however it is much cleaner in general; python is something I'm considering just making a full switch to (currently I bounce between R &amp; python), but of course it isn't as math oriented and can sometimes be overly verbose.

For me MOOCs on edx or coursera were not that helpful. I loose attention and get distracted easily when watching videos, it makes me nervous and unattentive. So there is not a single MOOC that I would recommend.

Udacity was different - the Machine Learning Engineer Programme was good, I gained at least some skills - although I would have expected more. So also no enthusiastic recommendation here.

The best thing I found so far was codecademy. The start of a course is often very basic and you get bored or distracted easily then, too, but after some time it gains momentum and becomes interesting.

Another good tipp are kaggle kernels or courses. Having a look at the code there can be quite interesting, and it is completely free.

The same holds for stackoverflow. You have to know what to look for, but almost every question that you can conceive of has been answered here - usually in an excellent way.

So codecademy, kaggle and stackoverflow would be my primary recommendations, although I am still looking for a more thorough, more structured course.

Maybe you can recommend some MOOC, either on coursera, edx or udacity..."
2254,datascience,R Question- Passing function argument to data frame name," 

Hello,

I'm a long-time SAS user that recently started at a company that uses exclusively R. I'm having a hard time with something that I imagine is pretty straightforward. I have a function with a single argument (t). I'd like to pass t to a dataframe name. Below is my test function, I'd like the starting\_TM\_t dataframe to pull the function's argument for variable t into the dataframe name.

\#Test function

test\_function&lt;-function(t) {

starting\_TM\_t&lt;&lt;-transition\_matrix\[c(-9)\]

}

test\_function(t=1)

In SAS I could just use the following syntax:

starting\_TM\_&amp;t.&lt;&lt;-transition\_matrix\[c(-9)\]

Is there a simple way to do this in R?"

2278,datascience,[Career] Anybody here contemplating a change of career?,"Full disclosure, posted the following over on r/statistics and it really resonated with a lot of people and was curious to see how people here felt. It seems that my experience isn't unique.

I've been doing a lot of thinking career-wise, currently working as a data scientist in the UK but getting so so tired of the grind. PhD in a stats field, which seems to be interpreted as ""kick me"". For me, the problem is the hype and expectations. Some of the people (and managers) I've worked with are completely divorced from reality. I'm thinking about a complete change of career.

My current workflow is:

1. Manger/C-level exec reads something outlandish, wants to replicate it. Makes outlandish promises too other people.
2. Non-technical manger scopes it, does a poor job; doesn't look at the data or think about how to integrate the new proposed system into the existing system; doesn't understand what's needed and throws the project at you.
3. The scope, budget, time-scale and resources have all been decided for you. ""Heres the data"", nobody bothers to see (or ask) if the data has value or is in any way related to the problem. ""Its data, it's the new oil"", ""All data has equal value \[a medium article told me so\]"". Nobody ever seem to say; ""we have data what can we learn from it""? It's ""I want X and here's some data"".
4. Project is not a two-way street; there is no appetite experimentation. You spend most of your time managing expectations, bring people back down to earth and trying to reduce scope etc. Non-technical manger doubles down on scope, budget etc. and blames project shortfalls on everybody but themselves.
5. Final project is nowhere close to what the original manager thought was possible; they are bitterly disappointed but never stop to ask themselves if they were part of the problem. At the retrospective its concluded that ""more communication is needed"".
6. Rinse and repeat.

Then there are some of your fellow data scientists who are quite happy to turn out unworkable models, butchered the stats, but claim victory. Top manager see this (and this person) as a success and sees you as somebody who is a bit too pessimistic with estimates and deliverables. I mean we can all throw non-symmetric bimodal data at model that assumes Gaussian data and call it a win, but to me that's just BS.

I feel like the hype train has left the rails and reached orbit. You are constantly up against inhuman targets. Unbelievably 40% of European AI start-ups, claiming to use ""AI"", don't actually use any AI?! \[1\]. Company execs are literally just gaslighting one other at this point! The problem for me is the hype coupled with management that aren't willing to invest in the resources or time needed to set up environments and workflows necessary to do data science. Management seem to expect google level results on shoestring buggets.

Is this the wrong field for me? I'm burning out; I want to work in a field where you aren't expected work miracles while competing colleagues that are peddling snake oil.

* What are your careers like?
* Have I just been unlucky with the companies I've worked in?
* Is this standard? Is there grass greener elsewhere? I'm honestly thinking about retaining as a plumber.

Currently, these products exist on a Flask-based web app, using tools such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Sklearn - primarily recommender systems. 

I'm curious what others have done to allow communication between a Java stack and python (or even R, Julia, etc) based ML product. Having never worked as an SWE, I'm really taking a shot in the dark here: Maintain both stacks/web apps and create an API to pass messages back and forth..?

Alternatively, I believe that Spark is originally written in Java, so perhaps constraining ourselves to Spark modeling options would be the least invasive option..

How can I avoid this in the future?  Tips for vetting clients if you're doing freelance bioinformatics work?  Tips for signing contracts (like do I need to write my own?  get a lawyer to write it?)

Almost two months ago, I signed a contract to do bioinformatics consulting work for a very small company (essentially just one scientist with an LLC and an NIH grant).  She needed basic things like data fetching, data cleaning, etc., of HBV genomes.  She was in a bind, so I agreed to work quickly and I settled for $60/hr.  Way too low, I know.  But this was my first consulting experience and I weighed the experience more than the money earned.  Anyways...we agreed to terms and I did 30 hours of work for her.  (I actually did more like 45 hours of work, but I only billed 30 hrs because the rest was research on HBV genomic data.   I sent the invoice on Oct. 30th.  She was upset that it was ""more hours than what she expected"" - although two weeks before I told her how many hours I had worked and explained that in addition to fetching and cleaning the data I was writing scripts to automate it for the future.  She said she understood it would be more time-intensive in the beginning and I should keep going.  Hence, 30 hrs instead of the 10 hrs which was my initial commitment.  Note: that was NOT my estimate of how much time it would take, it was the max hours I was comfortable committing to per week with my full-time job.  When she expressed disapproval of the number of hours, I stood firm and explained what I did with the time.  I reminded her that these 6 repetitive processes have now been automated, so they will be very fast.  One thing I did is I wrote up documentation for her to explain what I did, the exact parameters I used to clean data, my summary of the data quality, and the location of all the files in the AWS cloud.  No one in the past did this for her, and she literally has no idea where any of the data is located that these people she hired obtained and produced.  So we were in communication about the number of hours, and also $60/hr is really low for a bioinformatics consultant anyway. I can provide details about everything I did here if people want to judge whether it's reasonable.

I've emailed her twice in the last month for ""updates"" and it appears she has ghosted me.  I am willing to eat this $1,800 and chalk it up to a learning experience.  I have also removed all the work I did from the cloud, so unless they preemptively copied it elsewhere then they got essentially nothing from me (except for work summaries sent via email, but no data described therein).  The thing is, I still wasted my time and it was a lot of aggravation.  So how do I prevent this in the future?  I signed the contract but she never mailed me back a copy of it signed by her.   The contract is valid in the state of Virginia, but I don't live there.

I would really appreciate thoughtful advice and/or constructive criticism.  I've gotten more wonderful advice from considerate people in this subreddit than any other...I hope it continues. Thanks!"

2295,datascience,Certificates and projects. Next step? Is it worth it?,"Hi everyone and goodafternoon,

I feel like this topic has been talked before but Im in the midst of what is my next step.
A little background for you guys. This way you can understand the place im at. I was a math mayor and in my senior year I transfered to computer science since I like programming. So basically I extended my time at uni 2 more years and have only the computer science courses left. I already have a little more than a year worth of programming in C++ and Python. Recently took this semester Statistical Data Analysis with Python and Jupyter Lab. Next semester I will be taking Data Mining and Machine Learning. Probably will use Keras and Tensorflow for deep learning, and UCI or Kaggle for Machine Learning. Im psyched to learn about it. But have some doubts and concerns.

My mayor concerns is that although I know the basics/foundations, I still don‚Äôt have an internship and my gpa is almost 3.0(2.97) which is a mayor concern for me. It will be harder for me to get a job after graduation. I started to look at internship to gain expirience but I dont have much projects in my belt, I only have my assignments from my class to show. Most of the internships require a 3.0 or more and I need something to stand out and get that expirience prior to graduation.

Here is where I need you guys help to mentor me and advice me in what is the best next step I can take. For this Christmas I was thinking to get a course in EDX/Coursera/Udacity to learn more about data science as a speciality. They offer this programs in which in the end you have to do a capstone and post it on github which can help a lot to have opportunities. Im leaning towards it since I have all this christmas break to learn. There are courses varying from Harvard, MIT, John Hopkins, IBM so much to pick but I don‚Äôt know which. Im leaning to pick a course that offers capstone so this way I can share it on linkedin and put it on resume and CV.

This brings me to the last concern. Are those certificates worth it? Will me having a certificate that I took the courses raise value and/or probability to get an internship and eventually a job? The way I see it is that projects can help you get an internship and internship helps you get a job. As of right now I want to have projects on me to get an internship(or I think this is the best way) to gain valuable expirience. I think/feel that by having a certificate with projects can help me get an internship and progress into my professional life. Am I wrong? Will it be worth it? 

If you took the time to read this I want to thank you for your time and will be deeply greateful for your help provided. Willingly open to discuss and ask more questions about this. If you have time, the DM is open for futher talks, questions and doubts. Thanks you all. Have a nice day and take care!"

2329,datascience,Data Science is not an easy and quick job that can get things done magically fast.,"My company hired a three man team of data scientists (including me, a Jr. Data Scientist). 

They throw us dirty ass data sets which were never vetted by data engineers, just developers tossing whatever they wanted in the databases and tracking fuck all. 

Then they expect the team to do ‚Äúdata science-y stuff‚Äù in 2-3 days. 

They don‚Äôt understand that data scientists requires a whole fucking lot of time to talk with stakeholders, understanding what they want, understanding what‚Äôs available, and then working with data engineers to see if any of this is already available but not stored properly (clean ups etc). 

Then comes the understanding of the relations between data sets within the database, then comes the math hypothesis and then comes the experimentation. 

Visuals are a by product of that experimentation.  Coding comes into play when we construct our experiments, and when we visualise them (SQL to Tableau). 

But my fucking god. 2-3 days is fucking ridiculous. Most companies think data science teams are just an extension of the engineering arm that validates their stupid business decisions to make numbers go brrrr. 

I‚Äôve never seen a company tell their team of data scientists to wing the numbers and try to get a target close to what‚Äôs expected just to please the board and senior management.

Current projects I have consist of some Regression(Linear,Logistic), Clustering projects. Also got a few Deep Learning projects with Binary Classification (mostly Kaggle competition data). For the Regression and Clustering projects, I mostly scraped data myself or asked some of my friends for relevant data. 

Also would appreciate if you described how you tackled the internship search, what projects you did, academic stats if you are comfortable, and company you interned at (again if you are comfortable).

I am committed to starting a self study plan next semester in order to learn the appropriate technical skills and start working on DS projects related to the healthcare industry. 

My current goal is to become an expert in the niche of data science/predictive analytics for patient outcomes using healthcare data sets. I honestly don't even know if this kind of thing is even relevant in  the healthcare industry at the moment but I have seen/read a lot about how big changes in the healthcare industry have been accelerated due to COVID-particularly the digitization of health care. 

I will be taking 3/4 Math classes every semester for the rest of my college experience because those are the only classes I have left to fulfill, so I will be able to saturate myself entirely in stats/math/data science as long as I can stay disciplined enough to also study book/online classes in my own time. 

Obviously the priority for me is to actually work on DS projects and demonstrate proficiency in data engineering, coding, and producing actionable models, etc. I am worried that even if I spend 3-5 hours a day ingesting material on how to to X,Y,Z I will still have no real idea of how to apply X, Y, Z in an industry setting context and that I will be perpetually clueless as to what kinds of things I really need to be learning for my career?

So here is my question. Given that R encompasses a pretty massive amount of code, I was wondering how you would recommend learning R as efficiently as possible, given that I already have plenty of experience in other data-friendly programming languages. I say efficiently because I don't want to draw too much time away from brushing up on all the other things that I expect to come up when I start interviewing (e.g. data structures &amp; algorithms, statistics in general). In particular I am curious where the most obvious advantages for R, compared to Python, crop up in practice.

I work for a healthtech company and work on the analytics team. Our team builds ETL jobs and dashboards. Nobody on our team has a background in math, statistics, CS, SE etc and nobody has ever built a production model before. I took a 12-week DS bootcamp but that only gave me like a 30,000 foot view of ML.  


We're doing our 2021 product roadmap and my director wants us to add a new feature for our customers to predict some outcomes for one of our apps. I'm trying to explain why we're not there yet, like the fact that our data infrastructure is undergoing a major overhaul and it's shaky AF, the fact that leadership won't let us hire an ML engineer but that we can ""take some of the 60 ML courses that AWS offers.  


I see posts here all the time from disgruntled data scientists and ML engineers who complain about organizations wanting that information but not investing and understanding what it is, and is not. Or spending their time on the data engineering side of things and less time training and tuning models.  


Don't get me wrong, I would love to dink around all day trying to train models. But we're not there yet in terms of data maturity. We're still in the phase of trying to understand what has happened ,never mind trying to show our customers the likelihood that specific events could happen.

But recently I got a job offer from a Silicon Valley AI and ML startup. This start up has an intense five-month training program at the beginning of the job, where I would be taught all the AI and ML I'll need, and of course after I work on projects I'll gain experience, so even though it is a job it also presents a huge learning opportunity maybe even better than the one of the masters. 

I want to have a career in DS and there are two choices: either take the job, work there for a couple of years and then pursue my masters. Or do my masters next winter semester as planned and look for a job in Germany only after being done with the master. Which one do you suggest? 

Some additional information:
-The job is remote so I would be pretty much staying at my parent's house if I take the offer. And I would begin the training program in March 
-I have various master options because some of the colleges in Germany have pretty strict requisites that don't allow people to change career paths just like that. And even though I studied an engineering I didn't formally take the DS classes that are requisites for getting into the masters. In this sense, maybe the job experience in the field can help me get a spot easier later but is not sure because germans love rules. In any case, I have found 2 masters in which I can get in without problem 
-I know Python but I wouldn't say I'm an expert. Asides from the Andrew Ng's course on ML I don't know anything else about DS
-I want to live in another country 
-I have to take a loan in order to do my masters in Germany. I ran some numbers and if I save 70% of the salary I'd have in the start up during two years, I can reduce the loan by 33%
-I'm fairly young, 23
-I speak English fluently and my German is around B2

Background: Have been working at a multifaceted company as a DS for more than a year now. I have built pipelines for fetching, transforming, and ingesting data coming from various API sources over time, and I liked it all. 

About a month ago, I started to help people in the digital marketing department to analyse and understand the data from Fb/google campaigns they run for our clients (medium to large enterprises). 

Now I don't have any prior experience in marketing analytics but was still able to help in identifying best/worst performing campaigns/adsets, age-groups and regions. This enabled them to tailor the campaign targetings and optimise the spendings to meet the KPI goals (e.g.CPA/CAC, leads, purchases, ROI,etc.).

2376,datascience,5 Python tricks to be more productive,"# 1. Using Underscores in Numeric Literals

    a = 1000000000
    # Is variable a billion or 100 millions?
    
    # Let's use underscores to make it easier to read
    a = 1_000_000_000
    
    # You can group numbers as you like
    b = 1_0_9_0

From Python 3.6 (and onwards) you can use underscores to make numbers easier to read. See[ PEP 515](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0515/) for more details.

# 2. Magic commands with IPython

My development workflow with Python is to have a terminal pane with neovim on the left and IPython interpreter on the right.

This makes testing the code easier as I can copy the code from the left and paste it in the interpreter on the right.

**What is the easiest way to paste the code to the IPython interpreter from the clipboard?**

Did you know that IPython supports magic commands?

One of them is the %paste command, which pastes the code from the clipboard with formating.

Simply type %paste in the IPython interpreter.

# 3. Using Pathlib

Working with paths can be challenging especially if your code needs to run on multiple operating systems.

    from pathlib import Path
    
    path = Path(""some_folder"")
    print(path)
    # output: some_folder
    
    # We can add more subfolders in a readable way
    path = path / ""sub_folter"" / ""sub_sub_folder""
    print(path)
    # output: some_folder/sub_folter/sub_sub_folder
    
    # make path absolute
    print(path.resolve())
    # output: /Users/r.orac/some_folder/sub_folter/sub_sub_folder

Luckily for us, Python standard library has [pathllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).

I work as data analyst and most of my working time I create queries in SQL, either for analysis or data selections (mostly for marketing purposes). I have been using it for 2 years and I would define myself as independent user / almost advanced. However, I have never used the tool ""SQL Reporting Services"" and I am wondering if I should learn it or focus on BI tools like Power BI?

Many jobs out there require some BI tool like Power BI. / Tableau... Why? Is it because many Business Analysts know little about programming in SQL? or is it because it is easy to use... or why? If I want to improve myself as Data Analyst, what should I focus on? Some Business Intelligence Tool like Power BI or SQL Reporting Services? Pros and cons?"
2392,datascience,"Seriously, how am I expected to grow in a profession where everyone discourages me from building anything non-trivial","**TL;DR:** switched from software engineering to data science 3 years ago looking for a more challenging career. Have had zero technical growth since then. Looking for a way out.

Myself: in my late 20s, started my career as a software engineer (2 YOE), then did a Masters in DS and have spent another 3 years since then as a data scientist (had one job in a mid-size startup and another one in a late-stage startup).

As a SWE, I wanted to switch to data science to have a more intellectually stimulating and rewarding job. Somehow I had this idea that DS would make it possible for me to pair my SWE skills with passion for maths, and I was really looking forward to lots of technical growth and exciting projects. Thinking now that this may have been my biggest career mistake so far as it's been the exact opposite.

Every single senior colleague I've been working with has been explicitly discouraging me from building anything more complex than a logistic regression, and usually suggested that I should implement some simple SQL / if-else solution instead. In fact, 90% of my job has always been data lackey work answering silly ad-hoc questions from stakeholders using SQL or basic pandas. I feel like I haven't learned anything in the last 3 years except for tons of non-transferrable domain knowledge that I deeply don't care about.

I totally get it that as a data scientist, I am expected to provide business value - and not build fancy models. It is just that I no longer see how I can pair being useful with having at least some benefits for my career and technical growth.

I once had this guy on my team who was complaining a lot about DS applicants he was interviewing back then. His problem was with them mentioning ""passion for neural networks"" on their CVs and not being ""down to earth"" enough. The guy then went on to change teams to work as a front-end developer and learn all the fancy React stuff, and then switched teams again to do backend engineering, learn yet another language and use his new skills to tackle some really cool problems.

Like wow, it almost feels as if people in this industry sincerely believe it is okay for a software engineer to keep learning and have lots of technical growth, whereas a data scientist is expected to know their place and be stuck doing SQL / occasionally treat themselves to some very basic ML.

I guess there are some DS positions out there that are not like that but they seem to be incredibly rare, and it feels like every year of this sort of ""experience"" makes it less and less likely for me to ever get into real ML as the market feels so competitive.

I am thinking that I should go back to software engineering while it's not too late. Have some of you guys been in a similar position? What do you think?"

2401,datascience,I'm deploying my first data science app...need help determining my cloud stack,"Hi all, I recently posted about my initial experience with deploying an XGBoost predictive model. After some reflection I realized that I have no idea what my cloud architecture looks like! So I wanted to get your opinions about what technologies I need to realize this app. Here are its features:

1. Users input either: details about an apartment; or a Craigslist link
2. Details are preprocessed and converted to a feature vector
3. An XGBoost model predicts the price of the rental unit
4. The prediction is served to the user
5. Data is scraped from Craigslist's most recent daily results, and added to a datastore
6. The XGBoost model is retained with the new data each day (via batch processing)

I am interested in leveraging AWS's resources to deploy this app. My questions right now are:

1. Right now the data exists in a pickled dataframe (glorified spreadsheet). There is a field in the raw data that is a list of dictionaries, and I don't know how that would be supported in a RDBMS. Do I need to offshore my data to a database, or is there something more lightweight that I can use to house my data? Keep in mind there is no relational data in this project, it basically uses one spreadsheet.
2. Can I use a Docker Container to deploy my app based on the features above?
3. What do I use to host my front end? S3? ec2? Is the front end part of the container and is included in the Fargate/ECS part of the stack?

Thanks in advance for your feedback everyone, it is really appreciated and valued."

I will then use the scraped data to develop a model and ultimately build a little web app that makes predictions. 

I have already made the web scraper, I have built a Flask API before, and I know how to do the modeling. What I don't understand is how to set up the database to be persistent and hosted? I have the scraper working and writing to a postgres database locally, but I am struggling to figure out how to move this local process to a hosted environment. 

I would ideally like to use AWS to get experience using AWS. I am not working with very much data (thousands of observations) and I am not opposed to paying a small amount monthly for the services.

I have researched AWS S3 and I understand that this is basic storage. But I dump a postgres database there I can't actually connect to it can I?

I know that AWS has a RDS service, is this what people normally use? I basically just want to be able to pull data and write to a database hosted online somewhere rather than storing everything locally. All the tutorials I read always gloss over this step.

2435,datascience,Where to start,"Disclaimer up front: I'm not a data scientist, I'm an analyst who has some programming knowledge and knows how to turn data into pretty graphs and metrics in PowerBI, excel, and access.

I've been struggling in two areas in my efforts to move away from manually importing and reducing my data. The first is importing the data, i have a lot of data coming in different formats and table structures, but largely the same information. If I had a UI that could read a file, ask the user to identify specific fields on the first import, and from then on  import with a ""one button press"", that would be super helpful. Currently I use Access saved imports, but those are a pain to set up, break easily, and have to be set up individually for each new data source.

Which brings me to the second area that I've struggled with. I've been using various incarnations of a split access database as both the UI for data entry and data storage. I have no idea what the best database/UI solution is, but I know access isn't it.

I'll take any advice I can get. Thanks"
2436,datascience,Runtime analysis in data science interviews,"Hello, currently an undergrad here whose majoring in statistics and minoring in computer science. So far I‚Äôve taken general software courses in java, covering basic data structures (queue, stacks, maps,) and algorithms applying those (linkedlists, binary search, hashing) etc. however along with those I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúfoundations of discrete structures‚Äù course, which is less coding and more so stuff about algorithmic analysis and runtime analysis. Recurrence relations and writing expressions of for and while loops to understand the runtime of them and do big O and omega analysis. Anyways, I‚Äôve found out I am very bad at this stuff, and well legitimately failed a midterm with it. So my question is, how much runtime analysis is asked in data science interviews? Or is this more so in ML engineering positions? Should this be something I have to practice this in order to apply for internships ?"

2448,datascience,Best python packages for marketing / customer / transaction datasets? I have added some of my own suggestions. Looking for more.,"As part of my job I'm swamped in transaction &amp; customer data all day. This has led me to seek out python packages that are suited to these sorts of datasets. Here's what I've found. Would love some more recommendations if there are any. 

My data basically looks like this: 

&amp;#x200B;

**Transactions**

&amp;#x200B;

|customer\_id|store|spend|date|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|xyz456|KFC|$20|02/02/2020|
|abc23|McDonalds|$50|01/01/2020|

&amp;#x200B;

**Customer Data**

&amp;#x200B;

|customer\_id|address|age|gender|other\_demographics|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|xyz456|12 Main Street|23|M|estimated wealth info etc.|
|abc23|15 Other Street|34|F|census info etc.|

&amp;#x200B;

And I've found the following packages that suit data like this:

&amp;#x200B;

**Lifetimes**

Churn analysis, predict number of purchases, predict customer lifetime value. The number of purchases and lifetime value aren't very accurate in my tests. Churn analysis is pretty good and extremely lightweight and simple. 

[https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes)

&amp;#x200B;

**ML Extend**

I've used it for Association Rule mining. It's used to find shopping patterns i.e. eggs are often bought with flour and milk. 

I've re-jigged it to find common demographic patterns in relation to stores. e.g. McDonalds customers are often 24 year old males. 

[http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/](http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/)

&amp;#x200B;

**Facebook Prophet**

Time Series forecasting. 

Not really impressed with time series in general. I can usually just draw an upwards trending line on the chart with crayon and get the same result. Although I've never really studied them in great detail. Just playing along with the documentation. 

[https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick\_start.html#python-api](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html#python-api)

&amp;#x200B;

**RFM Modeling**

Segment your customers based on how much they spend, how often and how recently. Useful for finding your ""champion"" customers, or people who may be slipping away into churning and need attention.

[https://github.com/zark-stark12/crm-rfm-modeling](https://github.com/zark-stark12/crm-rfm-modeling)

&amp;#x200B;

**Implicit**

Recommender system. Seems to work well. Quite good at finding similar stores / products. e.g. give it deliveroo and it will spit out other take away fast food companies and .. Netflix? Pizza and movie night maybe? Some interesting results. 

[https://github.com/benfred/implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit)

&amp;#x200B;

Any other interesting packages related to customer data / marketing?"

2455,datascience,"A whole year from now to start applying to DS jobs. I'm in a good situation. I can choose what skills to improve, and I'm sure your advice will be super helpful.","Hello everyone, I'm Julian, I have a PhD in physics and I started learning DS about 6 months ago. I'm not a native english speaker (sorry for any mistake). I'm now in a postdoc position for 1.5 more years, but I KNOW that I will quit doing research when this position finishes and I will migrate exclusively to Data Science.  I am a specialist in Sustainable Energy Planning, and I love the topic, so it will be my goal to apply DS to that area of expertise (not necessarily, but would be amazing).

The things is, I have a whole year from now to continue specializing in DS, which is great, and I would love to read your opinion on what I should focus.

So far, I finished the following courses/specializations:

* Machine Learning (Coursera, Andrew NG).
* Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera, [deeplearning.ai](https://deeplearning.ai)).
* Python for everybody Specialization (Coursera, U. Michigan).
* Applied DS with Python Specialization (Coursera, U. Michigan).

So I have a good theoretical understanding of the algorithms and why they work (mostly).

Projects:

* I applied a K-means algorithm to help a collegue distribute power bioplants across the area of our State, optimizing transport costs (Weiszfeld) and it works pretty well (it is one of the simplest algorithms out there anyway).
* I'm about to get a huge database of energy consumption (lots of variables) and climate variables from a town nearby. I will have some fun with that.

Next steps:

* I'm about to specialize a little more on SQL.
* I'm planning to do the Tensor Flow Specialization of Coursera.
* I will definetly re-learn some statistical concepts that I haven't used for a while.
* I should learn a lot more of Keras.

The doubts I have are:

* Should I learn R?
* Spark?
* Hadoop?
* Java?
* Scala?
* Tableau?
* AWS?
* Azure?
* Should I learn a lot more of Linux? I don't feel very comfortable working on scripts. Simply because I never had the neccesity to do so at large scale.

Of course, I will develop some personal projects, such as the mentioned above, but if you had to choose, what kind of projects would you focus on during this year?

THANKS A LOT! And I'm sorry for such along post."
2456,datascience,Meaning of the math behind Principal Component Analysis,"Hey, 

So I'm a fresher to datascience and lately I've been catching up on principal component analysis (PCA) and the math behind it. For anyone who is well versed in Linear Algebra, i have a question that's been itching in me. Now i know PCA is used to increase the Signal to Ratio, basically the information fed into our data. But the way to do so is little unclear. 

Firstly I went through the link [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mathematics-behind-principal-component-analysis-fff2d7f4b643) to understand what was happening. As a beginner in Linear Algebra, I understand what eigenvectors and eigenvalues are. Let me try to define it below, please let me know if I'm thinking straight:

&gt;Eigenvector is one, who when undergoing a Linear transformation through a matrix A will not change its orientation but only will be scaled by the eigenvalue. 

So in this aspect I was checking PCA, when it was mentioned we try to find the eighen vectors for Linear transformation given by the Covariance Matrix. Now this is where I have a hard time understanding the concept. Why are we seeing Covariance Matrix as a linear transformation, how does finding a vector that does not change its orientation and finding the eigenvalue help us here?

What are we trying to achieve by doing that? And is there any benefits in learning this particular mathematical concept? Or is it better to just leave it as it be and mug the concept?

I'd love some help as I'm unaware who to raise this question to. Hopefully I could find some help here. 

If its the wrong place to raise, please guide me as to where I can do so?

2485,datascience,Opportunities for Data Science Beginner,"Hi. I'm an undergrad who's currently taking a gap year (I've already completed my freshman year as a CS major and am now in the Class of 2024). I became very interested in data science/machine learning starting this summer, and have taken/am taking several online courses on the subject, as I've really tried to immerse myself in the field. 

I now find myself in a weird situation. I'm not yet experienced enough to have done meaningful projects, and am still in the process of learning the methods and the tech stack needed for producing valuable ML work (even though I do have some background in the basics of statistics, ML algorithms, and programming/computer science). However, at the same time, I've often felt lonely and in search of  meaningful work beyond self-studying Python/R/stats/ML on my own. 

Does anyone have any advice as to how I can get involved with a team working on a data-related project as somewhat of a beginner to the field? I know that is a very tough question, since  organizations will rationally opt for experts with years of experience and advanced skills over college sophomores who won't be able to produce  the same high quality work at the same speed. Thus, I understand if the answer is simply to keep on reading, learning through online courses,  participating in competitions, and working on personal projects. I will of course keep doing all of those.

However, I would really appreciate if anyone had any insight you think might be helpful to me. Specifically, I'd be very grateful for any pointers as to what resources I should look into for remote, unpaid data science-related teamwork opportunities/projects that might be available for college students like me without years of experience.

I've already looked into things like the DataCorps volunteering projects at [https://www.datakind.org/](https://www.datakind.org/), but I probably won't be qualified for those for at least several more months of self-studying/working on projects.

To end the post, I should clarify that I'm not looking for an ""easy way out"" of stuff like learning statistics, probability, machine learning, and ML/DS tools in-depth (and instead going straight to actual work in data science). I thoroughly enjoy doing all of those, and I \*will\* obviously keep working on all of them regardless of whether or not I get an opportunity to work on a project/with a team. I just want to break out of some of the monotony that comes from just grinding online courses/books/coding alone all day.

Thanks a ton for any advice!"

I have a project where I am analysing chat data from my personal conversation with my girlfriend. Since this is real data there are some explicit words which appear in the chat. No images just words.

Should I censor my data, or analyse it as is? Having discussed it with multiple persons I find both sides convincing; yes I asked my girlfriend if she would mind my making our results public - it's a non-issue.

1. It's real world data, present it coldly with no emotion as a scientist should/would.
2. It's unprofessional and personal, censor the data before analysis/after analysis for presentation.

2491,datascience,[D] I created a function (in R) that does cross validation grid search for different threshold levels - could someone please take a look at it and let me know if its mathematically correct?,"(Note: I tried to post this code on reddit for half an hour, but the formatting just wouldn't work. So i posted it on stackexchange)

Many machine learning algorithms (e.g. random forest) calculate a probability that a given observation belongs to a particular class (for classification problems). Usually, the threshold for this probability is 0.5 (e.g in a binary response problem: if the probability is greater than 0.5 it belongs to one class, if less than 0.5 it belongs to the other class). 

Modifying this probability threshold can sometimes significantly improve the performance of this model.

For the random forest model (using R), i tried to research a way such that different values of this probability classification threshold be also taken into consideration during the (k fold) cross validation grid search procedure ... but I couldn't find anything that exactly matched my requirements. So i spent a few days and tried to write my own function in R.

Could someone please take a look at it and let me know if its mathematically correct? I posted the link below:

2498,datascience,how to spot inconsistencies in large data sets?,"I'm  not even sure how to pose this question but it has to do with finding  inconsistencies in large data sets (relational tables). For example  (hypothetical), one table may cover the layout of a supermarket between  2018 and 2020 and the data is collected on a daily basis; one column may  include the location of a certain shelf (denoted using a code from 001  to 999). Another column may include the category of the products offered  on that shelf (for example, Canned Goods), and yet another may show the  revenue produced by the products on that particular shelf on that  particular day. What may happen, however, is that one day the store  manager decides to place some other set products on shelf number 004  thereby changing its category. I am not notified, nevertheless I can see  the date when the category on location 004 changed from x to y. The  manager may also add another shelf numbered 1000 or he may switch two shelves (i.e. their categories) or even remove certain shelves.

I  am wondering how I could check for such changes in a table that has  over 1M rows and around 30 columns. Going through the table row by row  is not going to cut it, I've tried various methods using Excel, Power Bi  (particularly power query), but I am looking for some neat algorithmic  way of doing this, preferably using SQL or Python or R. Ofcourse if DAX  or M had these capabilities that would be even better.

I  have all the current data regarding the layout of the store, but in  order to utilise the older data from two years ago, I must be able to  spot any changes. Otherwise, I am unable to derive any useful insights  from this data as its supposedly constant parameters are actually  changing from time to time.

2502,datascience,Composition vs Inheritance for statistical modeling,"Hi, 
I've had questions I couldn't find answers online to, recently. I'm not sure how to design a model I'm thinking of and I feel like there's zero guidance out there about software practices with modeling in mind.

I'm mainly interested in forecasting so those are the examples I'll use.
In most large Python projects, you'll find that inheritance is used, for scikit-learn or statsmodels, there's a maximum likelihood estimator or a BaseEstimator from which other classes will inherit and then it grows from there with additional classes when it's required.

I found another project where [they are using composition](https://github.com/MBrouns/timeseers/blob/master/src/timeseers/timeseries_model.py) instead and it makes more sense to me, each model is the sum of its parts instead of the end point of an inheritance scheme. 

Then I realized that I couldn't find good practices or at least pros/cons of software development for statistical models.

So I guess my question is what do you do in your job to keep the code clean and maintainable and how do you build the architecture of such projects?

Thanks"

Currently, my bot does not use any ""real"" models like neural networks, however I have still implemented logic for an AI to play the game. I've made some histograms to show how often my AI clients wins in 40 sets of 100 games against a bot that plays seemingly randomly, so it is absolutely data collection and analysis. 

In the future I hope to implement some sort of reinforcement learning model that learns its own strategies instead of hard-coded ones like I currently have. The post I have currently is about how I built the game, with later posts to come regarding the actual AI development. If you want to check out the post and/or repo here's the links!

I currently am using excel for fairly ‚Äúlarge‚Äù GPS data for a soccer team. It tracks 100+ metrics from the gps/accelerometer, and I‚Äôm creating reports for the sport coaching staff and athletic training staff.

Since excel isn‚Äôt truly a database, I‚Äôm looking to expand to a more appropriate way of working with, storing, analyzing and reporting the data. 

I have minor experience with Python, and slightly less with R. Are either of these useful for this type of work and would either be more useful?

For example, I‚Äôm doing things like rolling 7 or 28 day averages/standard deviations, exponentially weighted moving averages for workload monitoring and creating reports that print out or can be emailed as PDF‚Äôs. Can python or R do those things as smoothly as excel? And what recommendations would you have for storing data other than excel?

Ideally I‚Äôd like to have something thats recurring, and not have to rewrite a bunch of code every time I want a report, which is why excel is nice at the moment.

I have a binary classification problem and i am using the random forest algorithm. I ran random forest and grid search cv, and found an optimal value  for the hyperparameters (in this case, the number of variables to split on). 

It then occured to me, i should also try and see if altering the classification probability threshold will produce a better model.

To demonstrate my problem, i took the ""sonar"" dataset in R and forcefully made this dataset imbalanced by reducing one of the classes. I then wrote a function (in R) that performs k fold cross validation (taking into consideration different probability thresholds).

Here is the entire code for this process: https://shrib.com/#Chital8xqV6ja

I am now confused as to how to select ""the best"" threshold (lets assume the optimal hyperparameter was found to be 15). I spent the weekend reading about performance metrics (specific to class imbalance problems) such as f score, precision, sensitivity, etc...and i just too confused. I understand this is a subjective process: a certain threshold will maximize the correct classification of the minority class, another threshold will maximize the correct classification of the majority class and another certain threshold will maximize both classes.

Here are the results:

My main employer is now finally discovering the benefits of good analysis, and is looking to hire some data-scientists, but before they do that, they want to purchase a good, secure environment and toolset for them to work in (I work in government). 

The current plan is to effectively buy a bunch of dedicated data-science virtual machines, with a full Python/R stack to replace the aged machines we've got doing tableau dashboards etc.  

As a hobbyist, that seems to be something of an expensive way to work - buying each member of staff what is effectively a dedicated VM, rather than using the bespoke DS solutions from people like AWS/Azure etc (I've got some experience working in databricks and AzureML).  But I've never worked in a company that does this stuff properly!  So, what is the ""dream"" setup like?  What do you have?  Would you expect a dedicated machine/VM to work in, or something else?"

I am genuinly appalled by how clueless some departments are about their own data and processes, which of course means that anything predictive or prescriptive is out of the picture because the domain knowledge is so low.

Perhaps my wishes and desires were a bit too high, but I just feel like I have regressed compared to my studies were I frequently applied machine learning, statistical learning, and deep learning to tackle challenging tasks. 

Out of curiousity, how much modelling do some of you guys do on a daily basis? I am aware of the fact that 80% of our time should be spent data wrangling and preprocessing but currently I am spending all my time in SQL and have yet touched Python or R, which feels a bit disappointing.

P.S. As the field of Data Science is new, I am aware of the fact that the data scientist role is extremely ambigous (I.e. some companies seeing them as data analysts whereas others see them more like machine learning practitioners).

2523,datascience,How to come up with interesting ML/DS side projects,"I used to have a hard time coming up with interesting ML/DS side projects. The problem was that I was doing things backward: I started with a solution and then tried to find a problem for it.

From what I've seen, I'm not the only one doing this. See if you can identify yourself here:

1. You learn about the latest ML/DL algorithm and get all excited about it
2. You start looking for places where you can apply it
3. You struggle to come up with an original application. So you end up doing the same project everyone else is doing or dropping the project altogether.

When you learn something, it's tough to disregard the context where you learn about it. So coming up with new applications is hard. It's no wonder why there are so many Data Scientists trying to predict who survived in the Titanic.

I've learned that taking the opposite approach works better: start with the problem and then try to find a solution. This a lot easier. You focus on what genuinely interests you. And you boost your chances of coming up with something others may find interesting too

So, how can you do that? Here's a simple way of approaching it:

1. **Choose a question:** Come up with a question you could potentially solve with data.
2. **Find data:** Figure out if there's data you can use to solve that question.
3. **Adjust the question (if necessary):** If the data won't help you solve your question, see if a slightly modified question would work
4. **Choose an algorithm:** Choose an algorithm you could use to solve that question.
5. **If unhappy, start over:** If you are not happy with the results of step 3 or 4, go back to step 1.

That's all. It's simple, yet I've found it to be very effective.

This approach has worked quite well for me. For one of my recent projects I got over 300 interactions on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dylanjcastillo_python-datascience-machinelearning-activity-6678007595099332608-mu-1) during its launch, 40 starts on [GitHub](https://github.com/dylanjcastillo/twitter-sentiment-tracker), and hundreds visits to its [website](http://polituits.com/).

For that project I initially iterated on a couple of ideas until I landed on what I decided to build: 

1. **Choose a question:** How does the perception towards Spanish politicians change during the day?
2. **Find data:** I could use different sources like social media, forums, or comments on news sites. To contain the scope, I decided only to use data from twitter.
3. **Adjust the question (if necessary):** How does the perception towards Spanish politicians change during the day *on twitter*?
4. **Choose an algorithm:** Given the data's nature, I knew using an NLP algorithm was the right approach. In my case, I ended up using BERT.

Hope others may find this useful too. I'd be happy to hear your thoughts!"

2525,datascience,"I need some sort of direction, or guidance, mostly for research","Hello! I am currently in my final year of CS engineering undergrad, but I'll be honest, I hate core CS or IT. I know ""hate"" is a strong word, and that is why I use it. For the past three years, data science, ML, AI etc have been an escape for me. I just pursued whatever I was curious about and didn't worry much about it. And I am pretty good at it: I have a few \*good\* publications in my bag and I am very proud of myself for that. However, I don't know what I want to pursue in the future.

I am largely inclined towards doing research. I have a few reasons for that: I enjoy working in largely autonomous settings, which research has provided me until now. Further, I don't really think a 9-5 would give me joy (I could be wrong). But then again, saying that I want to pursue ""research"" is pretty vague. I don't have a niche, and I think that it is a good thing and a pretty normal thing at this age, especially during the uncertainty we are facing right now.

When people ask me where I see myself a few years later, I genuinely don't know the answer to that question. And I am fine with that: I'll figure out things as I go along. However, it would be a little comforting if I can see my options, or at least be aware of them. I have a 9-5 job offer which I am considering as a back-up in case I don't get any research related opportunities.

I have more familiarity with Python because of few academic projects I did in my Masters but my colleague who gave me the project uses R.
I will have no problem learning R as well.
 He told me I'm free to choose any language.
Right now I just have to play with the data and see it's potential. Should I use R or Python?
If it turns out to be a good model, we might even productionize it. My colleague is already productionizing his R project on some platform. Sorry I don't know the name of it.
Please advice."

I'm currently a MS in computer science student here in the US. My primary areas of study are data engineering and machine learning engineer. Today I saw on another thread about questions regarding  examples of R being use in prod. Below are some great resources below from companies like google and T-Mobile, where they put their R code into prod.

2545,datascience,How to get feature importance for correlated features?,"Suppose I want to predict probability of raining in the next hour and I have a bunch of features including the following 2 of the **most predictive** but **correlated** features

1. Amount of **sunlight** (cloudy before it rains so this number is low). 
2. Amount of **clouds**. Suppose this feature is slightly more predictive than the amount of sunlight

If I use logistic regression, my understanding that I'll still get unbiased estimates on the parameters but the standard error will be very high, and this makes interpreting the feature magnitudes useless.

Does random forest work better? For example, since in each iteration the tree choose a random subset of the feature, there is a probability that only 1 of the above 2 features are selected, and the tree will split on that feature.

If using RF, would both feature be shown as equally important? Since features are randomly selected when building trees? Or would amount of clouds be shown as more important, since when both features are selected it will use clouds over sunlight?

Any other way of solving this problem?

Thanks!"

2548,datascience,Anyone have any knowledge about employment at private universities? What kind of negotiation parameters can I expect?,"I'm about to negotiate an offer for a role at a well-known private research institution. Unfortunately, since it is private, there is very little data regarding salaries for my position at the university, and the data I have found seems to indicate a median salary a little less than the median of the area. 

I think most universities have a pay-grade system that is imposed on the staff at a university level, but since it's private these are not viewable to the public. Are other negotiation parameters such as bonuses and pto available, or is there really no room for negotiation and the offer you get is pretty rigid?"
2549,datascience,Is SAS really the best tool for SQL joining local tables with database tables?,"I've always looked down my nose at SAS but now I may pick it up again for one feature: its ability to easily query local files with SQL and efficiently join with tables in a database. With Proc SQL, I can join local files with database tables as if they were both in the database and cleanly have the result in local memory.

&amp;#x200B;

By comparison, Python and R dataframes must be queried with their own functions and syntax (numpy, pandas, tidyverse, etc) and joining with database tables involves either downloading the whole table / querying for a piece of it and loading it local memory, or writing a table definition and uploading the dataframe into the database. When uploading a data file into the database, SAS can even automatically generate column names and data types.

&amp;#x200B;

To me, SAS seems like the superior analytical tool for ease of use when the job requires lots of SQL and  munging. Though I would love to be proved wrong here."

Some strategies I've tried are:

* Averaging
* Resampling
* Aggregating and using violin plots or error bars
* Different graphing libraries

The problem with these solutions is that they can take a long time to build, and they ultimately remove some of the data points from the graphs which ""loses"" information. My stakeholders/customers are typically not a fan of this."

There is no doubt that my career was going great and I was making relatively good money with compare to my peers and colleagues.

Now the thing which is frustrating me, there is not many online resources and modelling where I can learn how I can use Machine learning and other Algorithms in Trading such as stocks and etc. I have been able to do data analysis on different data sets, but where should I be starting to learn about Quants or Machine learning trading in Finance.

2588,datascience,Question: Using Bayesian Optimization with Domain Reduction,"Hello,

I've been attempting to use BO to optimize a black box function, and started by using [https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization) 

I then switched to try to use the newer Facebook Ax library, thinking it would improve results. Unfortunately, it hasn't. In the BO python package above, there is a concept of ""Domain Reduction"", which when used with my black box function has been very successful in rapidly finding near optimal ranges for 26 parameters, some Choice and some Int/Float Range. I've linked it here:

[https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/bayes\_opt/domain\_reduction.py](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/bayes_opt/domain_reduction.py)  
[https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/domain\_reduction.ipynb](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/domain_reduction.ipynb)

I've tried running Ax on the same data, configured in a similar fashion without the ""Domain Reduction"" extra above, and gotten significantly worse results. My attempts were run with: Sobol 30 steps, 150 GPEI trials, as well as 250 trials. It never came close to optimizing the target.

I've been struggling to understand two things:

1. Is this somewhat already implemented (bounds tightening, domain reduction, in any sense) in the Ax project?
2. If not, what would be my best path to adding something like this within Ax?
3. Are there any better tools for my task?

Thanks everyone"

I have stronger communication and presentation skills than my coworkers though, which has made me consider product management. 

I've been recently thinking about product management, since it's a field that is less technical and I could find roles which manage machine learning projects. Yet, I don't want to give the coding up fully which is why I'm not so sure.

My concern is I'm not sure what would be good in my career long term -- I eventually want to move into management, but I'm not sure if data science management or product management of data science projects is a better path."

I ended up getting an entry level Statistician job at a Fortune 500 company. We're not working on anything cutting edge like in Silicon Valley but I learned alot from my amazing teammates. 3 years later and my official title is Data Scientist now. I know I can learn alot of these things by myself but at my workplace having a masters boosts your salary and they also pay for it. The problem is I am having trouble getting into a program. 

I applied to Georgia Tech's online analytics masters when I was 6 months into working for this company as a Statistician and was rejected. Before I applied I asked them if I have any shot at all of getting in due to my GPA and the advisor said I might have a chance because of my work experiences. I didnt get in and I have just been taking data science related courses at my former school. They have a program aimed at working professionals.

I mention all this because I am hoping someone can share their experiences getting into a masters program with a low undergrad GPA. Is it possible to get in a good program with a 2.6 GPA now that I have 3 years of work experience or should I wait longer. I don't want to ask my manager for another letter of recommendation until I am sure I can get in."

I started as a Data Science Researcher at a company that had no real connected data infrastructure, then I basically volunteered to build it all and the analytics. They made me Business Intelligence Developer II reasoning that I'm more technical than an analyst but I'm not doing any data science - just building pipelines, dashboards, and recommending improvements to data architecture (there is no data architect). 

At this point, I'm definitely a junior data scientist at best - I know a lot of theory but don't have a ton of experience applying concepts, and much of my work involves reporting on historical data. I have a lot of subject knowledge around social media, political science, economics, law, psychometrics, and behavioral psych - I might be considered a polymath - but my work barely scratches the surface. I'm really good at using R for packages and shiny dashboards, but not so great with python or the more advanced SQL queries. I don't even have a public git repo where I show off my code to potential recruiters. I do get paid $80+ which is nice.

My team is somewhat central to the organization's data. I'm in charge of creating requirements for most of our product data, recommending changes to product support, creating company-wide surveys, and have access to HR data. For a while, I was the go-to problem solver and de-facto team lead until a manager was hired over me - now I just seem to get tasked with dev work. Now that the data infrastructure is more or less coming together, my manager wants to use a cloud ready-tools like AWS Glue and Quicksight over establishing a real DS toolset.

I'd love to hear some advice on how to optimize my career from here. Choices seem to be to 

* **Stick it out**. The challenge here is that my manager is a real barrier to job satisfaction and advancement. I have very little autonomy, and all of my strategic input is shot down via manager telephone (e.g. ""I asked and the VPs said they don't want to do that"" or ""I asked our boss and they say to not have conversations with the other team to gather requirements for your proposal to fix their data model"").
* **Move on.** The challenge here is that my work experience makes me not a perfect fit for a lot of data science jobs. there aren't many jobs that I am both qualified for, and are broad enough to let me flex. I don't have and advance degree, I'm missing some languages, no clearance, no practical AI/ML/NLP/Regression experience. I've sent out several applications with no nibbles.

I am confident I can get there, I just don't know where I should be going or what to expect. Has anyone made it through a similar situation? What should I learn or look into?"

I also currently use VSCode for process automation tasks.

Working in the internal IT side looking out I see lots of demand for data science in our other business areas. I am looking to start learning more about that side not so much to be a full data science role but to have to have enough knowledge to be a knowledge support on the IT side.

To achieve this, I plan to develop a series of projects in Kaggle, build out an inventory of tools to share on Git. I also plan to find new ways to implement ML or DL concepts in my present work using existing raw data, potentially including image data. 

 In my work, we work closely with a GIS team who curates our department‚Äôs geospatial data in ArcGIS. I am developing proficiency in Esri tools. 

 At this time, I am weighing the value of doubling down on filling gaps in my math education vs. developing stronger skills in Python/R/SQL. Or both on a longer timeline.

 How valuable is it to use time to address this skill-gap? Taking college-level courses in calculus, multi-variable calculus, linear algebra and discrete math for example will take many years. 

 Realistically, I am at the beginning of this journey. I have a bachelors with a major in Anthropology with some focus in Archaeology, but I do not have a strong background in analytics. Although I can work through data science concepts and use data science tools on the computer, I suspect mathematical education to be a major hurdle. 

 I‚Äôm open to suggestions and know that any strong path forward will take a few years. I‚Äôm prepared to do the work but need to find the best way to optimize my time. 

 I am not opposed to doing master‚Äôs work, but I want to make sure my ducks are in a row and find the right program. Here are some details about my current credentials:

\-  Bachelors in Anthropology with a focus in Archaeology 

\-  Three years‚Äô employment in a Grant Manager/Digital Resource Manager role in Nonprofit

\-  Current one years‚Äô employment in a Data Analyst role in Gov‚Äôt

\-  Developing proficiency in Special Data Science

o  Took Esri‚Äôs Spatial Data Science MOOC

 Is Data Science a realistic path forward? Is there another disciple that might make more sense to pursue that would better capitalize on my skills, like Geoanalytics? Should I prioritize math or computer learning?

I showed interest in getting involved and me and one other engineer have been scheduled to get some training on this platform that can do analytics for process manufacturing. The tool can integrate with python, C#, MATLAB and has built in ML methods. We have another engineer who will take care of the data management side while I can focus on developing analytics.

Originally, I was planning to get an MBA but with this recent opportunity, I've been considering continuing my career down this path to be a technical consultant.

How can I leverage this opportunity best? I have some advanced applied math knowledge from graduate classes I took as an undergrad (think numerical methods for optimization, non-linear dynamics, etc). I think my strong math background will help but I think having a master's might be better because I think I'd want to be a consultant long term so having some credentials might help. Any suggestions on graduate school programs I can do while working?

2630,datascience,Handling hardware demands for DS work/projects,"Hello,

So currently I am working as a data scientist and started studying again on top.
Apparently, I have total chaos at home now regarding hardware.

Company guidelines allow me to do testing and prototyping on private hardware (which I do, as I have it available and it is way faster than asking IT for Ressources every time).

Currently I have a small Xeon server running Ubuntu with docker and a jupyter server, a private workstation laptop (heavy and clumsy), an powerful windows desktop, a Mac mini by my company, a laptop by my company, and an private iPad Pro (‚Äûlaptop replacement‚Äú).

The result is total chaos. Data of my private projects gets cluttered everywhere, I sometimes hook up laptops to docking stations even if I would need the power of the desktop as I don‚Äôt want to waste time setting up virtual Python environments over and over again, and so on.

And I feel like it‚Äôs becoming more and more of a problem as my work and studying evolves. Sometimes I just need to setup an entire new Hadoop or Spark System for testing or a few databases or whatever.

So I am thinking about what to do. I thought about upgrading my server and only rely on the server and a thin and light ‚Äûdumb terminal‚Äú-Laptop. But it would be a lot of work managing, maybe expensive, and impair my work on the go as I have to work in environments where it is often simply not possible to connect to my home VPN.

The point is basically that I overall don‚Äôt need much for the most time. Python, maybe a jupyter Notebook, and that‚Äôs it. But I often stumble on points where I just suddenly need a GPU for CUDA or a few databases or a few virtual machines. And evertime one of those needs comes up I have to move my entire work up until that point from the more mobile but weak to the more static but powerful hardware (iPad -&gt; Laptop -&gt; Desktop &lt;-&gt; Server).

Another alternative I was thinking about getting an thin and light Laptop with not much power and and an mediocre desktop at home that‚Äôs just there to have a lot of storage and connect to multiple displays. I could then maybe run every project (like a single node Spark System or Django development) in an public cloud environment like on an AWS machine. This would skip the migration step from one of my hardware pieces to another and save me a lot of time and headache.
But this implys a long term problem. It would be expensive to pay the upkeep of every single instance that‚Äôs not needed at the moment. So I would need a way to archive an entire cloud machine locally in case I need the work maybe months later again.
I have no idea if AWS or anything provided this ability or if this idea makes financially any sense at all.

So how do you handle the hardware demands for your data science (especially data engineering) needs? Where do you prototype and test for maybe personal projects and how do you treat your work to not loose anything in the long run and can reuse it?
Any experiences with the ideas I had?

Every input, suggestion or idea highly appreciated.
Thanks for reading and have a great weekend."

I did a DS bootcamp and didn't cover any math at all, which was surprising, we were able to do all the modeling using python libraries. 

I've heard math is a big portion of data science, but where does it really come into play? Like do you create the equations for your own models instead of using scikit? I'm not too sure which area in data science I want to go towards, I really enjoy using data to make business decisions and transformations, and machine learning looks super fun too. I'm less interested in academic research and math, so I want to make sure ds is still the right career for me.

I worked at a large company that brought in Palantir to take over the entire data ecosystem (warehousing/ETL/dashboarding/ML pipelines/etc etc) and saw quite a few people leave in no small part due to the difficulties faced when working in Foundry, their product for the private sector. Granted, any fundamental change in the way a department functions is sure to ruffle feathers, but from my experience, Palantir was a whole lot of tech smoke and mirrors for what is essentially Accenture/Capgemini/IBM consulting services + a slick UI on top of a shoddy product.

Problems in data science workflows include:

\-Minimal support for non-Spark workloads meant a lot of legacy production code written in R or pandas-based Python had to be translated (with additional vendor costs to do this work).

\-Lots of time lost to debugging since a lot of errors are platform-specific and cannot be solved without one of Palantir's ""forward deployed engineers"" forwarding an issue to their product team, who relay back potential solutions. 

\-Lack of data science expertise in the on-site Palantir team meant a similar kind of back and forth with off-site product team.

\-For dashboarding, you're limited to the features provided on their Slate application

\-Query/code performance hampered by platform specific overhead

Curious to know about others' experience working with Palantir."

2655,datascience,How is Python easier than R?,"I come from a more statistical background but I was in BME before that and I just can‚Äôt see it. 

Yea I understand Python has scikit and Tensorflow/Keras. Scikit is easier than for example caret in R. And Keras makes DL easy too. 

However, for any general data analysis and manipulation Python feels way harder. Before even doing a linear regression I have to know wtf a ‚Äúclass‚Äù object is and how it works. I don‚Äôt think in terms of classes and OOP at all. I think more mathematically. (I did get used to this part of Python now but it took longer and I am still not good with making my own class) 

Compare that to R where literally on day 1 of using it I can figure out how to use lm() and glm(). I don‚Äôt need to know any OOP. 

Then pandas is another hellhole. Can‚Äôt figure out how to nest the dataframe easily by a group so that I can resample within a group for every group type thing and when I look it up I get a bunch of solutions pointing to using dictionary and iterators etc. Also the whole .loc and .iloc differences and indexing becomes annoying.

Without CS knowledge R is FAR FAR easier. I can literally get right into the analysis without learning all this overhead about data structures and class objects. Data manipulation is so easy with dplyr and purrr and the %&gt;%. 

Maybe for unstructured data like images/NLP and deep learning Python might be better but all the data I deal with is tabular. For unstructured data you need some CS knowledge anyways. But for a typical beginner I just can‚Äôt see how Python is any easier to do data analysis or manipulation in. Especially if you want to focus on understanding the math/stat concepts."

I don't have practically any technical skills at the moment. My school claims that they would give me a practical experience with top companies, through projects but I'm scared I might not be a top pick as a historian.

In clustering, it seems that when using Gaussian Mixture Models, we ""learn"" the clusters using Expectation Maximization.

What I've been able to find on this topic is quite limited, at least in terms of layman explanation.

Why isn't it possible to learn the centroids positions and variance using regular gradient descent? Is it inherently because this problem is unsupervised? Or is it because somehow the problem is ""not tractable"" in higher dimensions? 

I'm quite confused actually as to when an algorithm sometimes required to be ""trained"" using EM when it would seem more natural to used gradient descent. Conversely, can classification tasks with a convex loss to minimize be trained using EM ?

I would love to get some input regarding some concerns I have about entering the data science field. Currently, I am looking at enrolling on a MSc in Data Science. The course looks very interesting. Here are some of the modules covered for those of you that may be interested;

\- Machine Learning

\- Big Data

\- Neural Computing

\- Visual Analytics 

with electives in Cloud and Deep learning.

The university that offers this programme is known for its preference towards applied learning and implementation in industry, and less of a focus on the mathematical/statistical side of data science. 

Anyway, I have been doing a lot of research for the kinds of roles this course would prepare me for, as well as trying to get a grasp from current data scientists about what they do on a daily basis in their roles. Many people say that unless you have a strong understanding of mathematics, you wont progress in data science. How true is this? I ask because I have a much greater interest in applying tools to manipulate data to tell a story, or advise a company what course of action to take based on what the data is telling me, rather than creating complex algorithms and models to solve a complex issue. Is there a feasible role for me in the field where I can achieve this? I have a feeling this may be more of a data analyst role, but correct me if I am wrong.

So I wanted to know what was the right thing to do, should I stop learning ML for now or is there still somewhere I can use my skills at this stage?

2668,datascience,Feedback Requested: Checklist for a project contract,"Hey folks,

I don't have a lot of experience writing blog posts, so I would like to bounce it off you good people here, before I start posting on my own website. Feedback very much appreciated:


**Things to consider when negotiating a contract for a data science project**

When you are facing your first data science project and the accompanying negotiation of a project contract, it can be a little bit overwhelming and it's easy to forget to pen down some important issues.  In this article I will provide a list of some of these issues that should be defined in a data science project contract - and a few things that should not.

**Form and Content of the Result**

To manage expectations on the client's side, define the deliverables precisely, such as 

**the goal, e.g.**  

* identify factors on the website that influence the average shopping cart volume
* decide if the any of the 5 marketing campaigns of last year had a measurable impact on the revenue and if so, how much
* analyze if the customer retention measures in the call center are generating positive returns
* ...

**the format, e.g.**

* Powerpoint
* Word
* notebook
* Airflow workflow
* key-ready application
* daily mail reports
* ...


**the content, e.g.**

* one off analysis
* model for continuous evaluation
* table or visualization
* the timeframe of data to be analyzed and - if applicable - the timeframes for forecasts
* ...

**the timing**

* a.k.a. the deadline

**Wrangling the input data**

This is one of the trickiest ones, because part of why you are negotiating a data science project right now might be that your client does not have a very good overview over his own data landscape. Doctors can't blame their patients for being sick. But to the extent of your client's knowledge do define the rough size and shape of the data provided to you and their accessibility:

* millions of rows
* GB size
* remote access or on site only
* DB/DWH downtimes
* ETL processes blocking you from access (my last project DWH was down for one hour after lunch break for ETL)
* ...

Also include in your contract a passage that allows you to re-negotiate or get out of the contract after having an in-depth look at the data, as there are many potential, unforeseeable hiccups along the way that are neither your fault, nor your contract partner's. 


**You will be paid for your time, not the impact of your results**

There is no guarantee that you will find any result of substance and economical impact in an exploratory data science project. If you want to explore which factors influence the shopping cart value of a customer, it is entirely possible that the input data set does not contain any answers to your question. Any impactful factors that you happen to identify might already be at their optimum or cannot be adjusted for reasons outside the scope of your analysis. Mention in your contract that you do not owe any specific result and that your compensation is for the time and effort of the process, not the efficacy of your results. 



**Do not present preliminary results, avoid presenting your results many times over**

Do not agree on presenting intermediate results without giving great thought to it. Preparing a shiny presentation to placate a sceptical customer after a week or two of work will take focus away from your final result. Preparing the presentation of the result can take between 30 - 50 % of the overall man hours of a project, so if you want to present results after two weeks, you will barely have a week to do the actual work, if at all. Also, this can backfire if you decide to pursue a different angle to solve a problem after presenting preliminary results on a different route.

Oftentimes, the client simply wants to be kept in the loop to avoid wasting the money they invest in you. You can offer to communicate regular status updates via Email or chat and you should keep those memos neutral in terms of results to avoid eating your words later, e.g. write ""Explored - among other variables - the customers age in relation to the revenue"" instead of ""Looks like older customers spend more money in your shop"".

Once you find interesting results worthy of presentation, there might be a cascade of ""oh, the Head of Marketing needs to see that"", ""oh, the COO needs to see that"", ""oh, the CEO needs to see that"". This, of course, means for you that you will be spending more time than expected on the project, because you do not present the results once but 3 or 4 times. Stating in your contract that the results will be presented once and once only will give you leverage, should the client ask you to do more than one presentation or discussion of the results. 

**Access to subject matter experts**

While I suggest keeping the C-Level stakeholders on a ""need to know""-basis, I do recommend to keep in close contact with the client's side subject matter experts, as you will have questions that need answers. Everyone needs a vacation once in a while, but it is most inconvenient if your contacts within the client's organization are taking that long overdue holiday in the middle of your project. So, make sure you know when they will be present and that they are not constantly beleagured with meetings or vacations, but will actually be available to discuss your ideas and findings. 


**Hardware provided or BYOD**

If your client is providing you with hardware and you don't bring your own device, make sure it's fast and has sufficient RAM. The minimum nowadays should be 16 GB RAM for batch processing of any significant amount of data. Of course the price of RAM is minute compared to the overall budget of the average project and enough RAM to avoid swapping to disk can save you hours if not days over the course of a larger project.


**Third Party Tools**

If you want to rely on a 3rd party tools - especially when data is uploaded to their servers - make sure you are allowed to do so and it's within the infosec guidelines of your client.

**Minimize PII**

If anyhow possible, do not accept any personally identifiable information. You don't want to be involved if, at any point, there is a data breach and customer information get's leaked. You cannot leak or lose what you do not have.


**Checklist**

* Form and content of the final result is defined
* Document size, shape, and scope of data that will be provided to you
* Add a disclaimer about the exploratory nature of the data science project if applicable
* Define a predetermined breaking point after initial look into the data 
* Not agreed on any preliminary result meetings
* How many times the results will be presented 
* Your compensation for your efforts is defined
* Which hardware will be provided (if applicable) is defined
* Define which third party tools you want to use and get them signed off by infosec
* Define which PII is excluded from the data provided to you
* Access to subject matter experts is defined and any planned absences have been communicated"

This post might get long, really sorry for that. I am currently an Undergrad student in his third year double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. As the data science/analyst field is quite ambiguous, it's getting very difficult for me to figure out any career path. For eg. I always feel that I need to know something more to apply anywhere OR I find various job postings/internships with the same name BUT with a HUGE variety of pre-requisites/skills.

Honestly, this is making me quite mad and I am completely lost as to what I need to do now. I am not sure if this is the best way to go about it but my life cant seem to move anymore. So, below I have tried to put out a complete list of what I have majorly learnt at my university, course-wise. This list is obviously not exhaustive but I tried to include most of the seemingly important stuff.

So, I want to know what should I learn more before applying for internships (preferable role Data analyst)? Did I even learn anything significant? What kind of roles do I seem to be eligible for?

For the data analyst role, how should I begin? I have applied to many places (around 50) and haven't had a great experience with that. Is ""contacting nearby startups and asking for analyzing their data just for learning"" a viable strategy to break in the field?

2676,datascience,I am tired of being assessed as a 'software engineer' in job interviews.,"This is largely just a complaint post, but I am sure there are others here who feel the same way.

My job got Covid-19'd in March, and since then I have been back on the job search. The market is obviously at a low-point, and I get that, but what genuinely bothers me is that when I am applying for a Data Analyst, Data Scientist, or Machine Learning Engineering position, and am asked to fill out a timed online code assessment which was clearly meant for a typical software developer and not an analytics professional.

Yes, I use python for my job. That doesn't mean any test that employs python is a relevant assessment of my skills. It's a tool, and different jobs use different tools differently. Line cooks use knives, as do soldiers. But you wouldn't evaluate a line cook for a job on his ability to knife fight.

2683,datascience,I recently heard that Liverpool FC use advanced statistics and data science to predict the best position of players during attack. I'm just wondering if anyone can explain to me how this works?,"Here's the article:

2684,datascience,Looking for direction in my studies of Data Science and general advice,"Hello, I am a software engineer with a Bachelors in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics and about 1 year of work experience as a Data Engineer writing really simple ETL pipelines. I am interested in Data Science because i have always found math and statistics to be some of my favorite classes, and machine learning is very interesting to me.

So i started trying to learn Data science and i was wondering if you guys could take a look at what ive learned so far, and give me pointers, and answer some questions i had about my journey.

&amp;#x200B;

Courses I have used for study: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Python for Data Science and Machine Learning (Udemy) - Jose Portilla

\-NLP with Python (Udemy) -Jose Portilla

\- Stanford Machine learning  (Coursera)- Andrew NG

\- The Ultimate Hands-On Hadoop (udemy) -Frank Kane

\-Tableau 2020 A-Z (Udemy) -Kirill Eremenko

And i have read through an Introduction to Statistical Learning to reinforce the concepts i learned. 

&amp;#x200B;

So i have some questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1)  Do you think I would need to go back for my Masters or PH.D. Would you strongly suggest it? Or should i just keep applying for Junior Data Science positions until i get my foot in the door and go from there?

2) Where should i take my learning next? is there a topic im missing? Or should i be focusing in and reinforcing what I already have?

3) Ive been noticing that a lot of practical application of the machine learning topics are really abstracted. How important is deeply understanding the theory when the application is reduced to  only a few lines of code? How deep would you bother going on some of these topics before it becomes a waste of time?

4) given that Im a programmer, how in depth should i be going into Data Analytics skills? It seems to me like a Data Scientist is some mix of a Data Analyst and a Data Engineer. And my Engineering skills are most likely already on par with what they need to be. 

5) I want to start using Kaggle to practice, but i have no idea where to start (dont tell me the titanic one, ive done those easier classification  and linear regression problems.) But it would be nice to have a roadmap of sorts of the best kaggle competitions to really hit all of the different topics. Maybe thats a lot to ask."
2685,datascience,Are math and stats really not that important in data science?,"I'm a faculty member who teaches data science, and the discussion at https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i3o4fe/i_am_tired_of_being_assessed_as_a_software/ makes me very curious: **is there no need for math and stats in data science anymore? Or is my experience as a data analyst just oddly statistically driven (tons of hypothesis testing and statistical inference)?**

I teach an intro data science class, and if I need to emphasize the engineering skills more, I *will* learn the concepts from what I understand to be the best texts, can bring them into my class, and will. However, there's just way too much noise to sort through:

* Most undergraduate and graduate-level data science programs (and similarly-purposed programs, such as business analytics) I've seen do not require calculus I, even for admission to masters-level programs. **So does this mean that practitioners don't need to be aware of foundational concepts such as derivatives?**
* Some Big-10 programs I've seen go all out on the math: requiring multivariable calculus, two semesters of linear algebra, and about 2-3 semesters of algorithms at the undergraduate level and requiring this background prior to admission at the masters level
* Programs that I've seen, particularly at the undergraduate and masters level, *do not seem* to emphasize data cleansing - not to mention data engineering skills. There is an undergraduate-level program that I am aware of which covers *Introduction to Statistical Learning* (ISL) in one semester toward the end of the program. Do people really expect you to know the algorithms at the level of what is provided in ISL (which I add was clearly not meant for STEM majors), translate them to Python, and then start applying these concepts in the workforce? I have met people from this same undergraduate program who have never written a SQL query or learned what RegEx is. I have met people from this same program who have never heard of Google Cloud, Azure, or AWS.

As a faculty member who has also been a practitioner in industry, **I'm** frustrated trying to figure out what to best teach my students, and if I can't figure it out, I can't imagine having spent my whole career in academia and trying to learn this all on my own with textbooks. However, I want to make sure that whatever I teach will provide value to my students when they graduate. 

Any advice would be extremely helpful."
2686,datascience,"Got my very first data analyst interview coming in a couple of days, tips are extremely appreciated.","Hey everyone! Giving a very small summary:

I'm a chemical engineer, found a couple of very bad jobs and related to my field (either bad because of a toxic environment or because I didn't find the work fullfiling). 


I started doing data analysis in one of the positions i had and I loved it. During this quarantine I spent everyday learning sql, python, reading books and doing projects, and it worked! I have an interview for a data analysis position, but it's for a senior role (which I applied for knowing I wasn't going to get.... But here we are)

The role description feels like something I could be able to do (sql, python, a/b testing, multivariate, tableau or qlikview).


What kind of questions should I expect? Am I going to be asked how to program something in python out of the blue? (This is my first IT related interview and it's virgin territory for me).


Absolutely any tip you have for me is highly appreciated, I need this job to save my life from the misery I've been stuck in for a very long time now (even had to fled my country out of the economical crisis, now I'm working carrying 30 kg boxes in a warehouse, which is taking a toll on my back, and I'm just dying to be paid to work with anything data related, which for the first time in my life gave me a real passion for something work related)

2688,datascience,What should an aspiring Data Scientist be focusing on?,"I've been following this sub for a little while now, and have been left feeling a little out of my depth.

From people talking about the importance of a PhD and master Python skills, to why you should or shouldn't focus on ML, or why maths/stats is or isn't worthwhile. 

I've also seen people discuss things that are completely foreign to me (what the hell is Docker?).

Of course, there's also the non-technical skills, like knowing what questions to ask when posed with a problem, whet the right tests to use are, etc.

2689,datascience,What to do when seeing portfolios better than yours.,"I know, it‚Äôs scary. 

I remember job hunting and getting into kaggle to build my portfolio: inspecting kernels, recreating code, adding new pieces. It wasn‚Äôt until I came across kernels with insane coding. My heart sank, ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm not good enough.‚Äù

If you‚Äôve ever felt like this, let me share some advice: it‚Äôs all good. 

My portfolio, to this day, is still not an elite level. My kaggle account? Forget it. The value is in your work, and how much you respect it. No matter where you go, if you believe in your job, complete a project, and admire your hard efforts, it‚Äôs worth more than any amazing kernel. 

But what if you‚Äôre not there yet? Well, building a portfolio does help, and so does practicing. Here‚Äôs the catch: kaggle is geared towards the 10% of what a data scientist will spend their time on, and by that point, you won‚Äôt need a complex model ‚Äî well, that or the solution has specific constraints. 

I can tell you now, 80% of my work at my current job is simple and effective and I only get simpler. I spend more time finding more effective ways to work and understand my data to deliver easy solutions. on the plus side, they work really well! 

The next time you look at a kaggle kernel and feel overwhelmed. If your goal is to work in industry, then kaggle does not reflect this entirely. 

Additionally, as you spend most days doing the job you love, things will eventually click. I know it sounds a bit esoteric, but trust me... you‚Äôll feel a sense of comfort with the difficulty of problems. By this point, your portfolio writes itself. 

If your goal is to become a kaggle master, you‚Äôre probably the one submitting these incredible kernels, you smart genius you! 

Keep pushing! And always remember: life is hard, why make it more complex when easy works just fine! 

I really hope this helps and I look forward to reading your stories!"

I've been looking at some people's portfolios that they post online and the stuff I see in those portfolios look way more involved than anything I had to do for the bootcamp.

However, I tried the Titanic challenge on Kaggle and found that to be relatively easy-ish. I know it's considered an entry level dataset though. 

I'm not really sure if the portfolios I've seen are just way ahead of what I should be thinking of doing for an entry level job resume, or if I'm just that far away from being a desirable candidate."
2694,datascience,DS Undergraduate Internship,[removed]
2695,datascience,Looking for some DS career guidance,"Hi r/datascience. 

I've been struggling a lot with where to move in my career with regards to DS and I was hoping the kind community may help me a bit with the pickle of a situation i feel i'm in currently and hopefully can give me a bit of a pointer in the direction i should proceed in. 

Some background: 

I graduated ~4 years ago with a degree in Business and ended up at Fortune 100 company as a systems analyst. Over the years I ended up doing a bunch of business analyst stuff and my first exposure to coding was using pandas to automatically create some reports that was constantly being asked for. From there, I moved into a data analyst role where my main project was creating a nice dashboard around workforce planning and analytics. (reality is it was just tracking different metrics like who left for which managers etc in what period). Afterwards I moved to a security startup as a senior da doing reporting that later got acquired by a mid size company where my current title is data scientist (lol). 

Current: 

Right now a lot of my job right now consists of creating powerpoint reports in powerpoint and SQL. It just feels like an analyst role (which realistically I think it is beyond the title). I've been working on a python program that would automatically generate the reports, but outside of that I haven't really had any sort of experience to learn / utilize ML. 

Problem: 

I'm not really enjoying my current position. I'm nearly a year in and despite the current title or good performance evaluation, I don't consider or feel that I'm actually practicing DS. I don't really do A/B testing either and so I feel like I'm just a reporting bot at this point (that gets paid okay i guess for being a reporting bot). I don't have really have any stats background or ML experience, and so i've been studying on the side to try to enhance my knowledge.

The only thing I know in my career so far is that I like writing scripts that automate some pretty mind numbing work. 

I am hoping that by posting here maybe you guys could shed a bit of light in terms of what you guys would recommend me to do? Get a Masters?"

I am a final year undergrad from India. I spent my past year working on data science problems, reading Ml papers and implementing some of them. I am still exploring and learning many new things every day. I also started reading kaggle kernels daily and about to take kaggle competitions very serious.

I also should start apply for jobs and internships. My college personally have only SE based companies for placements but dont have any data science or ML related companies. So, I am planning to go off-campus. I have some queries - (1) Is it difficult for a fresher to get into datascience/ ML job (keeping COVID in mind)? (2) I am completely opposite to most of my classmates who spent their time on leetcode or codechef. I never had any competitive programming experience except a few i did on kaggle. Should I shift my focus to competitive programming just to get a job? (3) I know that data structures are important for any CS job but should I be very good at data structures and algorithms like implementing conplex algorithms on white board as in a traditional SE job interview? (4) Finally, What all should I focus on right now, to get into data science or ML job as a fresher?

ps: I'll be going to masters in US/UK after 2 years of job. So I need related work experience in data science and ML but not in SDE roles. :)"

There is no second chance, so if I fail I'll just gtfo with a masters and find a job in industry.

I'm reasonably good at math (not good enough to confidently pass the measure theoretic qual though) and have some basic knowledge of CS (data structures, algorithms, theory of computing), but have no experience coding in a professional setting.

I am also very unfamiliar with many tools commonly used in practice, such as SQL and git.

Is there anything that I should prioritize once it's clear I can't stay in the program anymore?

My current plan is to complete a few projects and take the following courses:

*Machine Learning* (I never formally learned ML)

*Data Management and Data Systems* (Sql and databases)

*Mining Massive Data Sets*

*Modern Applied Statistics: Learning &amp; Data Mining* (basically what's in the elements of statistical learning)

Some other courses I'm considering are:

*Convex Optimization*

*Causal Inference*

*Information Theory*

I am not sure if this is the appropriate sub to post this. Please let me know the correct sub to post this question to. Anyway, back to my question.

I am assuming that many of you are familiar with the [HUBZone](https://www.sba.gov/federal-contracting/contracting-assistance-programs/hubzone-program). There are designated areas in the US which are called HUB Zones. Small businesses located in these areas who are certified as a HUB Zone business get preference when Federal contracts are awarded. Now, the areas defined are in terms of census tracts, counties and Indian reservation lands. My goal is to see if socio-economic standards have improved over the past couple of years in those areas.

Now, the counties, census tracts and Indian lands overlap in many locations. If I can get the census tracts that comprise of all these regions, I can cover all the regions.

Now, coming to my problem. I can only get information of various indicators like GDP, income, etc at the county level. How can I get this at the census tract level? I am looking exclusively for census tract information as it is the smallest level of granularity and can effectively cover all the regions in the HUBZone (counties and Indian lands). 

If there is another approach, please advise."

2723,datascience,Suggestions for an ETL wayback machine,"Imagine running large ETLs, probably in Python, maybe with some pipeline framework (e.g. Airflow, Azure data factory, Luigi...), on a daily basis. Lots of stuff gets in, lots of processing happens, and some stuff gets out. ""Stuff"" is mostly big dataframes. Imagine this is done for a food delivery system, analysing daily revenues, making forecasts, optimising orders, etc.

After a while, someone notices that one particular number in one of the tables from the output generated a month ago doesn't make much sense. For example, for a single menu item from a single restaurant on a single day you forecasted zero sales although it's a very popular dish. You might have the exact version of the code, and of the input data from that point in time, so you might try running it again trying to trace this particular datapoint through the code, but it's a hassle. In fact, you know already that this problem probably occured because (a) you had wrong info that menu item is not available on that day or (b) that it's price was wrong skewing your demand forecast (e.g. your system thought that the item costs a million dollars). Both numbers (a) and (b) come from some other DAG components so you cannot just easily check your input data even if you still have it.

It would be great if you had a system where you might input something like ""What value V did we produce and why for item X at time T"", and have some kind of wayback machine give you a nice easy to read description of what happened. Obviously, your whole codebase would have to be developed with this in mind. One major issue is that storing all the intermediate data for (very very sparse) future lookups is quite inefficient. On the other hand, rerunning the code to see what happened (in some kind of ""analysis"" mode) might be hard to achieve, as reproducibility with large systems often is.

Are there any frameworks/libs you'd suggest which solve such issues? Are there any orchestration tools which already support something like this?

2726,datascience,Newbie question about overfitting/underfitting binary classifiers,"Lets say I want to find the best 'k' parameter to optimize a KNN algorithm whose goal is to classify a dataset into 2 groups (groups 'A' and 'B').

I decide that I will do a parameter search where I scan k from a range (say k\_0 to k\_f) and than calculate the area under the curve (AUC) for the subsequent ROC curves (presumably a different ROC curve for each k value). I get the different AUC values but now I want to know which k value is optimal (i.e. gives the best AUC value without overfitting/underfitting the data).

I've read online that traditionally people determine whether binary classifiers over/underfit by the following (using the KNN example here):

1. find a k value which would you would like to investigate.
2. use the model on the training set data and plot the ROC curve.
3. use the model on the test set data and  plot the ROC curve.
4. If there is a small gap between the training set ROC and test set ROC, you have not over/underfit the data. If no gap exists, your model overfits the data.

My questions:

Is my understanding correct about how to gauge over/underfitting for this example?

Usually, should the ROC curve for the test set be above or below the ROC curve for the training set? Or does it depend on the data you are working with?"

2728,datascience,tuning xgboost for AUC metric,"Hello everyone!

I participated in a Kaggle classroom competition months ago. It was over already. The goal is to predict whether it would rain based on the 14 features. Our professor told us that the data was pre-processed already and there was no need to do the feature selection anymore. In fact he didn't even tell us the meaning for each feature. The metric for this competition was AUC.

After tuning with GridSearch, Bayesian Optimization, I had a single xgboost model that could achieve AUC score with \~ 0.80, while it turned out that the 1st place got 0.81. I have searched online for the resources lately. I think an ensemble of xgboost doesn't work since xgboost itself is an ensemble of trees already. And indeed my weighted average or rank average of xgboost models were overfitting. The only thing that I found out working is the `scale_pos_weight` parameter since our data is imbalanced. All my other attempts failed, and I was never able to break the 0.80 cap.

Besides the feature selection (I know there is a whole lot more things around feature selection but let's ignore it for now), what are some other techniques or tricks that can boost the xgboost model, especially for the AUC metric? 

I would really appreciate it if anyone can drop some knowledge!!"

2758,datascience,"Mechanical engineer looking to get more into CS/data analysis work, and looking for direction based on interests","Like I say, been a mechanical engineer for about 5 years. Have always been most interested in the programming and data analysis aspects of my job more than the actual subject matter (oil and gas) so I would like to migrate towards a job more focused on that side of things. I've been looking at positions for Data Scientist, Data Engineer, Developer, etc. and am a bit lost about what type of position would be the best fit for my strengths and interests.

Quick rundown of my qualifications:
- Mainly work in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, etc.) or R (Tidyverse, GGplot, etc.), and MATLAB.
- I handle lots of raw data and spend a lot of time cleaning it up (which I really enjoy for some reason) and analysing it with pretty basic statistical methods.
- Lots of experience using Linux Bash, Git, Conda, and CLI stuff and SQL queries.

# Things I enjoy/gravitate towards:

**Automation**.
At my first job, I was obsessed with automating things. I would always try to automate all the frustrating or tedious tasks that people were doing, and that became my main passion. Watching people waste hours on manually copying and pasting Excel formulas across columns and thinking ""I bet I could figure out a way to do that faster"" was sort of my starting point. I started making Excel apps with VBA to create budget calculators, data aggregators, and stuff like that. That was the fun part of my job. The actual engineering subject matter was secondary in my mind, and I've always struggled with that (hence this post).

**Scripting/Reproduceability**.
I also love the concept of scripting everything. Switching to working primarily from Bash with scripts and command line queries has been a revelation. Same sort of thing with automating data processing tasks at work by setting up all the dependencies and targets in a Makefile. I like the feeling of having everything arranged properly so that it's clear how to get from A to B, and that the assumptions along the way are clear as well. Ad-hoc scripts and half-finished projects that are everywhere in engineering analyses pain me somewhat (not to say I don't do that same thing in a time crunch).

**Data Manipulation**.
Like I say, I really like knowing how to transform a raw set of data to something shiny and clean using either pandas or the tidyverse suite. This is fun.

**Graphic Design/UX**
I really like thinking up ways to improve the apps I use. There are a number of apps on my phone that I think about a lot, how I would arrange the features, what I would do to make it easier to use, faster to navigate, etc.

**Data analysis projects**.
I have done a few webscraping-to-plotting projects to look at things like housing prices by area, sports stats, word frequencies, etc. I really like this stuff too.


# What I don't know much about:

Despite all of the above interests, I've never gotten into Machine Learning stuff, though I am trying to do so. It all seems very daunting. Most job descriptions are asking for the world (Cloud experience, NoSQL, ML and AI algorithms, etc.) I don't even know where to begin since there is just a lot out there.

# TLDR

I am a mechanical engineer. I really like automating stuff, scripting stuff, cleaning/wrangling data, thinking about how to make stuff easy to use. My main exposure to programming is Python, R, Matlab, C++. Trying to figure out what kind of job would be a good fit if I were to gravitate to the CS / Data Analysis world. Any advice would be great or what I should be spending my time learning now to get somewhere."

2781,datascience,Coding Experience: Data Scientist vs. Software Engineer,"Hi everyone,

First time posting here so bear with me. 

I finished up graduate school in early 2019 with a degree in Epidemiology. My program was a hybrid between traditional stats and data science (specifically ML). This is where I learned python and various data science-related skills.

After grad school, I spent 6 months working as a data scientist in Silicon Valley and then switched to working in a think tank as a technical consultant (essentially a data scientist). My experience is mainly around building ML models on large data sets to answer specific policy questions.

My job required I get a US government clearance and a lot of the work I did was for various government agencies.

I reached out to a recruiter at a huge tech firm who told me she‚Äôd find a cleared data science role for me, but later insisted I apply as a software engineer because I have at least a year‚Äôs worth of programming experience.

I now have my final ‚Äúon-site‚Äù interview (virtual due to COVID-19) soon and I‚Äôm totally freaking out because as a data scientist, I‚Äôve never had to write code like a software engineer would; I write pragmatic code and never really had to think about time/space complexity or efficiency in the traditional sense. Also, because I‚Äôm coming into this from a non-CS background, I have no real understanding of common algorithms and struggle with medium difficulty leet-code type problems lol.

For clarity, the position requires at least one year of python and scripting experience (which I have), but it‚Äôs as a data scientist, not a software engineer. It also requires a government clearance (which I have).

Question: Do I have any shot of getting this position? Any data scientists out there currently occupying SWE roles? Should I withdraw my name from consideration and just wait for a data science role?

I am coming from a little less mathematically rigorous background.

Now I am starting MSc in a course where 40-50% of that course is just ML algorithms. I wanted to quickly review maths needed for ML as i know that's expected in this programme (Even though its the same university).

I looked into this course here:

[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning#courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning#courses) 

, but it seems like a joke. I went through the 1st course with linear algebra and it is just pure introduction. This whole 1st course is like 3 lectures in university... I am very sceptical to continue with it, especially that i have never studied PCA, i know that course 3 will be a waste of time for me.

Therefore I am looking for an advice for a course that covers same material to this, but actually something that dives just a little deeper and where i would challenge myself again. Last time i touched linear algebra as an example was 4 years ago so i had forgotten everything and don't feel like i remember much from this 1st part of the course.

I assume while starting I will take a pay cut as is the case with most changes in careers but data science definitely has a higher ceiling than my current role. So the questions I have are is data science actually a field where I could work remotely, is a 10 week crash course actually enough to land a job and how does everyone like their careers in data science. Thank you for any insight that you can share."

2801,datascience,Looking for suggestions on how I can display this data in a more readable format,"I feel like I make a lot of charts that look like [this](https://imgur.com/CPcdBLm). It‚Äôs usually a scenario where users can take either action A, B, C, or D (such that A+B+C+D=100% of possible actions), and I want to split it by some dimension (AM vs PM, New vs Existing User, etc). My go-to is a grouped + stacked bar chart like this, where the dimensions are grouped on the Y1 and Y2 axes and the X axis is the stacked bar chart with the percent of users who took each action each week. 

However this isn‚Äôt particularly readable. Does anyone have a better suggestion for how I can display this data in a more readable format?

Note that in my data viz tool (Periscope), users can select down to individual series by clicking on the legend (which I removed from the screenshot for privacy). So for example, a PM could select just the white and orange series (which in this case are New and Existing users that used a feature) and compare them head to head. That's the way I intend this chart to be used, but it's pretty overwhelming when you see all the series displayed together."

I'm currently pulling live data from   [https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) to create a model to predict new cases/new deaths. However, a TON of data is missing. and even when I go through the excel sheet it's not as if it's a uniform amount of small countries, its completely random and I'm at a loss for how to deal with this.

Somethings I haven't done but considered were grouping countries by continent and averaging out all their stats and applying it to the perspective columns although this may be disproportionate in places like the EU. To combat this I was going to limit the application to only countries with a population above X and total cases above Y. but then the problem with this is that there are a few small instances where certain days were just not reported and would skew the data in these instances.

Would love some input on how anyone else has dealt with missing data on this scale. Or if I'm going in the right direction."

 I'm a data science beginner who is looking to take on my first project. Essentially, I want to take catch data from the National Fisheries Organization to predict where fish are in their migration on a quarterly basis. 

However, I've run into my first roadblock in this project- inaccurate data. While there is enough data to work with, a lot of the reported catch numbers have a high PSE \[proporation standard of error\]. About \~50% of the data has a PSE of over 50, which makes me question whether the quality of this data will effect the overall integrity of this project. 

&amp;#x200B;

That being said, I've taken and am considering two measures in order to minimize the variance. 

1. I have lowered my sample size from 1980-present to 2000-present, as I found that the more recent records were more accurate. 
2. I'm considering removing the rows with high PSE \[over 50\], but am concerned that it may affect the overall integrity of the project given how many records have a PSE of over 50. 

i'm curious to as how you guys would approach this data cleaning. While I've dealt with data cleansing in the form of formatting/deduping and such, I've never really encountered data that was this inaccurate. Does the whole idea of crap in crap out apply to this project?

2822,datascience,How to set data scope for analysis of customer behaviour in online retail,"Hi, I am working in a large corporation and have been tasked together with a colleague to analyse customer behaviour by looking at online retail. We have good experience in SQL and R but neither of us has done such a data exploration project yet. We have a data base with transaction data that we can connect to customer meta data such as age, gender, country and more. The plan is to use R and extract data from the data base into .tsv files into a R data frame. From there we would generate graphs using ggplot, dpylr and lubridate. So a pretty standard setup and we could just follow standard guides such as [https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/09/customer-segmentation-r-users.html](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2019/09/customer-segmentation-r-users.html) or [https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/430563\_d38c12b53d724fa6852949b1f3e4ffbf.html](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/430563_d38c12b53d724fa6852949b1f3e4ffbf.html).

However, we struggle already at the beginning because the data volume is very large (multiple million rows per month) and we can only extract 100k rows at once due to data warehouse restriction rules.

The options I see currently to get around the data volume problem is to either extract dozens of files and glue them together in R (not cool) or pull a randomized small sample instead of the full data where we would have to ensure that it's representative.

Do you guys have any experience or recommendations how to approach this for beginners?

How can we keep the data volume manageable and what is a good timeframe to get insights from short-term customer behaviour? A year, 6 months? Randomized sample?

How many orders or customers do we need to look at to get a good picture? 1% of orders? 5% of customers?"

I was looking around briefly to see if there was anything in sklearn that did a bit of automatic deduction in this regard but I didn't seem to find anything.

What I'm thinking about writing operates on the dtypes of a dataframe and will do things like separate strings as categorical variables, separate low-unique-count numeric columns as categorical (not ordinal), and then apply standard scaling to the remaining numeric columns. This would be configurable at runtime, but would establish a base upon which pipelines could begin tweaking data preprocessing. Part of this configuration is that you could skip scaling altogether if you so desired to test on raw values from a dataset.

I heard that things like Tensor flow work on old version of python and in the anaconda download it says that V3.7 is being downloaded. So how is that managed?

And how does jupyter notebook work,like does it depend on the libraries you have in your computer (do i need pandas installed to use it in the notebook)?"
2870,datascience,New physics grad -- what can I do to use AI to help the world?,"
I should (hopefully) be confirmed my physics degree once results for the final semester come in a few weeks time. Here's what I know I *don't* want:



1. Down the line with a few years of experience under my belt and hard work, a salary any less than ($80,000 - $100,000 a year)
2. Repetitive, unstimulating desk job -- even if it makes a lot of money
3. Being a developer rather than designer. I'd love to help use VR to improve an area of someone's life somehow for example, but I wouldn't want to be tasked with creating graphics. I'd want to design the VR world itself in terms of concepts and design.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a preference to fun over pay. Here's what is quite important to me:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Constantly varying work, shifting from project to project
2. Work that directly helps other people
3. Easily able to get into a flow state. Challenging, collaborative work
4. Nice social atmosphere
5. A way to scratch my creative itch (even if it's just allowing me to complete a task in my own unique way)
6. Being able to wake up in the morning with a ""Why?"" in how my work helps people directly
7. Being able to see the fruits of my labor other than just pay -- progress in the projects I take part in
8. Not just working on a computer. Getting up, walking around, talking and planning and discussing with other people. Variety in the day-to-day.
9. Nice benefits and vacation. Work events and fun. Fair hours. Perhaps some at-home work options (not a huge deal)

&amp;#x200B;

To be honest, these might just be everyone else's. Some random things I think would be extremely meaningful to me if I could ever dream of taking part in this in life:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Helping to program the AI in the brain of  the first artifically intelligent robot
2. Using machine learning/AI to help cure a major disease/illness or discover a possible treatment
3. Use robotics to help build exoskeletal machines for the disabled
4. Develop VR into its rightful future state -- at the top of gaming and applicable to things in real life which can help people (perhaps dealing with mental issues)

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I like gaming, machine learning and artifical intelligence, and I want to use it somehow in healthcare or in developing new novel things. Does anyone have any careers I might be able to pursue that can provide the things that I've listed that are important to me? How would I go about and starting a career in that area as a fresh grad?"

2876,datascience,Would it be foolish for me to turn down a (non-data) Tesla internship?,"My undergrad and professional background is in industrial engineering/supply chain but I started grad school for data science last fall. I have always loved stats and programming which is what drew me to IE but felt like I wasn‚Äôt able to get roles that were analytical *enough* for my liking. 

This week I was able to secure two offers for summer internships (after weeks of anxious scrambling but that‚Äôs another story). One of them is Tesla. While obviously not a part of FAANG, I definitely perceive Tesla as at or just below that level. The only ‚Äúissue‚Äù is that it‚Äôs not really an analytical role, it‚Äôs very supply chain oriented (like my background) with just one project with one of their analytics teams (which was a post-offer request from me). So like best-case scenario, the role is like 20-25% analytics, and the rest is similar to experience I already have. 

All I‚Äôll say about the other offer is it‚Äôs a place that‚Äôs reputable but nowhere near the level of Tesla, and that the role‚Äôs primary function is about data management and analysis, more what I was hoping for. 

As someone who‚Äôs trying to break into the tech industry, is it foolish of me to turn down a summer at Tesla, even if the role is not very techy? It *feels* like it would open doors for me just on name alone. Or am I overevaluating the worth of such a role, and would make more sense to take the other role that‚Äôs more in the tech wheelhouse skillset-wise?"
2877,datascience,Flatiron School shady?,"I recently enrolled in Flatiron School's Data Science program. My skepticism slowly but surely rose each week, but it has been at an all time high this week because of what just happened:

My program has moved online due to the virus, which sort of works out for me since I the program is in NYC and I am for based there. I submitted an Income Share Agreement form and everything went through, but just today my **ISA got cancelled by Flatiron**. When I emailed them to ask why, my admissions rep called me to tell me that **ISA's were actually illegal in my state (California)**, and my two options were:

1. Move to NYC 
   1. (which I don't want to do until I have an NYC job secured
   2. also because coronavirus
   3. also because the program is online anyway, whats the point in being in an expensive NYC apt doing the same thing I can be doing from my home in California?)
2. Use the loan programs, which he told me can be less expensive than the ISA
   1.  I don't believe this. ISA has a payment ceiling of 1.5x the original amount (17K) where as the loan is going to have interest that will probably add up fast

I'm really considering breaking off the relationship altogether, has anyone else had shady experiences like this?

2884,datascience,Should I stay or should I go?,"TL;DR: Uncertainty clouds my Data Science aspirations at my current employer (550 employees) due to my boss seeming slightly self-serving. Assuming my life situation is stable, should I stay or should I go? I love you all! BLM.

Hello everyone! A bit about me for context. I am happy to provide more details. Please feel free to point me in the direction of good resources. I am not afraid to do some work for answers.

* 5 years in IT (infrastructure mostly)
* Systems Engineer 
* Community Bank (3 billion in assets). Data Science is a legitimate business need and I can make the case, but haven't.
* I support, implement, and manage all banking related business applications
* Family of almost 4 (2 year old and newborn with an ETA of this month)
* Low cost of living state (near Nashville, TN) 
* I spend about 2-4 hours a week on the side studying Data Science related tools and feel I need more math skills

I have a BS in Comp Sci from a state school, but fell into an infrastructure role (sys admin for the last 2.5 yrs). My title, like many folks, does not reflect my day to day work, which I am not sour about at all. I really get a high from discovering patterns and it brings me so much joy in my work when I get the chance. I have been doing pretty much the same thing since I started, and I am REALLY bored. I handle all complex issues, implementations, and data requests (what do we have, where is it, how do I get it). The business as a whole does not follow what seems to be the standard path to properly using data. Employees pick and choose from sub-systems and lose sight of the entire customer's story.  


My issue is this; I know that I would really love to transition into data science. I have expressed to my boss that I am bored, they have consistently promoted me and given me just enough money to keep me happy. 

My question boils down to two thing:

1. Should I articulate to my boss (Director of IT) that I want to move to Data Science, and how do you suggest I approach it? (he is a high D/I on the disk personality profile for reference). He doesn't seem to want to scale leadership to other team members.
2. Since I get a slight feeling that boss seems self-serving, do I just leave (I live near Nashville, TN. A hella hot job market even with the pandemic)?"

So consider me a complete novice. 

I want to move into a brand management role in the future, for which I'm pursuing an MBA, and I want to pad up my resume a little bit, so that I could also consider market analytics/business analytics roles, just to keep my options open. 

Now, I keep reading about how 'easy' languages like Python and R are, for beginners to learn. 
Which I'm sure is hyperbole - if it was so easy, and data science is so in-demand also, I'm sure there'd be more people doing it. 

So what I want to understand is: 

1. how easy/difficult it is to learn coding well enough to actually land a business analytics/market analytics role at a reputed company? - like, are we talking 'one free course on Udemy', or 'MBA In business analytics from Sloan' 
 
how much time/investment/effort would it take basically - is it something which can be learned by doing 1-2 hours on the side a day for a few months?

I recently graduated with a degree in Econ. I was always planning on doing grad school but recently was more interested in data analyst type roles. I currently have a job lined up for the next 1-2 years. However, this semester was particularly difficult because of coronavirus and I ended failing a math course. Obviously this is not an automatic disqualifier, but I was wondering for entry level data analyst types of positions if you usually are required to submit a transcript with your applications or just record your GPA? I guess I have an okay explanation for failing this course and will try to take it again this summer. Regardless, I would enjoy hearing your experiences about if your transcript was required as part of a pre screening process or if was only required towards the end as a verification sort of thing. Thanks!"

I can get into DS, but I am really not sure about it as I often read that PHD is needed to land a job. Will my accounting experience be any asset to it? Both coding and DS seems interesting to me.

95% of my data science org continues to use pyspark, while 100% of the data engineers we work with use scala.

I'd like to mount a campaign to slowly convert my colleagues to Scala. I'm thinking of writing internal libraries to help automate certain workloads (i.e. loading datasets, transforming them, A/B testing frameworks, etc.), bringing in outside trainers, and having office hours to help transition more folks to scala.

Any other tips to help transition the org to Scala? I don't want to be one of two data scientists writing Scala because inevitably some manager will tell me to conform and write pyspark instead. Or I'll have colleagues that will ask me to convert my scala code to pyspark (even though they are brain-dead simple to convert)"

2959,datascience,Looking for a career change!,"Hi everyone! This is gonna be long so please bear with me. Let me just give your a little bit of background so that you guys could offer me a specific advice. Thank you in advance! 

Background: I did my undergrad in Mechanical Engineering and graduated last year itself, but I realized in my second year that I‚Äôm not really into that. Hence, I did business related internships in Business Development. Where I come from, it‚Äôs not easy to switch majors and you are not given much options in the first place. After graduation, I started working in B2B sales which I really liked but at the end of the day I wasn‚Äôt learning or improving myself. The role was good enough for improving soft-skills but not the technical skills. I left in December, and decided to go for Masters in Management with a concentration in International Business. Later, I got an admit from one of the finest schools in Canada and the program is starting in Jan next year. They also had a business analytics program, but I didn‚Äôt apply considering that I didn‚Äôt have the analytical skills. But, I learned those within a span of 6 months, from Jan this year to June. I learned SQL, Tableau, Python, and advanced Excel. Also, I applied for a job and got in as a profile of operations analyst, but the work seems very different from what I imagined as a data analyst or a person in data science does. 

The silver lining is that the company which I just joined in June has a data analytics department where a person could move after 6 months of so if he/she performs well. At this point of time, I‚Äôm really confused. I really want to get into Data Science and this seems like a right way. But, in case I‚Äôm not able to change departments, I will be stuck here and miss out my chance of going to Canada. Also, I think, I made a mistake of not applying to data related master programs. So, should I apply to data science/ BA related courses now? 

Any feedback will be helpful as I have got 6 months to figure this out. My ultimate goal is to be in a field where I could improve my hard skills."

2961,datascience,Off My Chest. After almost 9+ face-to-face interviews I cannot even get a simple entry level Data Analyst job for almost 7 months now. Any advice?,"I did my BSc in 2017, worked as a SQL analyst for 5 months and I completed my Data Science MSc end of last year. For a entry level analyst role I have the skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python, I even did a tableau course on Analysis/ Data Science.  One of my concern is my in depth knowledge on the tools and programs above as I have no idea how to compare myself to another analyst.  

I have a speech impediment which as expected gets worse during interviews as I have to think on my feet really quickly. I feel like I struggle with the competency-based questions, because due to my stammer I cannot use the STAR method correctly. Most of my feedback from the interviews were I wasn't the right candidate and other had fit the bill etc etc. ""you weren't confident, and they felt I wasn't strong enough"". I have never doubted myself nor have I lost confidence. 

Especially during the lock-down, it‚Äôs hard for me to get an interview as most companies are closed and those that are still hiring start from a telephone call. In terms of landing an interview I have refined my CV with professional help and most interview reaches the face-to-face stage. 

I am really afraid that I will slowly lose all my knowledge and programming and analytical skills which will cause me to lose an interview in the future. My goal is to be a Data Science in the future but I cannot even land a entry level Data Analyst position. 

Would appreciate if you guys can answer these questions. 

* What does an entry Data Analyst do on day to day basis? 
* What skills do I need to polish?      
* Are there any alternative ways to answer the competency-based questions?

Because of COVID-19, we are creating contingency plans for the fall in the event that we have to begin the semester online. Currently, the plan is to adopt a 1-1-2 schedule for the fall semester. Students would take one 3.5 week course, followed by another 3.5 week course, followed by two 7 week courses (taken simultaneously). The idea being that we could open for in-person classes in between any of these mini-terms, thereby limiting the number of online courses we have to deliver. Or, if things don't improve, we could deliver everything online, but faculty/students wouldn't have to juggle as many courses at the same time. 

The problem is that course registration has already happened and course registration was based on a normal 16 week course schedule, not the 1-1-2 schedule discussed above. So we are trying to figure out to rearrange the course schedule so that the everyone* is able to take the courses the signed up for.

Any ideas on where to look/start? I'm definitely not expecting definitive answers, but any advice or ideas would be helpful.

This is a bit of a long vent but I had to put it here: 
So I graduated with an MS in CS last year after a long strenuous time. I had multiple hurdles (moved to a new country, met with a serious accident, spent a lot of time in court to get my bills covered etc.). 

I was already tired and the job search began. It lasted 7 months with 3 rescinded offers (budget issues) and finally an offer as a digital marketing analyst. The job was very basic and paid minimal, but I was grateful nevertheless. But I was slowly getting tired of the whole DS hype. I got laid off six months into the job, just when I was starting to build profiling tools and interesting things. 

It‚Äôs been a month since the layoff, and I‚Äôve had a couple of calls from large companies, but still waiting for final offers. I‚Äôm super frustrated, stuck without family and slowly losing interest in DS itself. I feel like my degree was just a huge loan that I need to repay, but I don‚Äôt want that to be the case. 

I would love to hear any ideas or suggestions to keep this going. I‚Äôm already pretty experienced in SQL, Python, C/C++ etc. I feel that I could do some big data work, but I don‚Äôt know where to start."

2984,datascience,Data Science Career Path (using R) - What are the options?,"Hello!
I am currently still an undergrad at University, my usual degree is in Anthropology (Social and Biological), but I have been doing a year in data analytics, so essentially a full year just learning R. I have really enjoyed it, and I am (after many hurdles and confidence blocks) have started getting relatively good at it (I would say, for only having done it for a few months now). 

The thing I enjoy by bar is the data visualisation aspect of using R, creating graphs that look good and communicate the data well. I do art on the side, so I think this is why I like it because I get to be creative, try out new things, and I think I have a good eye for it. Is it possible to have jobs specifically for this? I have tried to do a bit of research etc into it and closest I have found is a data analyst but nothing specifically for visual display, I'm assuming because it includes all areas this is why.

It's not a definite career path, and something I would have never considered before this year, but I have found myself really enjoying it. I want to keep it up after my course has finished and I will be using it in my University work, and maybe even try and apply for a masters at some point.

My question is though, for these kind of jobs, more so entry level/junior jobs, what kind of standard/amount of knowledge is expected? 
At the moment I am able to: do a fair amount of data wrangling, linear and logistic regressions, good use of ggplot, scrape data from wikepedia, t-tests and other kinds of basic stats tests, clustering, PCA plots, classification-decision tree making and editing and random forests. I am looking into doing some morphometric work as well. Some of these things i'm stronger at than others. 

Is there anything you would recommend learning in spare time that will be useful to practice? Any sort of practical tips would be very useful and helpful! I enjoy just doing this stuff on datasets I've found online and want to learn as much as I can in my spare time

I see the utility in information entropy, but I think some theoretical results would be a lot more digestible if they were formulated in terms of expectation of a bit to transmit through a signal correctly with probability p rather than the ""flipped"" concept you find information entropy. With information entropy you end up having to take a bunch of negative logarithms which is very reminiscent of something you'd do in chemistry (pKa vs pH).

At this point, does more unemployment predict better stock market? It seems like perhaps doing the complete opposite of intuition will lead to the best portfolio. While there are many factors when considering stock prices, there is no doubt that COVID-19 has been, by far, the largest factor in recent stock market prices. And with stocks rising, it seems that the translation between reality and stock prices has never been more off. 

So what‚Äôs going on? I've had this question on my mind and I propose the key concept lies in that stock prices are base don future outlooks. The underlying cause for this mistranslation is that uncertainty and pessimism drop stock prices whereas positive outlook leads to higher current day prices. That being said, how exactly do we measure something as fantastical as ‚Äúpositive‚Äù outlook? In this article, I propose models and visualize behaviors and viewpoints on the current market.

This is my first non-tutorial type of blog and am open to any feedback / critiques / comments :). Thank you!"

3006,datascience,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation."

I understand the graph itself was done in R with ggplot2. The highlighted color areas must've been done in something else after like Photoshop or Illustrator.

My question is similar to one asked here 5 years ago where one of the programmers from the chart mentioned something called ChartBuilder.

3039,datascience,BI Engineer to Data Analytics," 

Hello, I am a junior BI Engineer with 1 year of experience. I have been trying to switch career data analytics, but most jobs require 3-5 years of experience... and it's not like CS jobs where I can make a great project to impress the recruiters. I have been studying Tableau and got certified, working on a significant case study, and learning JavaScript for basic web development. I also have several AWS certifications.

Honestly, I am not sure if there is anything I can do this time. I am not expecting the economy will recover until the summer of 2021, and the job market in Canada is way worse compared to US/UK. Luckily my parents can still support me, but I want to make the best out of it and come out strong.

Doing more projects won't help sadly, since most data science jobs require MS. To be competitive for data analytics, I even thought about passing CFA level 1 because I have seen quite a few risk data analyst jobs that use a lot of Python, SQL, Tableau, R. But it is a huge commitment and costly.

How do junior BI Engineers get a job in data analytics?"

I recently came across someone on LinkedIn through someone I follow and they claim they are the ""Forbes AI Innovator of the Year"" (if you know, you know). The only reference I find to this is an interview on a YouTube channel of a weird website that is handing out awards like ""AI Innovator of the Year"".

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords. 

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?"

I see a lot of linear regression being somewhat of a standard in a lot of data analyst/scientist requirements, but wanted to see if there was some order to learning some other statistical analyses that would make my progression in the statistical side of things more fluid and easiler to grasp and retain, rather than jump to higher level stuff that might be way over my head for now.
