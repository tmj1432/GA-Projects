0,Anxiety,does anyone else’s anxiety not really give physical symptoms?,For me it’s like all mental only.
1,Anxiety,deleting instagram account,"Hi I’m thinking about deleting my instagram account because it’s getting to addictive and fueling my anxiety. Instagram is usually what I go on when I feel anxious and it usually makes things worse, I feel like Im pretty much addicted to it. To give some background I deal with excessive worry, anxiety and OCD. However, my group of friends uses instagram pretty much all day. Im kind of worried what they would think and how they might perceive me. I would delete my account so I don’t keep going back to it because I keep re-downloading the app and logging back in. Any thoughts on what I should do?"
2,Anxiety,my mother is so selfish,so my moms best friends son needed a specialist that could prescribe him anxiety meds and do check ups and all that. well my brother used to go to a doctor like that so my mom told her to take him to the same guy. she was telling me the whole story and how she was so happy she could help them find a doctor. yet i’m over here struggling more than I ever have. I’ve given up on even trying to tell her how I feel but she knows how bad my anxiety is. she won’t let me take meds because of ONE bad experience on a. she’s always preaching how she wishes she could help me yet does nothing to actually help me. she won’t help me find a good therapist she won’t let me go to the doctor or go on meds. yet she’ll help someone else’s kid. my anxiety is so bad my life is being ruined and she couldn’t care less. It’s so exhausting telling someone how you feel and they just dont care. she always either changes the subject when I explain my anxiety or she tells me to just not think like that. I get it she’s going through things too but as my mother who claims she cares so much you”d think she’d try and help me a little more. I even feel selfish for saying that. I know i’m not the only thing that matters but while everyone else is getting help i’m still in the same boat and honestly it’s drowning.
3,Anxiety,Tips for anxiety driving in a car with others,"For context, I had my first panic attack in 2020 and they kept occurring in public areas. I was diagnosed with a panic disorder and agoraphobia and went on medication. I began exposure therapy and my anxiety went away almost completely. I could enter stores and not feel the urge to vomit. Then, I stopped taking my meds at the beginning of 2022. It wasn’t on purpose at first but then I realized I was completely fine without them so I stopped. Then in April on 2022, I had another panic attack driving to the airport with friends for spring break. Ever since then, I have driven with people and have felt super anxious. (My medication prevents panic attacks but it doesn’t help with the anxiety, I am going to talk to my doctor about getting on another set of medication that will help with anxiety in general). Now I typically drive alone or I’ll be the one to drive because I am in control. Even when I drive with other people I still get anxious but not as much as when I’m not the one driving. I need help. This is ruining my life all over again and exposure therapy has not been helping this time. I had my boyfriend drive me an hour, which I thought would help me realize I’ll be okay, but it didn’t. It’s the same thing over and over again and I don’t know what to do. So if anyone has any tips or anything, please let me know. I feel so alone in this and everyone judges and hates that I will always take a separate car wherever I am going. It’s led me to not do certain things such as going up north with my boyfriend because I can’t be in the car with him for 4 hours. I’ll feel trapped.
Sorry for the rant I just need help. Also, I don’t do therapy but I may start if that could help."
4,Anxiety,"Please support me during the loss of my emotional support cat, Mister Pants",I know we did the right thing today. I know it was his time.  I am so scared to be without him. My heart is shattered…  he was there for every panic attack to[ hold my hand](https://imgur.com/a/GYRj6se)
5,Anxiety,What is wrong with me?,"Why am I so afraid of driving?? I’ve had moments where I get in the car, I’m ready to conquer the journey, but then my brain goes into autopilot, I’m terrified, I can’t react, I feel so beyond stupid. I’m not the brightest person in the world, but I know of people much dumber than me who drive just fine. I don’t get why I can’t do this. I’ve taken advice from people (start small, go on just one short errand, go in places that are empty, etc) but it doesn’t work, I get terrified and fuck up everytime. I started driving last year and got my license in June, my skills have plateaued but my confidence has gone wayyyy down. Don’t know what to do anymore."
6,Anxiety,Ive asked before but i just want to double check because im paranoid,"I was prescribed hydroxyzine at urgent care. I ended up going because my anxiety was giving me horrible palpitations. Ive never taken any kind of anxiety medication, can you tell me your experiences with it?"
7,Anxiety,Can anger and frustrating create anxiety?,"Over this past year I've been getting really upset with politics and stuff. I'm also thinking lots about my past and how unfulfilled I felt.  Just brooding every single day over things since I live at my parents and never leave the property. Often I switch between selfless thoughts of the whole worlds suffering and injustice, to then be angry about petty things like letting somebody talk down to me years ago.

Can this create anxiety even when I'm not thinking about it anymore?"
8,Anxiety,Cannot sleep because of adrenaline rushes,Every time I’m about to drift off tonight I’ve had an adrenaline rush that wakes me right back up. It’s probably happened at 5-10 times tonight and I’m getting really frustrated. I have work in the morning
9,Anxiety,Feel like I'm losing it,"I feel like I'm more sensitive than I should be. I just keep having thoughts of why my son's dad doesn't love me but he's a jerk and off his rocker honestly.  I'm overwhelmed with child care ND parenting of 2 toddlers alone. No one asks if I'm okay. They just expect me to smile and laugh and just be ok. 

I have no one I can be vulnerable with. I have so much on my mind . Concerning what's fair and isnt fair concerning my daughter's dad. Idk I feel I have alot on my mind. Everyday is a heavy struggle. 

I feel it's alot I want to give up."
10,Anxiety,Skin sensitivity and wanting to crawl right on out,I get so sensitive to others touching my skin that it makes me squirm and I want to crawl directly out of my skin. My boyfriend can’t even rub my arm. It’s similar to the feeling of hearing nails on a chalk board. It just makes me want to crawl out and somehow triggers anxiety. It gives the feeling of restless leg syndrome but over my whole body. Maybe it’s part of being overstimulated? I’ve never heard of this before
11,Anxiety,please help panicking right now,"so all of a sudden on my left side like right under my lowest ribs there’s this odd buzzing sensation or almost twitching/pulsing and a little pressure?? nothing hurts when i press on the area and my breathing is fine, i had yoga a few hours ago and have been gassy today but i don’t know what that sensation and pressure is please help i’m freaking out"
12,Anxiety,Worst night ever,"I just had the worst night ever, since I got diagnosed two years ago. Insomnia, panic attacks, vomiting, endless crying. My stomach hurts so badly and I cannot stop shivering. (I also have my period..) 

The main reason is, that I have an unresolved issue with my insurance regarding payment - it is most likely a misunderstanding. BUT they immediately send a bailiff without warning, that will visit me sometime today. 
The rational part of my mind says, that I can just explain myself, but my anxiety is ruling me. I went through literally every horror scenario on earth and am terrified they will take everything from me. The thought of a stranger entering my apartment scares me to death.
I feel horrible and like a criminal.

Somehow, it got worse. 

My toenail just completely broke off - all of it. It is a bloody mess and I cannot fix it myself. So I have to visit a doctor today, as soon as I can. Something I put off for too long out of fear. 

I haven't eaten since yesterday, because I cannot hold it in and I am terrified. Nothing I learned in therapy is working right now :(

Do you guys have some insane tips on how to overcome horror nights like mine? How do you recover from all the negative thoughts and emotions? 

My plan right now is:
- Eat some liquid food &amp; drink water
- shower
- go to the doctor right away

Anything else I can do to survive?"
13,Anxiety,Is anybody else having anxiety about the possibility of a nuclear war?,[removed]
14,Anxiety,can someone just tell me i'll be okay,"i've been struggling with work anxiety recently and i've called off my last few shifts. I had a huge nervous breakdown and my mum had to call my manager because she was convinced she had to send me into a psych ward, but she wasn't sure yet. My manager said it was fine and just asked that I let her know what's going on so she knows if she needs to cancel my shifts. After a chat with my doctor, I decided I would be fine without a hospital and I just needed some rest. I called today and said I would be able to go in tomorrow because my anxiety isn't too bad right now, and I really do need the money. Now that I've said yes to the shift though, my anxiety is up again. I know I'll be okay because it's only a 3 and a half hour shift, but I'm still really nervous. Can someone let me know I'll be okay and that I am able to do this?"
15,Anxiety,Everyone always says I stress and worry too much. Do you understand this is anxiety? I CANT HELP IT.,"They do not try and make me feel bad but when someone says ""hunny you stress to much. Your overthinking it. You worry to much what people think. You say sorry to much."" 
I KNOW THIS AND I CANNOT HELP IT BUT YOU POINTING IT OUT FUELS MY LOW SELF ESTEEM AND ANXIETY. 

Like how the f*ck can EVERYONE see my anxiety. I am so hopeless it feels like. 

Thanks for reading."
16,Anxiety,Firsts,"On a date with myself today. Not going to let anxiety get the better of me. 

I am going to have some delicious fish and then have a coffee at my favourite cafe and read a book.

I am going to forget about reality for this afternoon.

Wish me luck!"
17,Anxiety,not missing my friends anymore,"i’m away at college and i’ve realized that i don’t miss most of my friends back at home. i talk regularly to two of them, but the rest of my friends annoys me now. i don’t want to be that friend that changes and falls out with the rest of the group but i genuinely am having so much anxiety having to go back home because i don’t want to be with them. i know i’m going to feel lonely back at home because i won’t have many people if i stop hanging out with them, but i just can’t do it. there’s nothing wrong with them i just feel like i had a realization while away. i feel super guilty"
18,Anxiety,instigate fear?,Do any of you also instigate your fear? I tell myself I'm going to get sick all the time.. and idk how to stop.
19,Anxiety,just realized i am deathly afraid of total darkness,"i was playing on my oculus and then the power went out for longer than it had before (its storming, lights flickered on and off). the tracking stopped on the oculus, putting on a loading screen and so i took it off and was gonna leave it off cus it was already low on battery. but then i saw how dark it was. the lights on it shut off and there i was.

i saw nothing

i had never just.. seen NOTHING before. i had always thought a fear of the dark was absurd, its just the absence of light after all. but i was terrified. 

i curled up on the couch pondering my newfound fear. i decided to cover my eyes and pretend that it was ME inflicting the darkness. something i could control. i calmed down a lil and looked (felt) for my phone. 

i figured out i can pick up the vr and use the light from the lens to see a little. i found my phone and here i am now. my heart is racing. flashlight on.

i hear the sliding door... move. sometimes. like an old door would creak. it's unnatural. im tryna convince myself its in my head, but i know it isnt. i wanna wake up my dad and hug him, but i just cant. i might go sleep in his room soon though.

darkness is scary

my stomach is in pain

im gonna socialize on videogames while i wait for tiredness to come."
20,Anxiety,I need help I’m really scared,"I’m sorry if this is triggering. I’m on vacation and I caught a cold(potentially Covid). I’m dizzy all day and feel like shit. 

Yesterday I was laying down kind of napping and I had this weird thought about numbers and a task that would take forever/be impossible. It was extremely abstract and even thinking now I cannot describe it. I went into a panic attack I have never experienced before.

I’ve had panic attacks that always are physical. I take deep breaths and I’m ok. This was different. I have having extreme delusional thoughts. Felt like I was on a hallucinogenic drug or something weird. I’ve never had this happen to me. I’m extremely shaken up and feel like I have Ptsd. I’m scared. Any advise or anything you have experienced."
21,Anxiety,Best anxiety med if I suffer from insomnia?,I’ve suffered from insomnia for years. It’s time to look into treatment for my anxiety. Do you have any recommendations for an Rx that will not make my anxiety worse?
22,Anxiety,Feel stuck,"I feel dumb writing this and letting my feelings out on the internet but I’m feeling really stuck. Idk if you guys have any advice. I started community college in august and I haven’t made one friend. I tried joining a club but I’m not even joking whe I say NO ONE showed up😭and the campus I go too isn’t the main campus so there aren’t many clubs/activities. I literally haven’t had any friends in a year and a half. I feel so alone and im so tired of living this way. I smoke a lot of weed more than I would like to admit and sometimes I feel like im nothing but a pothead. I don’t like school much except for one class and have no idea what I want to do in life. I really don’t want to work 9-5 my whole life and honestly hate that you have to go to school to be successful. I have never liked school, I enjoy learning but I hate school. I just wish I was good at something and had a cool hobby. I feel so stuck and all I do is go to school come home go to work repeat. I don’t drive or have any friends so I’m alawyas alone. I hate this so much it’s so depressing and the only thing that helps is weed. I thought school would be my salvation or whatveer but I don’t like it like I’m getting my degree because it’s important but I’m really not happy. I stay positive tho and try my best I’m just really tired of loving this way it has been a year and a half. My teen years have sucked so far and are sucking even worse rn. If I didn’t have weed I probably wouldn’t be here right now. Everything went to crap once I lost my only friend and did my senior year of high school online. I’m honestly miserable but I’m positive around everyone else and do everything I can to try to be happy. I’m just lonely bored sad lost confused and anxious that it won’t get better anytime soon it has literally been a year and a half. Idk if anyone will read this but my bad if it doesn’t make sense idc about punctuation rn I’m down in the dumps but at least I had a decent weekend. I just don’t make what to do anymore. I live in Miami and this is the worst place to make friends. I don’t even have anyone to go to the beach with like omg"
23,Anxiety,I went for a walk by myself,There's a dairy near my house about 15 mins away so I went for a walk over there I only reached about halfway before I had a panic attack and came home but it's still progress.
24,Anxiety,I got my driver’s license!!,"At the ripe age of 25. I’ve had such crippling anxiety about driving for the past 10 years. I finally got fed up and just did the damn thing. Took a little while but I finally did it!! I still feel a little adrenaline whenever I’m about to drive somewhere, but maybe that will go away eventually. 


Either way, if you have driving anxiety, just know it is possible to conquer it even if it feels impossible in the moment."
25,Anxiety,any time i try to sleep my heart starts racing and I'm scared to die,im so tired but i don't want to die I'm scared that if i fall asleep I'll die
26,Anxiety,I feel like I’m lazy and worthless,"
So I’m a 21F in college. And I’m a communications major so my classes are easy and I don’t  have much homework. I’m not in any clubs because I get very anxious around people. And j don’t workout because of that same reason. I usually stay in my apartment most of the time. And I feel so lazy. I also can’t get a job because i don’t have a car and already applied to the ones on campus. I feel so worthless because I don’t have many friends here and I’ve tried to dm and talk to PLENTY of people here and they aren’t interested in making friends"
27,Anxiety,How to fix my anxiety,Sometimes I just want to disappear so badly everything stresses me out and idk where to start fixing it I just think all the time makes it hard to connect with people really and creates problems for friends most of the time I try to be quiet but it’s still a problem and when I talk it sounds so dumb I just want to feel normal idk maybe I’m normal what do it do
28,Anxiety,Crippling Anxiety,I feel like I’m crying out for help. My anxiety is spiraling out of control. I started a new job and it’s turned into a disaster. I’ve had trouble w/ my boss which I’ve had to escalate &amp; it’s like I can’t do anything right. It’s triggered my anxiety so bad that it’s hard to function. I can barely eat or sleep. It’s now every thought I have throughout the day. I want to quit without anything else lined up because my mental health has hit rock bottom. I’ve never been in a situation like this. I don’t know what to do and I just want to quit feeling like this…
29,Anxiety,Shamed for having anxiety,"I have bad anxiety, more in a hypochondriac way I’m always worried about getting sick or something.
It stems from having a lot of irrational fears projected onto me growing up from an over strict and paranoid parent.

I’m working on my anxiety so I don’t become like this for my child.

I’m also aware of my anxiety’s we’re my parent denys having any. 

Anyway-

Since becoming pregnant it’s been worse as I worry about my baby.
A lot of it is revolves around food poisoning but sometimes it’s extra like getting worried a cut will become infected, worried I inhaled to much chemicals while cleaning ect ect… 

Occasionally I’ll post to a sub-reddit group for opinions of people who are professionals in certain subjects and they’ll be able to answer my questions just to ease my anxiety and some people are genuinely helpful but their is always someone who comments nothing helpful and always says something like “is this a real question” and it always ends up making me feel so much worse.

People will comment things like this and then they begin to have conversations about me under my post- things I read are like-
“Wow I think she is serious have you seen her post history”

…it’s so hurtful 
I know I have anxiety but these comments are so low and make me feel really weird.

I would never make someone feel insecure about them selves especially when it comes to pointing out mental illness issues.

:(

I know reddit comes with peoples opinions and I need to be resilient and open to receiving comments I don’t necessarily want to see but I just came here to vent and to see if anyone ever feels like they’re in the same boat?"
30,Anxiety,Please someone stay with me,"I been away from US for almost a month now and my anxiety became worse after something happened in my family. (An issue with my sister.) I been trying to control but every time around the same hour I feel anxious and scared. I can’t sleep please I need reassurance I’m crying while typing this 😢😢😢

32,Anxiety,new cat anxiety,"Hi there, so I adopted a cat two days ago. He is called Scooter, he is 3 months old and he is my first pet. I've always wanted a cat and I'm so happy he's here. But since I got him my anxiety is through the roof. Last time I even got a panic attack. I'm worried every time I have to leave the house something happens to him. Every time he makes a noise like meowing or chirping I'm worried something is wrong. He's eating and going to the litterbox so he seems fine but I'm just stressed AF. 

Have any of you experienced the same and has any tips for me? It would mean a lot."
33,Anxiety,a story we all read before.,I got fucked at Amazon. Qlirch in the system. Totslled my car not my fault. Still 209 ticket. We just bough a house. Dk if I'm fired. I have side gigs. Not sure if money is  when I'm looking for. I'm negative in everything. I'm not special ima my way. I'm that regard. I went to the casino with my nephew he lost 300 of his money.

34,Anxiety,Anxiety over my internet friend's disappearance (Possible suicide)," So I myself suffer from a myriad of mental health problems, but I came across and got to know a guy on discord and we've been talking. Today he was acting strange and after saying ""he would do it"" he's stopped replying... Idk what to feel... I feel as if it's my fault...

He randomly messaged me claiming he found me on a common game server as we started chatting. Now I myself suffer from suicidal thoughts and have tried to take my own life before. So I didn't want it to be a burden. But he kept saying stuff like I love you that made me super uncomfortable and I eventually told him I didn't like it. Then he said he would say it one last time then ""do it"" and then never came back online. Now I'm wracked with guilt. I closed myself off from people to avoid this EXACT situation... Can anyone help me ? Thanks"
35,Anxiety,Extremely weird sensation in chest and arms when waking up,"My sleep troubles started at the beginning of last year with the onset of my anxiety. I've been having trouble staying asleep since then.

But since the past few months, I've observed something weird and it's difficult to explain. This happens every time I wake up be it in the middle of the night or in the morning.

I slowly seem to wake up from sleep starting with my brain... meaning I am conscious of the fact that I was asleep and am slowly waking up. But my body is not fully awake. I then feel my heart rate rising and strong heart beat and tingling sensation in my arms. It almost seems like all the blood was away from my extremities and is rushing away from my heart as I am waking up. It's a very uncomfortable feeling in my chest and also very scary because I feel something is wrong with my heart.

I have spent more than a couple thousand bucks on various tests like testing for nerve damage and sleep study but everything seems to be normal. Holter monitor for a couple of weeks was also fine. I'm so confused and scared and need to know what's going on with me."
36,Anxiety,My ex friend said me having anxiety is abusive towards my boyfriend,"Um hi i’m new to the sub and hoped someone could give me an unbiased opinion on this.

So my ex friend (A) and I had a falling out after they said they didn’t want to talk to me anymore because of something traumatic that happened to me recently. And their reason was that my trauma, traumatized them. But when I tried to tell them that that upset me they called me manipulative and toxic so I blocked then which was probably stupid of me.

We have a mutual friend (B), and yesterday they went to my boyfriend (who this friend is also friends with) to talk about it and check up on him. My boyfriend knew of the falling out and told me that A told B that I was abusive towards my boyfriend due to me having anxiety. 

Some examples are that I have a huge fear of him cheating on me so he lets me know with who he talks to if I ask (he’s allowed the same). I also have agoraphobia(fear of being in public spaces) so when I have to go somewhere he comes with me most of the time.

Even though he was the one to suggest these things, i am now really scared that i’m being controlling or even worse. Friend B agrees with A but my boyfriend says he doesn’t. 

I don’t want to make it about me but this has strongly affected me and i’ve started isolating myself from everyone and idk what to do."
37,Anxiety,Just wanted to share,"Hey everyone , so my anxiety has been up to
a all time high for a various reasons.. But i just wanted to share something that really helped me. So when i get very anxious i have a very tight feeling of pressure in my chest, and something i realized that helps me get rid of that is literally just sitting down in a nice hot shower, not a bath but with the shower running. Eases my anxiety a ten fold. Just wanted to share and hope this helps somebody. I’m looking to try more natural methods then pills and weed, i feel that those are only a temporary fix."
38,Anxiety,Anxious about polygraph at work,"  

I managed to get out of my old, toxic job and got an amazing job at a new company, starting last week. I am currently in my probationary period. 

Now the new work routinely asks for a polygraph test of all new employees.  I received the test this morning with a group of other staff. The stress felt overwhelming, so much so that at one point I felt that I would pass out. I am terrified that I failed my polygraph because of my anxiety and that it is just a matter of time before I get fired. The person who gave the test either doesn’t have the results yet or can’t discuss them with me so I have no idea how it went.

I have to get on with my work, but I feel like crying at my desk with how scared and anxious I am.

(Small note on polygraphs in my country: They are inadmissible in court or even to dismiss someone from a job, but employers may use them before employing someone or during their probation and may choose to not extend a person’s contract or make them a permanent employee.)"
39,Anxiety,DAE get waves of vertigo even when sitting or laying down?,"Vertigo has been one of my main symptoms of anxiety for ages. For me it was never like the room is spinning, but like I'm on a boat or on an elevator right as it comes to a stop (basically, like my head ducks down while the ground moves up).

Recently though, I'll get the occasional wave while sitting down or even laying down (the latter much more rarely, but it does happen). CT scan I got ~a month ago (after passing out - turns out chronically low BP means I'm prone to vasovagal syncope, yay) says everything is fine and I have an appointment with an ENT scheduled, but it's a month out, and I do have a referral for and MRI too, it's just not scheduled yet, so I do have all the ""go see a doctor"" tips covered 😉.

Anyways,  this post is just to see if anyone else has experienced this to help calm me down in the long wait for an appointment."
40,Anxiety,Is there someone that I can talk to right now?,Just really need to talk to someone
41,Anxiety,Chest pain from anxiety?,"Two days ago I was feeling ok in the morning but around lunchtime the area around my heart started to hurt. Of course, pain around your heart is gonna give you anxiety, so it started to hurt more!
I got so scared I was so close to calling EMS to go to the hospital. 

But since I started having anxiety a lot more lately, I looked it up and wanted to see if it was connected to anything, to my surprise and relief, it is!?
Anxiety gives you chest pains?!? Is there nothing that anxiety DOESN’T make hurt?!? Why does it have to make the area around your heart hurt that gives you MORE ANXIETY!?!?! 

I have some muscle soothing patches that make the area it’s on cool and hurt less, but it feels like it doesn’t do much, or nothing at all. 

Does anyone have any advice to ease my anxiety and pain? If it doesn’t change tomorrow I’m gonna see a doctor about it. Even though one of my fears is getting put on a bunch of medications."
42,Anxiety,Anxiety relapse,"Been struggling with my anxiety now for new 4 years on and off but this weekend my body just decided to give me hell with it. Can’t stop being sick, the intrusive thoughts won’t go away and now I’m beginning to question everything in my life, from work to my relationship. Just wish there was a way to turn this all off, if only for a little bit"
43,Anxiety,Whats the Good way to tell my Overprotective parents about me using Discord behind there backs because of Anxiety?,"Basically I use Discord for things like being in servers related to games I play and art and my Parents don’t like me using anything to talk to strangers due to the dangers obviously even though I know what to look out for and wouldn’t get myself into any danger on purpose and that being on Discord helps me Distract myself from Bad Anxiety.

But Ive never told them I use Discord as Ive made great friends either 2-3years older or younger then me who cause nothing bad to happen to happen and aren’t anyone suspicious or creepy and that I wouldn’t want to loose those friends as in real life Ive struggled a-lot to make friends or to be social in the past and that Ive been able to learn about the games I like to play through others people who play the same games.

Ive been told to stop before when being caught a couple times and I tried but I couldn’t because of the friendships I had made and now that I’m 18 I feel like Im a responsible young adult and that my parents should trust me when using Discord.

Im just scared that if I told them I could loose everything on Discord even though its a positive thing that I use Discord for things I like and it could help me improve on skills for me like art for example.

Even considering just opening up to my parents about all this just so I wouldn’t have to hide anything as the whole reason I joined Discord was due to bad Social anxiety over the years and it helped me get through l a-lot of things.

I tend to get very bad anxiety about this to the point I feel sick when talking to my parents about these types of things as I have no idea on how they would respond or react causing me feel more nervous.

And I basically have no idea how to cope with the Anxiety when telling my parents about this as I know it will be alot to handle emotionally."
44,Anxiety,Are you also too anxious to sleep? Come say hi!,"Hello, fellow nighttime anxiety friends. If you guys want to chat in this thread as a distraction, go right ahead! You can say anything you want. I'll go first. I've been lying in bed trying to sleep for so long, but I'm too anxious. So allow me to tell you guys about the scones I hope to make sometime soon. I've never made them before, but I love scones so much. I found a recipe for blueberry scones with a lemon glaze, and I hope they taste as good as they sound. I'm going to get all the ingredients for them this week and hopefully bake them on the weekend."
45,Anxiety,Has this happened to anyone with somatic anxiety?,"I legitimately just told myself, ""hey I realised the tingling in my hands are gone"" and then they just came back."
46,Anxiety,I'm (26f) always creating scenarios in my head about my relationship and it hurts," 

Hello everyone (again),

I'm writing this because I've read almost everything in Google at this point and I can't be helped. Or I can't help myself. I'm currently in a relationship, fairly new. We've known each other for three months and made it official 2 weeks ago. This is my third relationship. Just a bit of context: my second relationship, my last one, was really complicated. I was with someone narcissistic who really ruined a bit of me. I already had fear of abandonment but it got worse as, after 2 years of dating, he said I love you in the night and the morning after told me ""I don't love you anymore."" WHILE WE WERE ON VACATION, BOTH OF US, IN ANOTHER COUNTRY. After a few realizations I told my therapist I suffered a bit of narcissistic abuse and I think I have a bit of PTSD.

Now I've met this guy, after 10 months of me and my ex broke up, and it has been amazing. He's the kindest human being I know. He's very honest (it seems - because my mind keeps telling me he's lying) and super nice and always makes sure he reassures me whenever I'm anxious, sad, or scared. It was really difficult in the beginning to even give him a bit of me and be vulnerable. But now that I've put my walls down so many fears are overcoming my head. I have this fear that his ex will come and ruin the relationship, begging him to come back (I have talked to him about this and he has said that they ended because it was HORRIBLE at the end and both knew it didn't work anymore. And we had a very mature conversation where he said that he wants to be with me that's why he wants to be in a relationship, to begin with, because if he wanted her he wouldn't even be meeting people let alone be in a relationship. The past is in the past and now I'm who's important to him). I'm really scared of that because in the past an ex was more important than me. Then I'm terrified he will stop liking me because I'm a very anxious person. The bottom of the question is that I'm terrified of hurting myself and looking ridiculous for giving someone a chance and breaking up a month after for example. And the more kind and warm he is to me every time I am like this, the more scared and ashamed I become.

And I know, if I'm here is because I know he likes me and I like him and if I accepted to be in a relationship I should just believe 100% in the person I'm in and hope for a bright future. But as I said I keep making scenarios every day and starting to get anxious and I can't keep asking for reassurance. I need strategies. (Yes I'm in therapy!)

Do you have any advice? Kind words? Strategies? A SLAP IN THE FACE FOR ME TO STOP SPIRALING."
47,Anxiety,I’m scared of dropping out of university but I don’t know what else to do. TW,"I’ve started crying every for about 6 hours a day since starting uni and I can’t sleep at all the nights before my lectures because because I’m way too anxious. When I’m there I don’t want to speak to anyone and I don’t want them to look at or speak to me. The whole day I’m there all i think about is going home or ending my life. I’ve also started self harming again. Every week we have to give presentations and i physically can’t do it, the first time i tried I couldn’t even get a single word out and the teacher just told me it’s okay i can sit down cause i was shaking so bad and on the verge of tears. My mum told me it’s okay to drop out but my dad is pissed and keeps saying going university will help my mental health and that i just need to be positive. I dunno if I should just keep going because i just don’t know what to do otherwise."
48,Anxiety,I feel like the healthcare system failed me for not catching my anxiety sooner and now I’m stuck,"I’ve had anxiety for as long as I remember and I’ve been socially isolated since elementary school (being the kid with no friends) I started developing severe anxiety in middle school I talked to my doctor and a therapist but found no solace or help my doctor handed me a piece of paper with check boxes the ones that are like never, sometimes, often always, and she also handed me one for depression but after looking at them for 2 seconds she basically told me you don’t have anxiety because you’re not depressed, and then I got a therapist which then downplayed my anxiety symptoms and told me I didn’t have anxiety because I don’t experience panic attacks, I told him I did have panic attacks during school, he then says it’s not a panic attack because I don’t run out of the classroom when experiencing it (also what kind of reasoning is that not everyone is going to do that for me I would leave the classroom if I could but I just wouldn’t run out like I’m already thinking about if I’d get sent to detention for leaving class or what other people would think and how It’d be embarrassing) I’ve never been officially diagnosed for anxiety and my mother was never really any help during these times she wasn’t really a good parent if I had to be honest, I came to her multiple times to take me to another doctor or therapist because I need help and she would shrug it off I got really depressed during high school and told her I wanted to kill myself during an argument and she said “talk to the school counselor then”, I’m 18 currently and my anxiety has gotten worse and worse ever since and I’ve never gotten any help I’m lost and I want to get help but I’m not even sure if I’m still on my mothers health insurance plan and I can’t call the health insurance provider to find out because of my anxiety, i struggle with making phone calls and it’s very hard to explain that to the people around me who say “just make this or that phone call” because it’s not that easy, it’s very difficult for me to talk to people I can’t look people in the face when talking to them like I use to, and I can only say a few words I can’t have a full conversation, when I’m experiencing terrible anxiety in a social situation where I have to talk to people I’ll start to have auditory hallucinations, my mouth is super dry, and I sweat like crazy, I hate being in super crowded and loud spaces because I’ll start to panic, I recently had to go to the grocery store and for some reason it was just jam packed with toddlers screaming everywhere I was so overwhelmed I pretty much ran out with only half of what I needed and started crying in the car. I feel so stuck and I feel betrayed by the health system and everyone around me for not helping me when my anxiety started when I was younger, I really wish that I was treated for my anxiety when I was at that young age because I wouldn’t be stuck where I’m at now"
49,Anxiety,Poor Nail Health,"Hi all

Has anyone notices a correlation between their finger nail health and their mental health? 

I’ve had an onset of daily anxiety since May and my nail health has deteriorated at the same time. They have become weak and brittle with some deep horizontal beau lines and also more but less pronounced vertical lines. 

Any help 

Thanks"

It's been a day now and I'm still worried I did something horrific that I don't remember doing and am wandering around coming up with scenarios in my head for what *could* have happened despite logically knowing that it couldn't in reality.

I'm walking around reassuring myself that I didn't do anything nuts.

54,Anxiety,I'm so scared.,"I don't know how I'm going to be alive much longer with my health and health phobia. I just woke up after sleeping a day away. Feel so tired and depressed, all of my anxiety is back. I'm feeling sick too and can barely walk I feel so weak. 

My eyes look like I got beat up they are so black and doomy looking. I cant even remember when I last took my medications or if I did. I can't remember the last two days even though I posted on this exact board like 300 times. I just want to break down and cry, I have no contact with and family or friends, and my wife is slowly giving up on me after 14 years. 

I just turned 30 and I feel like a lost child. I can't do things normal people can do my age. It's always a joke about how slow I am and how I can't remember anything, but I know it's all from decades of anxiety and depression slowly degrading my brain. I also have permanent long-term damage from past benzo abuse, I forget my ABC's and can barely string together sentences irl.

I'm going to do a rapid Covid test later to make sure I'm not sick. It would be a relief to know this feeling is coming from a sickness and not my mind. I feel so f'ing hopeless and drained. 

No I am not suicidal any would not self-harm. If anything the opposite, I'm desperate for my health and sanity back. Going to a Dr is not in question ever. I will die before facing my fear of medical treatment, a decade of every single type of possible help and thousand shelled out and I'm still not an inch above my fears.

Currently on 80MG of prozac, and have been tapering off benzos for years."
55,Anxiety,Dr Big Park reporting,"Hi guys. Thanks for having me..I'm a medical practitioner, mycologist, microbiologist, and flora fawner who has had a lot of experience with various natural remedies for various mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, PTSD and the likes. Over my years of study and research I've come to realise that most of the drugs out in pharmacies and hospitals aren't meant to deal with the problem at the root but instead to curb your condition, keep it tame enough so you have to keep taking more and more of these drugs. They're not made to treat but to manage, all thanks to Big Pharma. I'm sure most of us on here have taken all sorts of medication from doctors, nurses, therapists, pharmacies and the likes and we don't get much of a solution. What we get instead is a fix that last for some days and we get back to old ways only by that time we're already hooked on the medication and then have to take more and more but to no avail. 

   But guys, there's a cure for mental health conditions. And it's all around us but we're not allowed to know. Everything we need for our survival and care is on this earth.. mother Earth is the best mother there is. It's high time we as the super-fauna of the earth embrace the healing qualities of the flora. I've been able to fix up people with issues like depression, PTSD and anxiety and give them a new hope through these natural remedies. Mind you, these remedies are quite unorthodox and you might be shocked to the bone when you hear about them, but when you look up information about these treatments you'd see that you're not so far from the truth. I'm just a road sign on this journey of life leading you in the right direction. There's nothing more I'd like to see than people getting over their depression and anxiety because I know how that feels, especially from a personal level."
56,Anxiety,"Struggling, need someone to talk to",
57,Anxiety,"What a hell is going on with me… Severe anxiety, brain fog, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, losing train of thought… etc, and fear of developing psychosis","Hey everyone, hope you are staying strong… I am new here, 22 years old, I would like to share my story, since I feel desperate about my recent change in mental health and would like to talk to someone who can relate to my experiences.

About two months ago, I experienced a very ‘bad trip’ on weed (panic attack, shaking, sweating, it seemed like I would die from a heart attack) and ever since it happened, I stopped my almost 3-year daily abuse. Now it has been two months since I quit weed and drinking, but these two months were dreadful in terms of my mental health… Prior to that, I never experimented with other drugs than psychedelics such as shrooms and acid, I did LSD a couple of times, and my last trip three months ago also shook me quite hard.. Although I felt okay after it, I think a week later, I started feeling first symptoms of anxiety which developed further as time passed by.

As I quit weed, at first, for around two weeks, I experienced withdrawal symptoms such as panic attacks and constant anxiety, night sweats, insomnia, throbbing headaches at the back of my head, vivid dreams, and slight hppd symptoms (sensitivity to light, floaters, mild trailing, flashes of color). As time passed, most of the physical symptoms subsided (except pulsating headaches in the same spot), I was left with persistent anxiety and started to develop other mental issues.

Two months in, after quitting weed and changing my lifestyle, I feel accompanied with rather constant DP/DR, insane brain fog, difficulties to concentrate, very bad memory (I struggle hard to remember what I  was doing the day before, or sometimes I can’t remember a simple conversation I was having 10 minutes ago, and it concerns me a lot), difficulties to think clearly, or express myself, sometimes I lose train of thought in my head, and have jumping thoughts, etc. Due to those sensations, I am in constant anxiety and fear of developing psychosis or schizophrenia, and loosing everything I have reached so far.

While I manage to keep up with my daily responsibilites, and maintain social interactions, it has been difficult to so. I do not have any delusions, nor do I hear voices or see hallucinations, but the strange cognitive decline together with strong anxiety, fear of psychosis, and other sensations made me super sensitive to my surroundings, and sometimes make me check whether some of my senses are real. I had instances of hypochondria in early childhood, and I hope that this is the same case for me now, followed by something like PAWS from weed..

So that is how I feel today, and I am scared that this is the beginning of the end for me… For almost two months now I am clean off everything (except nicotine), and the only thing I am abusing are various supplements. I have scheduled my first appointment with a psychotherapist next week, hopefully that will help.

Did anyone go through anything similar? Please share, any help or suggestions would be appreciated!"
58,Anxiety,Knowing others have it worse than me,"Hey guys, ive been following this reddit for a while, and finally taken the courage to post my story and how i feel. 
Ive had panick attacks for 2 years now, im 20 and turning 21 in a week, and honestly, its not the fact that i have panic attacks often that kills me, its more so the fact that i feel like i need help, But at the same time i know that there’s a lot of people feeling worse than me, and i therefore push my problems Down. I experience panick attacks at night mostly which ruins my Day to Day life, i wont go to School or work when ive had a bad sleep, cus the fear of the anxiety and depression spiraling out of control is so huge. The feeling of impending doom is limiting me on that front as well. 
I am seeing a therapist ever week or 2 weeks, and ive been told that ive made progress, But the more my anxiety worsens just makes me feel like i have bigger set backs, than progress. I know my anxiety is not that bad as well, Because i Can honestly function normally in society for the most part, But when i have my bad episodes as well as depressive episodes, i just feel like i cant do it anymore. 
I Think my sleep issues come from a huge fire that we had in my House, which is probably Why to this Day still smell fire when im at my room, and sometimes have short flashback of this episode in my Day to Day life.
I havent been diagnosed at all, nor does my gp not want to prescribe me meds as of right now, since i Can function like a Human for the most part - even tho i experience massive dp/dr a few times a week, But something in me constantly tells me i need it, But again, the feeling of knowing im better off that others, is tearing me apart, since i hate pity and self pity. Also, it doesnt help that where i live the cost of a psychiatrist is ultra expensive, and the waiting time to get treatment for free through health Care is 2 years when its non urgent. 

Anyway, if u read through all of this, then Thank you. Just needed to vent a bit."
59,Anxiety,Waking up every morning in cold sweat,"For about as long as I can remember I’ve been waking up in the mornings pretty much 4/7 days a week in a constant cold sweat. I’ve never really pinpointed it’s cause but could definitely use some input.

I’ve been on antidepressants since I was 18, around 4 years ago and am currently taking 20mg Fluoxetine each day. However I have taken a wide variety of reuptake inhibitors before this. 

I’ve usually got a really awful sleeping pattern and find it super difficult to get to sleep (even when I’m feeling naturally tired), I am a daily weed smoker for around 2 years and ex benzo abuser. I’ve found in recent times my anxiety is essentially non existent with the combo of Fluoxetine and Passionflower Extract, but I still can’t seem to pinpoint the cause of the bad sleep. I’ve tried all of the normal things as well such as not drinking before bed, no screens 60 mins before sleep etc but to no avail. 

Anyone else have/had the same issue?"

66,Anxiety,is it invalid to take a day off from school because of anxiety,"i usually worry or stress over practically everything (it’s like my mind is never resting) but school definitely worsens my anxiety to the max. i’m a junior and i feel like i’m never able to relax. the minute i wake up i’m thinking what i have to do when i get to school and i make a mental list as i go on with my day about the assignments i have to get done, the classes i have to study for, how much time i should spend on each assignment, etc. by the time i get home i’m exhausted. i’ll tend to work on my assignments until 10-11 but sometimes this turns into 12-1 or more. even though this schedule seems bad it seems to work for someone like me who tends to work more effectively at night. but still i worry i’m not doing enough or i’m falling behind ( even if i’m not ). this morning i woke up perfectly fine and actually the opposite of sleep deprived. but as i started to get dressed and put on my makeup i started overanalyzing literally everything about myself. then i started thinking about how i didn’t like going to school and how i have all these assignments i have to do. and how i have all these quizzes to study for. it just kind of piled on me all at once and i felt an attack coming on (heavy breathing, sweating, not being able to think) and i realized i was going to be late for school if i didn’t leave soon. my attack lasted for about 8 mins and it left me with 6 mins to get to school on time so i decided not to go at all and just take the day to relax and reset. is this a childish thing to do like giving in to your anxiety almost??"

I have even questioned whether I’m actually dumb or what’s the case, it’s my 6th time!!! I can’t pass it I have tried everything study by myself study in classes studied online read books.

The community is also amazing. Everyone uplifts each other. I honestly have a hard time being honest with my feelings but it feels so easy with them.

If your looking for something to help calm you down, relax, focus, or just take some time to play with the cute cat in the app, it's for you. I highly recommend it. I'm pretty sure it's available on most devices through the app store."

70,Anxiety,can't figure out,"I suck at explaining, It's been happening for a long time and i always just ignored it, Never tried to think about it or never tried to figure out what it was. As a guy, most of the time I tried to speak to someone about anxiety, my problems and all, it just gets ignored or taken too lightly, i don't know why, and i thought it could be a place to dump it all (not sure). 5 years back, i started feeling lonely and weird but I chose to ignore it. And then begins the sleeplessness, and explain it is soo dumb, it was like , i am too tired , want to sleep , trying to sleep ,my eyes are hurting but still can't sleep. It was like the brain was constantly thinking and thinking instead of being shut down. 
Few years later, the problem increased and i rarely felt happy. All i wanted is to wake up in a good mood , i started to keep myself busy and somehow that became my habit, just keep yourself busy so you don't think. 
I hate how my mind works, it's like frontend and backend of a brain, frontend is all the stuff I know and happening rn, backend is something my brain is thinking then even i Don't know, hence the reason of being sad/anxious for absolutely no reason. Like I'm having a great time and suddenly sadness out of nowhere.
Then i got used to it, used to feel neutral, no expressions no feelings for someone (not even my close ones), not wanting any partner. 

I thought getting out of college and getting a job would fix this , i got a great job and started living by myself but the problem is still there. I live alone now , no family, no friends yet. So it got a little worse. 
I haven't cried in years , i don't even remember last time i cried, and now i feel like crying all the time and i try to but still nothing happens, all i feel is a heavy throat. I don't know if someone would read this but if you did , thankyou."
71,Anxiety,Too afraid to book appointment,"(17F) I’ve been going to therapy for nearly 7 months now for social-anxiety/anxiety and low self-esteem, I haven’t gotten the results that I wanted so my therapist suggested medication.

I wanna send an apology email but idk if that’s weird or not since the email wasn’t specifically targeted. What if they didn’t even see me on my phone and now I’m exposing myself? I had a mini meltdown when I saw the email bc I hate being in trouble/seen as disinterested, having an anxiety spike over it."
73,Anxiety,Soes anyone else experience this?,"Throughout the day I will have random spikes of severe anxiety and its typically over something very small, or worse I dont even know why, it just happens. 

This has been happening for the past week or so and I genuinely have no idea why, but it is a terrible feeling."
74,Anxiety,everyone around me is too normal,"I don’t know why but I just can’t be like normal people. Because to be honest, I believe that there is no such thing as normal because we’re all different but I can’t help feeling that way. I feel like an outcast all the time and none of my interests are similar to any of my schoolmates. I can’t be outdoors too long or else I’ll have the worst panic attack while my classmates are having the time of their lives going out with each other. 

I don’t have any friends no matter how hard I try to socialize. I just feel so different but not in a way that it makes me unique or anything. I am so so quiet yet I sometimes hyperfixate on the most random things that people have to call me out for it. I’m just really not meant to be here. 

I am seeing my therapist in a couple days and I think I’m going to consult her regarding ADHD. I’m not self diagnosing but it would be nice to know what she thinks."
75,Anxiety,Fear of being seen/known? Need advice.,"I’ve always had anxiety ever since I was a kid but I think it manifested in high school. I used to be known for obsessing about a book series to the point where I couldn’t do anything if I didn’t associate it with that book. And one day I was talking to a classmate about a sequel book I was writing and she blindsided me when she told me it sounded stupid. It was the first time that I really realized that others could see me in a negative light. Another time at my church my pastor used me as an example in the lesson about how obsessive I was about this book series and we need to be like that for God.

I understand what he meant and it wasn’t intended as a bad thing but I still felt as if all eyes were on me. And I grew embarrassed by my obsession (hyper fixation? Idk) and I stopped enjoying the book because I felt like I was known for it. That my obsession was all people knew or saw about me.

This also manifests in shame about past mistakes where if someone knew me from childhood I want to avoid because I’m afraid of what they think. Or if I enjoy something then share about it, if someone else doesn’t like the thing then for some reason they don’t like me. I know it’s irrational.

The most recent case is that I went to a play with someone I knew and it was really good. I cried a lot during the show but this person kept side eyeing me and elbowed me because to them the emotion I was feeling didn’t match what was on stage. I told them that my personality doesn’t match hers but they couldn’t understand why I was so emotional during the show. I felt embarrassed. 

I went to the show the next night cause I wanted to enjoy the show without anyone judging me… but after the show some of the actors came to me in the lobby (community theater) and told me they saw me the past two nights and they loved my response to their performances. And they told me they all talked about me backstage. 

I know they meant it as a good thing… but I’m embarrassed. I was in a crowd of 200 people. Was I the only one emotionally invested? It doesn’t help that when I was trying to talk about it with the person I went with the first night and they implied that I was emotional for their attention. I admit it felt good at the time when the actors told me they enjoyed an emotional connection, but I never intended that! I never met these people before the show and I wasn’t seeking their approval. I was just enjoying the show…

I just feel embarrassed that people can interpret whatever they want from looking at me. And even when I’m with close friends I fear how they perceive me. I’d rather be isolated than be known and judged by other people’s perception cause I have no control over how others can interpret me.

The actors were so kind about my emotional response to the show. The main guy even has become mutuals with me on Instagram. Most of the main cast accepted my friend request on Facebook. But now they see my account. Now they can perceive whatever they want about me. And I have no reason to fear their perception but I do. And I wouldn’t have even thought about it if it wasn’t for the person I went with pointing me out that first night. Like Which is it? Am I an embarrassment to those around me or not? It’s so frustrating having two conflicting perceptions clashing like this.

I fear the perception of everyone. I enjoy cosplay because I can be someone else for a day and people expect a character and no one can know me. 

I have anxiety I know… but I think this goes beyond that. Maybe it’s a phobia or something. I don’t know but I can’t live like this. I’m tired of being scared and embarrassed of how others see me all the time. What can I do? Any advice would be appreciated."
76,Anxiety,Is there anything that’ll work without awful side effects ?,"Do all antidepressants, cause, insomnia, and for you to lose your mind at first, because it makes it nearly impossible on top of all the other side effects for me to make it through them but I always end up giving up and I feel so weak but like I also want to feel better, so how do people do this?
I feel like I’m backtracking. I’m waking up with a panic. It’s making me feel worse than I’ve ever felt no matter what I try. I started these because of physical symptoms, but I don’t know if it’s worth it anymore. 
I just needed advice from people who’ve been through it because people to this no problem every day without a second thought, so why is it so hard for me?
Thanks for the advice !"
77,Anxiety,Waking up in the night,"For about two weeks now I’ve been struggling to keep myself asleep for any solid periods of time longer than 2 hours.

While I’m asleep I always wake up eyes fucking giant out of nowhere, and I feel like my heart’s gonna explode and I literally have to wheeze out a panic attack to the side before I can even think of trying to get back to sleep; and sometimes it takes me a while

Does anyone else have this problem? I’m medicated. If I need to clarify anything lmk."
78,Anxiety,struggling through burnout and breakdowns,"hi everyone. I (20F) have been suffering from GAD for as long as I can remember and feel like I'm at my breaking point. I've been in college for 3 years and am majoring in history education. I financially support myself, but just barely, through my part-time job. I feel like I have to do absolutely everything or else I won't succeed in life, but it's wearing me so incredibly thin. I have no time to even sleep and I'm driving myself crazy. I'm scared that my whole life I will be miserable I am now, working, student teaching, and going through the same cycle every day. I barely see my friends because when I'm not working or at school, I'm too anxious to make plans with them.

I feel like I don't know myself but I don't even have the time to figure out who I am. I'm going through an identity crisis and my GAD is certainly not helping. How am I expected to maintain this balancing act? i really do not know what to do anymore and any advice is appreciated."
79,Anxiety,Can’t pin it,"I feel like I’m constantly searching for the reason my anxiety flares up (everyday). Yesterday I had a series of difficult conversations, one with a friend, another with my child’s father, and one with the school counselor. I am a stay at home mom, struggling to figure out how to function in the world again, recovering from betrayal trauma, just had surgery, trying to manage to stay on top of life but it just seems to get on top of me time and time again.

I obsess about what it is that triggers my anxiety but in truth I feel it’s just everything. Today I wanted to get out of the house but the thought just gives me major anxiety. I’m struggling to do anything good for myself and if I rest or take a minute to breathe I just feel like a complete failure as I review my day like a bad movie. I’m on Zoloft and take lorazepam but I still feel like an insane person. I am getting exhausted from all the overthinking, tired of feeling this weight. I feel dependent on medication that doesn’t even seem to be helping..I guess I just need some words of encouragement or validation that I’m not crazy. I miss the person I thought I was. I don’t even recognize myself anymore."
80,Anxiety,Eye anxiety,i’m F17 and i’ve had this issue for a while. i was convinced i was going blind or loosing vision in my right eye a few months ago so i went to an optometrist and they did all the tests and looking you can possibly do and they said my eye is perfectly fine. i’ve started to worry maybe i have a blood clot in my brain causing pressure on my eye and maybe making everything seem like it’s fading out into the blackness. would that have been picked up? or am i crazy. they said my periferhal and everything was fine but i’m very worried because i always notice my vision isn’t as good as my other eye. i’m spiraling in panic and i don’t know what to do. i’ve also been getting headaches and weird pressury feeling in my eyes and ears and head line a migraine almost and i’m freaking out. please help me
81,Anxiety,Weed Induced Anxiety Disorder,"I need somebody's help who's experienced or saw someone close to you experience this. 
After smoking weed occasionally for over a year, one night at home had a terrible panic attack(my first encounter and the first time i acknowledged this) doctors prescribed me antidepressants. I denied the fact that i could have something called as anxiety so i refused to take the meds. Smoked again a few days later only to have a bad trip again. Took me nearly a week to get out of it(maybe anti depressents did work). The doctors diagnosed me with substance use disorder and said the anxiety was just the withdrawal. It didn't stop even after a month, still had that uncomfortable feeling which i never had before or maybe it was because i started messing my brain up that something was wrong with me. Started smoking pot again for few months, took a break, started having the same problems, consulted another doc, didn't complete his treatment And again smoked pot. This has been going on for a year now and i have neither completed any course of treatment from a single doctor nor have i stopped weed for more than a week. 

Now, according to some docs i have a genetic history of mental illness and smoking weed surfaced it. They say it Cannibis Induced Anxiety Disorder. 
I never felt a small tint of anxiety, not once before this. Is it my fault i spiralled down and subconsciously created this problem? Is it the weed addiction? Or is it the meds the docs prescribed which i never completed? Or is it really what the docs say a cannibis induced anxiety disorder?

If you've read all of this, please do help me out."
82,Anxiety,So tense... Hope this ends some day,"I just had to talk on the phone to the coordination woman from the home support service that I have... Nicest and most pleasant person ever, gonna give us exactly what we asked, but somehow it made me so extremely uncomfortable, like crawling out of my skin... so tense and even holding my breath, pacing and all....

I really hope this gets better. I've been doing everything to confront it (exposure) for the last couple of months but it's still extremely difficult..."
83,Anxiety,brown noise,"I suffer so badly with health anxiety/death anxiety. I suffer real bad with the physical symptoms of it, no medication can help me as I've tried. But one thing I can say that has helped me is Brown Noise on YouTube. I feel instantly relaxed, I usually fall asleep within 5 minutes of listening to it or feel sleepy. Just a tip if anyone would like to try it themselves. It helps me to focus, breathe and stay calm!"
84,Anxiety,Constant thoughts. ocd need help,"So im doing a challenge in a game and everytime I do something bad I have to load the game. the problem is I loaded even two times back instead of recent load but my mind says nop. you “probably” did something bad (I say probably because I dont even think i did something but my mind keeps telling me I did) now it wants me to start the game all over when I already spent some time on it. should I continue or start again? 

I put health tag because idk what to put."
85,Anxiety,"Fear about making a mistake, fear I will ""get in trouble""","I have this fear specifically around financial forms--it's hard for me to even START them (taxes, FAFSA, etc) becuase of my overwhelming fear that i will fuck it up. About 3 years ago, I had an issue with the IRS (not my fault, and SEEMED like not a big deal) that took 2 years to resolve and thousands of dollars. ANd I had this terrible fear BEFORE that, so now it's super compounded as my worst fears DID come true and it was awful.

How can i get over this? I generally just white-knuckle my way through, but it's awful."
86,Anxiety,When anxiety warps the meaning of other people's words,"I snapped at my parents today, something I never do because I deeply love &amp; respect them and have always been respectful of their wishes.   
My parents knew that I was going on a work trip out of town for the weekend. My Dad texted me to ask me for help with something 'when I have time' on Saturday, and I said I was out of town until Sunday evening. He texted me to ask if I was back yet on Sunday morning and I reminded him I was back Sunday evening. I called Monday to ask exactly what it was about and he said it was about and he said it was better if I just come over to their house. I was deeply tired, stressed, still running errands, but he asked ""Don't you have the day off after working all weekend?"" and I was taken aback -- whatever it was, he really must want me to help, I thought. 

""It's not important, it can wait until next weekend,"" he's said, but now I'm anxious and stressed. I weigh out if I should go to their house or rest, and my body clearly says it wants rest. But anxiety makes my brain weigh out ""How much do I love my family?"" and ""Isn't my fatigue less important than their well being?"" and of course, love for family \*ALWAYS\* outweighs my condition so I go. And it turns out they're not in any kind of emergency, they just want me to write a complaint for them (their English isn't that good) about their neighbour's drumming. And even that, they said, actually, never mind, don't do it yet, let's wait until the weekend. And my face just falls. i think they realize I am absolutely pissed off. What part about this was ""it's better to explain it to you when you come over""? Here, I thought it was complicated medical documents or something and it turns out to be a complaint they're not even sure they want to make. 

I got so stressed and anxious I couldn't even sleep that night. I am never disrespectful to my parents but yesterday I let my irritation show fully and I think it really upset them. 

But it's also my fault as my dad did say it's not urgent despite his repeated attempts to get me to come over. Anxiety makes me dig under the surface and interpret their messages as ""actuallly important and urgent"" when it's not. I was so defeated. And when my partner says it was ""peaceful"" without me, I interpreted this negatively and said I bet he wishes I was away for a lot longer, and he got upset at me for saying that. I dig into the negative meaning of people's words due to anxiety. Anyone else have this issue?"
87,Anxiety,Reminder.,"You can’t always get what you want, and that’s ok."
88,Anxiety,Experiencing Light Headedness,"This isn’t a new symptom for me, I’ve had it come and go in the past and have been able to pay it no mind usually.

However this came on four days ago and it’s been pretty bad, my anxiety is very high at the moment and the lightheaded ness almost takes me to panic. It’s very debilitating to the point I can’t leave the house now. I went to my van earlier and it looked as if it was swaying.

My hydration, eating and sleeping have been very poor due to this panic disorder relapse, I’ve stopped taking my propranolol because I know that can cause dizziness. Haven’t taken it for 2 days and my resting heart rate is still 56.

Just very scared I’m going to allow this lightheaded sensation consume me and it’ll be permanent"
89,Anxiety,Sometimes the meds just... don't work. Anyone else?,"Yesterday night I had an Atarax (25mg) to calm down before bed and while utterly zoning out from it on the bed I felt a slight leg-pain and immediately freaked out (bad, bad health anxiety) and I flew straight into a crying-my-eyes-out panic attack, and that happens a lot. It's like, the meds help my baseline anxiety (doesn't eliminate all the symptoms but certainly makes me not carea), but it does heck-all for an actual attack when they happen.

Does anyone else get this? Maybe Atarax just ain't doing it for me. I know it's on the ""low-tier"" end of these kinda meds, but it always felt like it's helped in the past."
90,Anxiety,Anxiety doubting your happiness,Why does this happen? You’re feeling more in calm and all of a sudden the anxiety goes “oh but are you really happy?”. It’s weird
91,Anxiety,I hate anxiety,so my moms best friends son needed a specialist that could prescribe him anxiety meds and do check ups and all that. well my brother used to go to a doctor like that so my mom told her to take him to the same guy. she was telling me the whole story and how she was so happy she could help them find a doctor. yet i’m over here struggling more than I ever have. I’ve given up on even trying to tell her how I feel but she knows how bad my anxiety is. she won’t let me take meds because of ONE bad experience on a. she’s always preaching how she wishes she could help me yet does nothing to actually help me. she won’t help me find a good therapist she won’t let me go to the doctor or go on meds. yet she’ll help someone else’s kid. my anxiety is so bad my life is being ruined and she couldn’t care less. It’s so exhausting telling someone how you feel and they just dont care. she always either changes the subject when I explain my anxiety or she tells me to just not think like that. I get it she’s going through things too but as my mother who claims she cares so much you’d think she’d try and help me a little more. I even feel selfish for saying that. I know i’m not the only thing that matters but while everyone else is getting help i’m still in the same boat and honestly it’s drowning.
92,Anxiety,Anxiety or Intuition?,"I really need advice because I don't know, I and truly believe I could be overthinking this. 

I got a job and its been a few months now. We work remotely, and I do love my job. Before, everything seemed fine, more than great. 

This is what I noticed: 
Since we utilize Teams Instant messaging, we react to eachothers messsages and response. My coworkers &amp; boss would always react to my messages and respond back to me quickly. Lately I noticed that no one even acknowledges my messages (no response, no reaction.) but they seem to do it whenever other members or the boss in group has something to say. I feel like something has changed in the group dynamic. And I brought up the fact that I don't feel connected to my coworkers to my boss and she each in their own  spoke to them they both said everything was good. 

I am still new so theres questions that I have, and because I dont feel like bothering my coworkers I dont ask them anymore. 

Also, there was an example last week where I messaged my coworker &amp; hes always the first to like my boss messages, and i noticed he didn't even respond back to me and he messaged me regarding something else not answering my question. 

For reference, I got fired at my old job because my boss and coworkers didn't like my personality. 

Am I overthinking it or are they showing me that I am not liked? I have been crying and feeling extremely upset about work. Do I need to seek therapy?"
93,Anxiety,Why do all anxiety “cures” contain things that give me anxiety?,"My anxieties have gotten rather hard to cope with recently. Yet all the things I’m told to do, or try to make things better, are so full of things that cause me deep anxieties. For example, going out and socialising, exercising, trying new things? The cycle is never ending, how do you beat something when you don’t have the energy or will power to even try?

It’s like I’m living in self-destruct mode, I don’t want to do things because I’m anxious, yet to get over my anxieties I have to do things? 

It sounds so easy but it feels so impossible to me right now, I’ve pushed everyone away because they keep attempting to get me out. The truth is I don’t want to get out, I want to stay in, and feel safe, and out of peoples way…

I feel broken beyond repair, but I also don’t want to repair myself. I don’t know if I am explaining it right, but surely it’s more common of a feeling than I expect?

So my question is… Can you get over anxiety without having to feel anxious in the process (or at least lesser amounts of anxiety)?"
94,Anxiety,internal buzzing/vibrating?,"I've been super stressed with health anxiety. I've been having these buzzing/vibrating/internal tremors in my lower left abdomen/pelvic area.

They come and go in waves. It feels like a cellphone is buzzing inside me. It lasts like 2-3 seconds and go happen every few seconds for a few minutes or even up to an hour. There can also be times where i don't feel it at all. 

Had some blood work done, did and endoscopy and colonoscopy and was diagnosed with gastritis mild. This all started when i was stressing over biopsy results and now i cant shake it. Been almost a week now."
95,Anxiety,I feel like I'm being constantly watched by my parents.,"TL;DR
I work in a family business, so my parents and me are all at the same place at work. Today went to a cafe right opposite to our workplace, to have some pancakes. While i waiting for my food, i got a call from my mom, she asked me where I am, i told her I'm at the cafe, she said she can see me, and she's asking why am I simply sitting there with my phone, and she said that if dad sees me he will get angry. I felt so uncomfortable, I'm 24 years old and my parents have a problem with me taking a break. 

This made me realise how bad it is, it's not the first time something like this has happened, several times before this my parents have asked me why am i always on the phone. There are cameras at the workplace, sometimes they sit and watch. This one time i was at work. And my dad sent me a screenshot of me sitting on my phone and he questioned me. I use my phone only when I have nothing to do. When I have work, i do it. 
No matter where I am, i always feel like they'll be watching me somehow, when i go out with friends i worry about my parents passing by, when I'm in my room at night, even tho they're asleep, i keep getting worried about them barging in. 
My life is already miserable because of them, i have other anxiety issues because of them, and now this. It really feels like a prison with no way out."
96,Anxiety,How do I cope with anxiety of parents aging,"Hi. I am 21 years old. I struggle with general anxiety as well as health anxiety. My health anxiety extends to my parents health too. Even if I notice any little change on them I start freaking out (I sometimes freak them out too because I look visiby stressed out :( )
For example,  I saw my mom's eye was a bit red and started obsessing and stressing out about that. How do I cope :( 
Is there anybody struggling with the same? Please share some tips"
97,Anxiety,I think I have a problem with disappointing others.,"For reference, I had a great childhood, but often times I did feel like my parents were hard on me. I didn’t feel like they fully understood the fact that I had anxiety, and I was neurodivergent. My parents are in their 50s, so mental health, anxiety etc was not talked about as we know. 

Anyway, I am a business owner, and I have began obsessing about messing up. I don’t sleep well because I’m afraid I won’t wake up in time, I worry I’m going to make people upset with choices I make. I worry I’m going to bother my neighbors with my noise (I play music and sound proofed my suite but I’m still scared I’ll get in trouble.) I over analyze, I obsess and can’t stop thinking about it. I’ve never made a mistake like this before, so the idea that it’ll happen just makes me spiral. 

Do I need therapy? Why am I like this? Is it because I care and want to people please?"
98,Anxiety,medication for anxiety,I (F20) just recently had an intake for therapy and during the intake I was told that my anxiety seems severe enough for medication. I’ve battled anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. Im nervous about starting medication and how it could make me feel. Has anyone been put on medication for anxiety? How did it make you feel? Did you have any negative side effects?
99,Anxiety,physical symptoms?,im 21 and been struggling with GAD for most of my life. it flared up terrible in the past year or so and im the worst ive ever been. im working on myself but the damn physical symptoms of anxiety are hard to shift. i struggle with stomach issues and i have awful emetephobia which isnt a great combination. the anxiety nausea/stomach pains/diarrhoea are the bain of my life. any tips to get over it?
100,Anxiety,Anyone anxious about dying in some way.,"For instance, what if in a week a asteroid hits earth and kills everyone off? What if aliens come and kill us all or enslave us? What if I wake up tommorow with Cancer? What if I have another panic attack?

Luckily I don't have these thoughts 24/7 but they are still rather common, how do you deal with the unknown, more specifically what the future holds?

Yes I know think positive and everything will be OK, but life isn't a fairytale."
101,Anxiety,What can a person do when they are suffering from an anxiety attack? Should they go to the ER?, Is there like a special emergency hospital or doctor that can treat them if their current Psychiatrist can't see them?
102,Anxiety,Realized too late that she had feelings for me.,"Long one sorry
So personal story time, in middle school I was the weird kid....yup that one. As usual I thought no one liked me and was alone for the majority of it, it's a miracle I didn't develop anxiety or depression sooner. 

Anyways there was this semi popular girl that supposedly had a crush on two guys, one being this other kid that's not important, and the other one she never told anyone. She ended up asking out the former guy and the two started dating, up until high school.

In highschool I decided for some reason to reach out some old friends and I reached out to her for some reason, since we did hang out alittle I think? My memory is a bit fuzzy when it comes to middle school. I do remember we teased each other alot at least.

I reached out to her and we caught up with everything that's changed, we were in our second year of highschool at this point so it's been about two years. We actually started texting frequently, and she even invited me to her 15 or 16 birthday party.

Let me say that party was a blast, yet looking back I wish I was more expressive and less to myself. We were having fun, and there were some other old friends from middle school.

Then it happened, after the party she got into a small argument with her father, and honestly most of us just stayed out of it. She was alone in her backyard, and I decided to go and talk to her. 

I know you guys are gonna hate me but I don't remember much about this, although I do remember we hugged so I guess I comforted her in some way. We then went back to our friends.

I later found out that I was the other guy she was considering dating in middle school. She chose the other guy because some of her friends told her that was a better option. I've texted her a couple times in instagram a few years ago at the start of college but then we just both stopped all of a sudden. I want to text her back but I'm scared of what she'll say or think, especially since she has a boyfriend now. 

Writing this down is giving me depression, I used to actually make attempts with people when I wasn't consumed by anxiety and depression. I was just too stupid to put together alot of pieces."
103,Anxiety,Hyper fixating. What’s real and what’s anxiety?,"I’ve struggled with anxiety for 15 years and have been off medication for about 4 years now. I do okay with a few bad days here and there but for the last month I’ve been really struggling. Any headache I have I assume it’s something way worse, and weird symptom I’m feeling, dizziness, brain fog, pins and needles, muscle spasm they trigger my anxiety and I hyper fixate on whatever it is on the moment. Today my cousin made some amazing French onion soup with melted cheese. My 3 year old son fell and as I jumped up to grab him I swallowed funny. Since I have felt like the cheese is stuck in my throat. I have thrown up, drank water, drank soda, eaten various foods and I still have the sensation but I feel like it’s in my head? Anyone else have issues like this and how do you stop hyper fixating on them?"
104,Anxiety,Meds for anxiety other than benzos?,"Benzos are the only thing that really work. 
I’ve tried hydroxyzine, propranolol. 
I already take an SSRI for long term management. It keeps me stable, but my anxiety and obsessions are still really bad and it’s affecting my ability to interact with others. 

I have somewhat of an addictive personality, so I don’t know if my psychiatrist will give me a benzo even though they work. 
Has anything else worked for you?"
105,Anxiety,I’m skyrocketing rn and I can’t get it to stop.,"My anxiety is just fuckin kickin right now. I’m at my boyfriends house and I don’t wanna bother him with it right now. Don’t get me wrong I always tell him how I’m feeling but right now I’m just spiraling and don’t want to talk. I will talk to him later.

Distract me please?"
106,Anxiety,So I have severe anxiety most of the month due to my menstrual cycle and the only thing that helps is a benzo like klonopin. I’m on 2mg dose but I want to ween off cause I hear horror stories. Has anyone here takin klonopin for years daily and it has helped them and they are fine?,
107,Anxiety,I’m in my 40s and I just started bringing my childhood plush animal to bed again and it’s really helping.,"My first ever stuffed animal buddy I had when I was a kid was a floppy eared doggy with a big brown nose that I lovingly named Little Mutt. He was my absolute best friend in the world and we were inseparable. Well…until I became a teenager and then he was off to storage. About ten years ago, my mom passed away and while we were going through her belongings I found that she kept Little Mutt for me. And I’ve kept him with me since. And in those years my anxiety has grown astronomically. Crippling mornings. Nausea. Lack of interest. More tears than I ever thought I’d shed. It all kinda came to a head a few weeks ago and I was desperate for some help and then…I saw my buddy. I hugged him. I talked to him. I cried to him. And he helped me sleep. Helped me calm down. And now most nights he shares the bed with my wife and I. He’s really helping. If you guys have something from your youth that made you happy, made you smile, made you safe, bring it out and spend some time with it. Might help you out. Good night, friends."
108,Anxiety,Fear of getting injured,"Hi, so a couple months ago I cut my finger with a bread knife, it wasn't too bad in the end except that it did hurt like hell and that I needed 3 stiches.
Though ever since that accident, I always fear I'm gonna cut myself again when I have to use knives, but it also extends to other more evasive thoughts like if I'd break something or fall from a certain height.
Has anyone here experienced something similar? How do you deal with thoughts or fears like those?"
109,Anxiety,Hydroxyzine to Trazodone,"I've been taking Hydroxyzine on occasion for 25mg or less. I usually take it on night and it helps to some extent, though i get anxious in taking it sometimes considering i would have weird sensations in my head (rarely) and it would sometimes spook me. My doctor prescribed to me Trazodone and considering it is a ""sleeping pill"" from what i researched, I'm a bit timid in taking this considering i don't know what to expect, not to mention my anxiety has been bad for a while now, not sure if it has to do with my ear infection (considering that it probably is infected but i don't know considering i haven't gotten it properly checked) due to the fact that i would have weird sensations in my head and feel like i would lose my conscious any moment now, but only when my anxiety is bad (example : BPM past 140, vision problems, etc). It's honestly scary how i be experiencing all these symptoms, i fear that it could be a brain tumor or some sort but its probably all because of my ears being infected, who knows. Not to mention my eyes would sometimes hurt if i feel like an anxiety attack coming, headaches is also common but it isn't as bad as i expect.

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah, sorry for the off topic wall of text, has anyone taken Trazodone, and if so, does it help? What should i expect?"
110,Anxiety,I think im having a panic attack but im not quite sure,"My Chest Hurts im not sure if its my Lungs or Heart, everytime i lay down and try to sleep my chest starts to hurt more, im very tired and cant.
I hope its only a really bad panic attack to be quite honest"
111,Anxiety,Is an ecg usually good enough to rule out heart issues when dealing with anxiety?," 

23 male 5ft 11 145 lbs

I had an ecg 3 months ago at the start of some bad panic attacks which made me like hyper focus on my heart. Everyone says its fine but im still worried. I guess Im finally starting to believe it really just is anxiety but I just wanna make sure and see if like just having an ecg is good enough.

My main concerns are that my heart feels too loud, too fast, too reactive. On a bad day my resting rates are 70-80, standing rates are 90-110, and late night rates are like low 60s high 50s.

On a good day my resting rates are 60-70, standing about 80-90 and late nights like low 50s.

When like anxious or panicking it could be like anywhere between 110 to I think maybe like 150s. Im not too sure I never really measure when actively panicking but some few times I measure as Im just coming off the adrenaline rush and its like 140s. While anxious and going up the stairs I caught it being 135 once.

On standing I feel it spike and pound, and on sitting I sometimes feel it like get sluggishly slow?

I also noticed sometimes my heart will be like slow but super hard and other time itll be like weak but kinda fast? like weak but 90-110 or hard but 60-70s.

is that normal variation?

Another thing I noticed is that my panics and heart fear start in june. could it be the rise in heat made my heart pump a bit more and this plus the stress and anxiety made me more aware?

And now that its cooling down my body is slowing down and im just less anxious because its less pronounced?

Also sometimes I feel my heart have like slower beats or faster beats? like it'll speed up or slow down? have a slower beat and then steady or like 1 or 2 faster beats?

Ive had like heart palpitations all my life but I think I've just been more aware of it all?

are those irregular beats?

The thing is a couple days ago I was super fatigued cuz I guess my body was out of adrenaline and my heart felt like calm and chill for the duration. This kinda made me accept that it wasn't some arrhythmia or electrical issues since Id imagine those would have kept on going?? but instead my heart was kinda slow and chillin and I was tired af.

But today my body rested up and I had a nightmare and the increase and high reactivity kinda came back.

I also have chest tightness, shortness of breathe which actually has been getting better recently, chest muscle spasms, and chest and arm pains.

The thing with the pains and spams is I get them on both sides, but when its on my right I dont give a shit but when its on my left thats all I can think about.

I've been anxious about walking because I worry my heart goes up and then my cehst gets hella tight.

I've been anxious about doing any like muscle straining activities because I dont wanna like over do it on my heart? Like at one point opening a bag of chips was like ""oh shit hope it doesn't spike my heart rate"". its gotten better but still....

Im scared of walking on stairs since they make my breathing heavy and heart pound. from what Ive been told this is normal for stairs but even then the normal act of the increase makes me panic which makes my symptoms worse.

The point is I feel like Im slowly coming down the wave of bullshit and I just wanna be sure. Is getting my heart stethoscoped, doing the inhale and exhale on the like 4 points on my back and front, while the doc was holding my wrist, and having an ecg done good enough for this?

also this was done at the start of june so like 4 months ago. is that recent enough to make sure im still heathy and good? No one in my family wants to help since they're adamant that its all in my head and I dont have a way to pay for it myself.

Like at what point are stress tests, blood tests, holters, echos needed?

Is a general vital check and ecg good enough for this I guess?

Thanks"
112,Anxiety,I’ve made it 119 days without Paxil. Trying to convince myself to make it to day 120.,"Is anyone else in here struggling without medication after being on it for a while? 

I was on Paxil for 6 years, and made the decision with my therapist to try and take on life without it (I weaned myself VERY slowly over 4 months). Since being completely off, it’s been 119 days of anxiety, panic attacks, stomach aches, crying, sleepless nights. My body hurts. I feel completely defeated. 

I’ve tried the breathing techniques. ALL the coping skills I’ve learned over the past 5 years of therapy and I just feel so overwhelmed."
113,Anxiety,Life sucks :/,"Ykno what really sucks about anxiety? The fact you have a feeling that is like you've just been jumpscared. Anxiety is basically like being scared 24/7 and the feeling it leaves is. Yknow the biggest fucking thing tho? The fact my Anxiety doesn't even have a reason to exist.

My depression, I understand. My anxiety? Have no fucking clue where and why it became an illness. I hate this feeling of something is inside my chest or like I'm worried. It's hard to describe, but I'll just say that I feel a feeling of being scared"
114,Anxiety,I’m so anxious every day and idk I just felt like this posting this,"Look, I’m depressed as hell. Anxious every day. Tired. All the chemicals in my body are just jacked up. If you read this you might say “why the hell did you post this?” Well I posted it because I don’t care and it actually feels a little good to type it out and put it out for anyone in the world to see. 

I started a new job in a new career field 6 weeks ago. I’m good at the job, but I’m incredibly anxious and stressed about it every day. Every day when the work day ends my vision starts to blur, my eyes feel dry, I have a cough, I am very drowsy, and am fairly prone to headaches. The job is not incredibly difficult or anything and not physically demanding, but I stress over it a lot because I care. At first I thought I was dehydrated every day but recently I’ve been trying very hard to hydrate so I don’t think that’s the case. Maybe I’m getting so stressed out and when work is over and I can let go of that stress I crash. I’m still trying to figure it out but that’s my best guess. Every day I struggle to eat enough food. It’s hard for me to want to eat food but also everything just sounds bad to me. So I’ve been eating anything that might sound delicious in the moment and I’m getting very poor nutrition. Some extra stress could be added by the fact that I’m still not making enough money to provide for my family effectively. 

Also, did I mention that I just had my first child? I’ve been married for a few years and we just had our first child 3 weeks ago on top of my career change so that’s something extra to stress over. As soon as the work day is over it’s my turn to take care of the baby. She’s a great girl and I love my wife so much, but it’s a lot to balance. 

Money is getting pretty tight so we’re talking about selling our house that we have only owned for 8 months so we can downgrade to a cheaper home. So there’s that. 

On top of this my grandfather is in the hospital and has come close to death several times over the last few weeks. Along with my wife and child, he is my favorite person in this world. The amount of love I have for my grandfather is unreal. I visit him multiple times a week and he spends a lot of the time hallucinating and saying some things that don’t make any sense. He’s heavily medicated for pain but if they medicate him any less he will be screaming in pain so what do you do… 

I’ve cried every single day for at least the last 10 days. I’ve been in therapy for a few years so I have that to fall back on but it only helps so much. I meditate every morning and it works a little bit. Meditation and breathing exercises are probably the only thing keeping me from puking every morning before work. My parents try to be understanding and helpful but they can’t give me everything I need. I appreciate their effort but it falls short a lot of times… but I know I shouldn’t rely on others to fix all my problems. 

Anyways, I just wanted to ramble and put things out there and see if anyone wanted to say anything in support or tell me to quit being a baby. Thanks!"
115,Anxiety,"anyone else love being scared, despite a heightened startle reflex?","more of a light-hearted post, and i’m genuinely just curious. but i’m sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed! 

so i have generalized anxiety disorder, ocd, and adhd. i have the most sensitive startle reflex (like i’ll be facing a wall and someone will start speaking from behind me and i’ll jump). 

but i LOVE being scared! i have attended universal halloween horror nights for the past 6 or 7 years and while yes, sometimes it does make me feel like i’m going to pass out and i can feel my heartbeat in my throat, i go back every year! i’ve been so scared in those mazes that i’ve screamed so hard my stomach hurts and i’ve fallen on the floor and run into walls. the only way my startle reflex is dampened is if i have a little alcohol in my system lol. 

i unintentionally scream during jumpscares in horror movies (i really try not to because i know it can get annoying). but horror is still one of my favorite genres!! 

everyone who knows me knows i have a heightened/exaggerated startle reflex (i’m assuming this can be attributed to my anxiety), and they always wonder why i still love horror. and i honestly cannot answer that question. 

but i’m wondering if anyone else is like this?? curious to know how common this is!"

118,Anxiety,Acupuncture for anxiety,"Hi everyone. I'm two months into my anxiety journey, which started very suddenly the day I graduated from driving school. Before going on medication to reduce my psychosomatic symptoms (headaches, dizziness, neck/shoulder tightness and fatigue, acid reflux, IBS) so that I could get back to life while doing CBT therapy, I decided to try seeing if I could handle things holistically first.

On top of exercising regularly, journaling, and meditation, I have just started acupuncture. Placebo effect and all that, but I thought I'd give it a couple of tries anyway. I'll be updating this post with my results since I've tried looking for details from other people and couldn't really find anything.

If anyone wants to write about their own experiences, that'd be amazing.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1st session (9/21) - Felt very sleepy afterwards. Next couple of days, I noticed that I was less jittery and that even though I was still waking up in the night, it felt like I was getting better sleep. I could notice when my muscles were tense and relax them, which I had a very hard time doing before.

2nd session (9/24) - Felt very sleepy afterwards, but then suddenly felt a rush of nervous energy that went away after a few hours. Next day, had a somewhat regular bowel movement (the first time in ages!). Muscles still less tense, still felt less jittery. One interesting thing is I felt very emotional - was listening to a podcast and just started crying. Strangely enough, it felt like I was just able to process how I felt about driving school, which was a huge stressor at the time."
119,Anxiety,"Anxiety from the thought of becoming ""crazy""?","Not sure if I'm the only one, but I am extremely sensitive to the thought of becoming a crazy person, or losing my mind, or anything like that. 
If I see a movie or show about a crazy person, it genuinely makes me anxious. 

Ironically, I work in a mental hospital. Luckily I rarely have time to get anxiety at work because well, I'm working. 

But I just watched the Jeff Dahmer thing on Netflix, and the thought of being crazy like he was really freaks me out.

Can anyone relate? 

(Ps. I have stopped doing any drugs/ hallucinogenics that I would sometimes do at parties or raves, and Im seriously considering to stop drinking alcohol because of the effects it can have over time to the brain. I think I first started getting this type of anxiety trigger after i had a very bad trip experience. I'm 23M btw.)"
120,Anxiety,anxiety and blood tests,"Whenever I get my blood tested, there's always a big rush of adrenaline going through me and I sometimes even tend to get a panic attack whenever the doctor is getting ready to take blood; although I really know that deep down I'm just fine. It's honestly so annoying because as mentioned earlier, I know that I'm just fine but my body's reaction is to immediately panic



Does anyone experience the same, and what things help you to stay calm? I'm getting my blood tested again soon and my mind is already freaking out about it."
121,Anxiety,Weight Loss,Ive seen anxiety tends to cause people to lose weight. But a lot of the reasons i see is because people feel too nauseous all the time to even think about eating. I dont feel nauseous that much. I eat. Idk if im eating enough tho. Im noticing my legs and arms look skinnier (pants that fit tightly are very loose on my legs now). And just holding my phone up above me for a short amount of time tires my arms out quite a bit (when i lie down i rest my phone on my chest but my wrists get really tired from texting). My legs are starting to feel weaker too. Should i be worried?

More so, when you think back to a confrontation or a dumb mistake and wish you could change things. 

In general, how do you move past something that has already happened and you can’t change anything about it?

I find myself going into a complete spiral about some things from the past and I’ll get really anxious and I’ll make myself upset all over again. 

I feel like it’s a waste of time since I can’t change anything about the past and I get hung up on it late at night and worry.

126,Anxiety,"Had my first panic attack in college. Someone managed to see through me i guess, which scared me more than anything. It’s almost my worst nightmare in a way.","
I was hanging out with a friend, he was in my orientation group, we have a few similar classes and overall i’d consider us friends. 

We were studying together. But mostly goofing off. Long story short, he said something. He said “yeah well i wouldn’t be surprised, the closet would be glass with you in it.” 

Then it just hit me. I’m closeted. It almost brings me comfort. No one on my campus knows, i’ve been with someone off campus at a neighboring school, but no one should know. It’s something I wanted to ignore.

I felt everything get super tense and he could tell something was wrong. But i just left muttering a goodbye. He texted me but i was already trying not to freak out on my way to my dorm.

 I’ve never had one so sudden or such a quick reaction. I feel fucking horrible. Now he most definitely knows, or assumes the worst. I don’t want him to hate me. I don’t like feeling like this, i haven’t had a reaction like this for awhile .

I wish i could be stable for once but i’m just so lost."
127,Anxiety,Anybody deal with benzo withdrawal?,"I've been taking Klonopin for years now. I've been prone to anxiety my whole life. I remember first taking a benzo after college and recall feeling so relaxed. Fast forward to right now. I've been on Klonopin for years and am going through the worst feelings.

What's interesting is that I basically go through withdrawal every 2 weeks. I'm only prescribed 2 weeks at a time because I don't trust myself. I have an awful relationship with the drug. It's the only thing that makes me feel calm and normal.

I take an extra here and there resulting in finishing my prescription days early. This particular go round has been extremely difficult. I haven't eaten in 2 days. My head has been pounding since the last time I've taken several pills. My stomach has been a wreck. Zero appetite.

I've been laying in bed all day. I have been experiencing most of the major symptoms and it's scary and extremely uncomfortable. I'm not even sure what to do anymore. I feel like I could seize up at any moment. 

I needed a space to vent but also curious if others deal with benzo withdrawal. Does anybody have any tips to make this shit slightly more bearable. I would never hurt myself but I don't want to feel like this anymore."

I just feel like I was uncomfortable to be around and either of them didn’t like that I came up to them.

130,Anxiety,Anybody else heart beat faster when full,
131,Anxiety,Is this a panic attack or heart problem?,"English is not my first language.
I had my first anxiety attack after smoking weed when i was really stressed. Had a strong body buzz and out of blue i got super scared that i couldn't feel my heart very well due to body buzz and thought my heart was gonna just stop like that.
Since then i've been having an anxiety about cardiac problem.
I have no underlying condition btw (AFAIK)

It started with very low energy/tired feeling all of sudden after i had too much caffeine than i handle. It's like something was draining my energy or my blood.
A bit later, i felt like my heart rate was really slow and beating super lightly like i could barely feel my heart.
I call this the calm before the storm..

Then this 'my heart could just stop any minute now' anxiety kicked in. I felt like i was gonna faint out so i tried to breathe in as much as i could so that it kept me awake.
I wasn't really thinking that it's gonna give me hyperventilation lol
then of course, i had hyperventilation 
feeling super dizzy and tinnitus.
And this weirdest thing happened. It's hard to describe.
Let's say the normal heart beat is like boom, boom like two beats are one set.
But my heart was like boom, boom, thump. its like there was an unexpected extra beat. It lasted at least 10 min.
This was 5 months ago and didn't happen again until yesterday.

There's like caffeine limit i can take so it doesn't happen when i drink only one cup of coffee or not so strong coffee.
But yesterday i wanted to try out new coffee shop. i had a small coffee which was too strong for me on empty stomach also which was a bad idea obviously
and it happened again.
The same the 'the calm before the storm' feeling, same fainting out soon enough feeling, tinnitus, dizziness.
But this time i was trying to breathe not too much and not too fast but regularly like meditating.
I didn't get hyperventilation this time but had this weird three heart beating thing again.

I think this unexpected extra heart beating is Arrhythmia(not sure tho) and i have experienced this when i was super stressed too but it lasted only few seconds.
But what's all these energy draining, dizzy, gonna faint out feelings?

I'm not sure all of these are symptoms of an actual heart problem i didnt know i have or
too much caffeine induced anxiety and ended up having panic attack which led into high stress level then my high stress level caused this heart thing.

My anxiety is always about too slow heart rate and my heart is gonna just stop.
Never had a problem like racing too fast or feeling like heart gonna come out of my chest thing tho"

I had someone request a late check in for himself and his three friends. He said that a host has last minute cancelled on them so I felt sorry and said ok, you guys can come after 10 pm. The guy who booked then said that his phone is about to die and that one of his friends will text me when they will arrive so a few minutes later I receives a message from this friend ""I will arrive around 11 pm"". I was suspicious that he said ""I"" and not we. But I thought all is going to be ok. Then I kind of had the feeling that it is not going to be a group which will arrive but only one guy and my gut feeling was right. When this guy appeared, the friend from the guest who booked I was texting with, he was all on his own and without the guy who booked and without the friends. He said he dropped off the guest who booked and the other friends in town because they wanted to get food and they did not want to keep me up so late so he already went to the house first. 

I did not let him inside because the guy who booked and with whom I first texted with on AirBnB did not appear and only the friend I texted after with via SMS appeared claiming the other ones were getting food. 

Guys, I felt anxious as hell, almost like I had some sort of PTSD and I have no idea if this was my anxiety or if I am starting to become paranoid???? I am a woman living on my own and I was SOO afraid. The guy then left. 

I am not sure if this was all a misunderstanding or if my anxiety kicked in because this was valid?? I am such an anxious person and it destroys my life."

145,Anxiety,Has anyone here completely “eliminated” their anxiety ?,"Hi everyone, first time poster for anxiety. Hope this is appropriate for this thread. 

I’ve had anxiety my whole life. Definitely stems from my family from a young age (at least early teens). I’ve had some terrible “absolute rock bottom” feeling completely out of control moments with panic attacks I couldn’t manage in my 20s. Now in my early 30s, I feel I’ve had a big improvement since then. Been maybe 3 years now that I feel I am actually “in control” and can get through panic attacks (they’re not often anymore) and think logically telling myself that it’s temporary and it’ll pass. And it does!

I’ve accepted that I’ll probably have to live with my anxiety and just have to get through certain moments. I can identify (mostly on my own) when I’m being irrational and reacting purely emotionally, but this also means that I let myself feel my emotions so I’m more in tune with what is triggered by anxiety and not. I definitely still have those “anxiety”’moments and I do my best to handle it and try my best not to let it affect my partner. 

I can give a little example of when my anxiety surfaces. I was prepping for a 3 week trip and 2 days before, my 10 yr old cat was showing symptoms of feeling unwell and although I was able to eventually make a final decision of how I should handle it, my anxiety caused me to have shakey hands and hyperventilate a little, and I was panicking to find a vet asap. It was very difficult to think clearly in that moment, but I was not hysterical. Essentially, I was thinking about the worst, that I’d have to bring her in for emergency surgery and then leave her to be taken care of by my cat sitter and it broke my heart to think about leaving her like that. Eventually, I determined that the situation wasn’t an “immediate emergency”, and everything turned out fine (got a vet the next day and she got meds). 

Like I said, I’ve accepted that I will probably live with this anxiety and I feel it is at its minimum now, but still present. As long as it doesn’t get worse, I’m fine with this. But my partner seems to think that I can get over it completely. As in, I can be in full control of my emotions and catch my anxiety before I even start to feel it. I’m wondering if this is possible? My progress is thanks to self help and constantly trying to be self aware. I’ve had zero therapy and I’ve always been under the impression that therapy helps you cope, not eliminate anxiety. Am I wrong? Is there anyone who has successfully completely gotten over their anxiety?

Please keep in mind, I’m not talking about PTSD. I wouldn’t say I have PTSD. My childhood is in no way “traumatic”, but my home situation was definitely difficult, living with paranoid religious Protestant parents, with little freedom until I was around 21 yrs old. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells living with my family. 

Thanks so much in advance for your advice!"

149,Anxiety,Anxiety attack lasting days,"Hello,

I feel like I've hit rock bottom this time. I've been having panic attacks for years, but last year, after months in therapy and support from family and friends I had gotten a lot better. I managed to go one year without taking Xanax, and life was (mostly) good.


In the past few months, however, life's gone to shit. I've started getting panic attacks again, and more and more frequently. Two days ago, my boyfriend had to go away for work, and that evening I got one of my worst panic attack ever. It lasted 6 hours, and I used all the tools I've learned during all these years but nothing helped. I was just stuck there, suffering alone in my own home. I ended up falling asleep from exhaustion. Since that day, my anxiety has **not** lowered at all. I don't get any break, I'm on the brink of a panic attack all day long. And the evenings are the worst; I just want to go to sleep, but the second I lay down in my bed the panic arrives. I wake up multiple times during the night, and I feel the only thing that'd help me would be rest, but I can't manage to rest correctly.
I've been barely eating and drinking, and I can't go twenty minutes without crying.


I know I'm not the only one who's gone through something like this. It's horrible, but I know I'm going to get better. Do yall have any tips on how to get better, even if it's baby steps?

Thank you for your help"
150,Anxiety,"My boyfriend can't handle my anxiety, should we break up?"," I (21F) have been together with my boyfriend (22M) for about 9 months. I have really bad anxiety, which I take medication for. Honestly it is usually quite manageable, with the right environment and the right support. Sometimes, however, I go into a depressive/anxious episode/period where it is less manageable. When these happen, my boyfriend has a tendency of freaking out and distancing himself, which in turn just feeds my anxiety because it makes me feel like an unlovable freak. This causes the entire thing to turn into a me vs him thing instead of us vs my anxiety. When he's scared of my anxiety he says some pretty hurtful things, things that just make me feel like I'm nothing. He says he doesn't feel like he should have to handle my anxiety and that I just have endless needs. We are a long distance couple which makes this 10x harder. He went back home a week ago, which made things stressful which in turn triggered my anxiety as we hadn't learned to get used to being online again yet. So this whole thing turned into a big argument where I was basically just left to pick myself up on my own as he needed to distance himself to recover. I understand this is really stressful for him, but I cannot handle feeling like a freak in his eyes. I know he loves me so much, and I really love him but I just don't know what to do"

But during the two weeks I was there I had no anxiety. Wake up. Eat breakfast. Go about the day. I never felt any anxiety the whole time.

But then when I got back, it hit me. Not like a ton of bricks, but I started feeling anxiety after the first trigger. I'm under treatment, and I can function, but it was just a weird thing that I didn't feel anything for two weeks."
154,Anxiety,I think I'm emotionally dependent on my friends and I need advice (Long),"I apologize in advance if this gets kinda dramatic, I'm not trying to be, I promise, this is mostly a stream of consciousness explanation. I'll put a TL;DR at the bottom.  
I spend a lot of time with my friends, like, we hang out online in a voice chat and play games pretty much every night, and have been doing so for a while now. 

If they can't make it on one night or have to get off early, I get extremely anxious, even a little bit angry sometimes. It's not that I don't understand that they have their own lives, I totally get that, and the last thing I want is to get so anxious or upset that I demand that they hang out, because I know I wouldn't like it if someone did that to me.

They have lives too, and I understand that, so I need to figure out how to be okay when they can't hang out, and eventually when we all have families or other obligations that put a stop to our nightly hangouts. It's weird because I wasn't like this until recently. 

Late last year, I lost a fairly long standing group of friends for various reasons, and begun hanging out with this ""new"" group, comprised of mostly people I had known well in the past, and was already fairly close to. The loss of the old friend group messed me up pretty bad, but for a while I felt great with the current group, better than I had in a long time with the old group.

Before we started pretty regularly hanging out online every night, I was pretty much fine with being alone or just doing things by myself. I don't know exactly when it changed, but one night when one of them said they couldn't get on the next day I noticed that it filled me with deep sense of dread. It felt like abandonment, I guess, even though I knew that wasn't what was happening. 

A particularly bad trigger is when one of the friends who would always stay up late and hang out until the wee hours of the morning started having to go to bed at a more reasonable time, and hasn't stayed on or hung out late at all since, even on weekends. It's perfectly reasonable to not want to be awake at night until 2 or 3AM, but it still feels almost like I'm being abandoned. Even though they still hang out with me regularly, the sudden change feels like they're just trying to cut down how often they hang out with me. When we had days off, we would both hang out online during the day, and then again that night with the whole group, now that's a thing of the past entirely. I feel like my best friends are starting to hate me, and I don't know how to stop the spiral of negative thoughts. They just keep going until I fall asleep or distract myself from it with something else, but it always comes back when I stop either of those things.

I spent almost my entire life thus far being a people pleaser to avoid being abandoned by loved ones, because I spent a lot of time as a kid around relatives who made me feel that I would be if I ever made a mistake or remotely upset someone. I'm even in therapy right now trying to work through it all, but I don't get to have sessions with my therapist nearly as often as I would like to, and the time between sessions feels like forever. 

I know that this is a lot, and I know it's pretty strange to have a group of friends that hangs out this often, but any advice or ideas on how to stop being so dependent on them would be appreciated. I can't live my life like this, I need to learn to be okay by myself, but all the advice on the internet is just ""do things alone,"" ""treat yourself,"" ""learn to love yourself,"" yeah but HOW? I don't know how to do any of those things without feeling weird or even how to do some of them in the first place.  


TL;DR: I depend on my friends being regularly available for my emotional well being, I want to stop this.  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
155,Anxiety,Does focused art therapy help solving for anxiety?,"A friend of mine recently mentioned how her therapist would ask her to paint or sketch her feelings or identified causes of anxiety. It went somewhat like this - give it a form, give it a colour, etc.
Does anyone over here know how it works out and what are the outcomes of one such exercise?"
156,Anxiety,"I'm worried about the anesthesia not numbing my tooth again. I've been poked prodded, prodded and traumatized twice, and the tooth is still there. I need comfort, and some advice","Hello! To provide some context, I had gone back to the dentist twice to have a decayed tooth (third molar) pulled out without much success, mostly because the anesthetic didn't numb me enough and I could feel every tug at my tooth. Now, if the pain had been bearable I simply would've sat through it, but I have a history of dental trauma and the pain...is so real.  
Now, I have a pretty compassionate dentist. My last tooth extraction was a wisdom tooth (the one next to my third molar) and it took me four visits to finally it pulled, and it hurt everytime. I feel like a fool on the dental chair - I'm sure my dentist hates me at this point. I really try to sit through the pain, but the pain is enough to send me spiraling and having a panic attack. I've cried during 8/10 of my dental visits and I'm embarrassed. I'm 21.  
To make things worse, I'm worried about the safety of this. Now, I had finished a course of antibiotics before my last visit. It's just...I'm scared to go back now because it might fail again. Honestly, on my third visit I'm thinking of just sitting through the pain and telling my dentist to keep tugging through the tears. I like my dentist - she's my mom's best friend and she's never been annoyed at me or anything. I just can't help but feel violated, even if she didn't do it on purpose.  
What can I do to distract myself from the pain next time? I'm so scared to go back. Dental visits used to be really chill back then."
157,Anxiety,"Anxiety is gone, but somehow i still feel there are minor symptoms","5 months ago my anxiety was worse due to binge drinking, i stopped drinking and smoking but switched to vaping instead. Somehow, some days in a week when night is coming or sometimes in the afternoon, i can't think straight, this happens everyday but sometimes not. Is it still an effect of anxiety? I was rushed to the ER because my hands twisted and my body and face went numb, other doctors thought it was a seizure but i was fully awake at that time and my body went cold and can feel it rising to my head during that time. I always get the sense of dread and fear every afternoon exactly 5PM onwards for some minutes or hours. I've practiced calming my anxiety naturally and stopped the meds and did work but there are intrusive thoughts and all i do in a day is sit in the computer because of online classes. Is it something else related to anxiety? My thinking speed was always fast but somehow it has reduced ever since i healed from anxiety. Im always a curious person when i drink but ever since i stopped drinking those curious thoughts became intrusive thoughts which went natural now in my lifestyle. I try not to think about much whenever i get simple symptoms such as back fatigue and other stuff but when those stuff are gone, thoughts of fear and dread come in and i always have in my mind ""Im gonna hyperventilate and hope it does not occur like last 5 months ago'' What are the chances of hyperventilating again? I try to get some exercise but i get shy because my exercising spot which is in my terrace is in front of alot of neighbor's house which they can see me which i get shy with. Anyways what were some symptoms that commonly show up after anxiety went away, im always thinking that i have depression and need to overcome this again. Thanks for those who comments!"

After noticing it’s late my stomach has been hurting for so long now. Just now, I felt like vomiting. My anxiety makes me have stomach pain and nausea but everything is a pregnancy sign. I’m super scared on if I’m imagining it or it’s actually happening.

I’m scared if it’s some impossible thing that made me pregnant then I’ll have like powers or something, or maybe be hunted down. Any girls have this problem? Like missing periods and feeling sick? I‘m having a panic attack."

I have had some decent interview experiences but the last one was so awful. The interviewers were so uninterested and made it so clear that my answers weren't good enough. It was so bad I  considered leaving halfway through. 

Since that interview, I have canceled 3 interviews because I couldn't cope with the thought of them, especially because they were panel interviews. 

But tomorrow I finally have an interview with just one person and I think it's a good place to try get over my last bad experience especially because I am kinda under qualified for it (idek why I got an interview). 

But I'm so scared I'm just gonna freak out and cancel it again :("
168,Anxiety,Bullshit around spiritual awakening,"Spiritual awakening? No matter how much I talk to these people they say I can’t simply understand. They say the just had a moment one day and were granted eternal happiness. And that they are aware for the first time? It goes against all logic, science, physics and laws of nature. What’s behind it, are they brainwashed or just delusional? Does it have to do something with brain chemicals like dopamine? Like what exactly happened in the brain? Therapy and meds seem useless if something can cure all your problems in a moment and grant you eternal happiness. Having anxiety this rather scares me, it feels like I am getting brainwashed myself. I want to stay sane and not become some kind of monk that tells everyone that that the world is a made up concept in your mind and only one consciousness exists. I would rather die than be this disconnected from reality. Wtf is up with these people?"

On the bright side of things I can get therapy which I could never do where I currently am. I'm looking forward to that because I feel like a mess.

I quit soccer and running, and now i do jiu jitsu and often go to the gym. There was a time that i began to panic in the middle of the night because my chest hurt and it was like a squeezing feeling. I went to the hospital and they checked my blood and did an EKG. Everything was normal and they sent me back home. I went to the doctor the next week and he said that it might be a panic attack and i might have anxiety. I refuse to believe it is anxiety because it feels so real. It's so hard to live with it because when i go for a run i feel pressure in the middle of my chest, i feel that my heart sometimes skips a beat and i immediately stop with running thinking i will get a heart attack. I already had a holter, i wore it for like 3 days and they also checked the veins around my heart, they said there is nothing wrong and you dont have to worry and that everything is going to be okay. It is anoying because everytime i work out now and do high intensity training, i get this chest tightness and my heart that is skipping beats, even when i'm not thinking of ""what is going on with my heart"". Does anyone with anxiety has the same feeling as me, even when working out and not thinking about it, like when you're just in the couch doing nothing and watch television? I would like to know your experience. Sorry for my english grammar, i'm from Belgium."
175,Anxiety,Anxiety is preventing me from getting help for my anxiety,"tl;dr: the process of getting help for my mental health worsens my anxiety. Counselling previously has heightened the symptoms of my mental health struggles. How do I make a break through and get help? Has anyone experienced this before?

So for a bit of a backstory:
I was in counselling but we couldn't get anywhere because I was too heightened. I thought it would pass and it was just the extra stress of starting to attend, but then months went by whilst I never got more comfortable nor did it get any easier to go. 

I wasn't even attending for an anxiety related problem but we couldn't focus on the other stuff properly because I was too anxious during every session. Just the process of going in for the session and having to essentially trust a stranger was too much.

My counsellor mentioned that people are usually happy to come in and they want to talk to her, whilst I was fighting tooth and nail to be there. I thought it was normal for it to be very difficult to go?

I tried to explain to her that this wasn't what I was trying to focus on, and I felt like how I was during sessions wasn't an accurate depiction of my day to day life. I was still able to get what I needed to out, talking about my reason for being there, but she said we wouldn't be able to make progress without tackling my anxiety first anyway and that the anxiety itself was a problem that needed to be addressed whether i acknowledged it or not. 

I was anticipating I would struggle, but not like this. Nothing I envisioned was even comparative to how difficult it actually was.

My counsellor then wanted to refer me out for diagnosis and I essentially ended up ghosting her during the referral process because it was too much. I haven't been back since.

The problem is, now i'm thinking I might need to go back and try counselling or therapy again because I'm not able to make progress independently. Everything is feeling cyclical and I know I don't have the tools to help myself. But I don't know how I'm going to be able to return and make it work. I've had 3 counsellors previously and haven't made progress with any of them.

I understand that maybe she wasn't a good fit for me and I might feel more comfortable with someone else? It just seems impossible to imagine making progress. 

Does anyone have experience with this or something similar?

180,Anxiety,Anxiety Attack Advice (my 2nd one),"TLDR - My 2nd maybe 3rd anxiety attack ever (years appart) and I don't know how to manage them - Tips/advice welcome

&amp;#x200B;

I have just had my second anxiety attack just before. The last one was maybe 3-4 years ago, so I cant say Im very experienced in how to best manage them  


I'm not sure whats set them off (although Ill include my best guess below), but it's quite overwhelming, I wouldn't describe myself as typically anxious if Im honest

&amp;#x200B;

but the first one I experienced, my mental health wasn't in the best place and I had been struggling, I then broke up with a girl (indirectly as a result of this, I wasn't in a good headspace, and that influenced a lot of how I acted). Straight after it ended and she left I felt I'd lost all control, the last thing that I was holding onto for any stability was gone and I had a full on panic attack

&amp;#x200B;

I've just had my second there, I would say my mental state is actually quite good atm (better than its been for a long time - actually good). But I had a fwb I met recently come to stay for the weekend, we are both extremely clear on this being more of a casual thing, and longterm it wouldn't work, both have completely different life goals, lifestyles, etc. It flat out wouldn't function.,.. also geographically, she leaves for Canada in 2 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway we had spent the weekend together, and I have never felt more comfortable around another person and being completely myself. We had had sex a few times, gone out for drinks and food over the weekend. When she left earlier, I felt quite anxious but I thought well Ive had a few drinks the last few days (not normal for me), and not great sleep. Its probably a bit of that

&amp;#x200B;

I went to the gym, and on the bus back it was building and building and I started tearing up out of nowhere. Im very sad she had to leave today and even more so she's leaving the country and I may only see her 1 maybe 2 more times. When I got home in the shower I pretty much just started bawling tears and not hyperventilating but I was having an attack

&amp;#x200B;

Note\* I have been to therapy before and one of the topics we spoke about was maybe a slight fear of abandonment or people not liking me for whatever reason that may be. Besides the point

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I think situations like this where I maybe open up to people more than normal and then they have to leave for whatever reason are massively triggering for me. And I'll be honest I really don't know how to cope with anxiety attacks and be ok. Like Im struggling right now.

&amp;#x200B;

Could anyone with similar experiences or just general advice please let me know, so I can best manage this in the future"

184,Anxiety,Do you meditate?,"I’ve recently tried meditation as a way to help with my anxiety which I previously thought was only a mental and emotional problem. It’s reminding me of how the mind is part of the body which, to me, means two things: a lot of bodily tension can cause unpleasant symptoms in the mind, and changing the body can be an inroad to changing the mind.

However, to me, meditation is still considerably doubted. Does meditation help anyone else, or do you find it to be a waste of time? If it does help you, do you have any advice for someone just starting to meditate?"

I was abused as a child and never good enough and had to constantly get 100% at school and when I got 100%, my dad would ask me why I didn’t get 110% (no bonus questions, that’s why!) It was never enough. We couldn’t have the school send report cards home because if I had a B (and 15 As, mind you), the B would get me abused. I had to be perfect.

And I think a lot of this is playing out in my work life now. If I’m not perfect at something or a client is mad over something, I spin out and get filled with anxiety.

A week ago I was in a coffin elevator and felt *panic* for the first time in my life.,"I get it now. I understand what someone means when they start describing what a panic attack is. My empathy for anxiety disorders has gone through the roof. This absolute, primal terror that insanity and/or death is coming to take your consciousness. It literally felt like insanity was crawling into my body and brain. I cant imagine having to deal with constant anxiety coupled with the ever present reality that it could descend into a panic attack whenever it wants.

199,Anxiety,I feel so anxious after social interactions even though I enjoy them at the time,"As I wake up a bit hung over, I am becoming even more acutely aware that my anxiety is becoming worse and worse.

I thought my anxiety was just because of my grad school program or the licensure exam or whatever stressor was happening next and it was normal.

But now my life’s settled, that’s over.... and literally everything I do makes me feel SUPER anxious. But especially any social cue. I get anxious and fixate on small innocuous comments from my bosses or coworkers and start convincing myself they hate me or I’m gonna get fired. Apparently now I can’t even hang out with or chat with friends.

I feel like I am such a weirdo and nobody likes me and I probably made everyone uncomfortable last night. There are no justifications for these thoughts, they’re not based in reality. And I have had them after every social interaction with anyone I know recently. 

It doesn’t help that we were celebrating my birthday and new job so I got super drunk and don’t remember like whole pieces of the night. I’m worried I did something really wrong socially.

Haven't had a completely normal day since. I will have good days &amp; horrible days, but even on my good days I will experience mild anxiety. I just want it to stop. I want to enjoy my life without fear. I want to accept that I will die one day &amp; that's ok or that yes a medical episode could happen but it's out of my control &amp; I don't need to worry about it- but I really just can't. I can't force myself to stop worrying about it. I've been told I'm okay a million times but it's just not enough but I wish it was."
202,Anxiety,Vent: I feel like I am losing progress with my anxiety and I feel bad,"TW: sh

I feel like I am losing progress with my anxiety and I am slipping back into old habits and it sucks. I know progress isn't linear and it's expected but it still doesn't feel good. 

This week my fiancé flew down from Utah (I live in Texas) and even though I was happy and excited, the change of having them here still was causing my stress levels to be a little elevated. At one point I was training my SDiT and he wasn't wanting to listen to commands and my fiancé was watching and I was getting really anxious because of it and &gt;!I started to panic and I freaked out and I ended up biting my hand really hard!&lt;. About two days later my fiancé and I had an argument because of communication problems and because we were both stressed out (me because of work and sensory issues and heightened anxiety and them because of their schedule changing and feeling out of place in our house) and I went to my room and&gt;! had a panic attack and ended up biting myself two more times!&lt;. I went three more days being able to manage my anxiety pretty well but yesterday we were at Walmart and we were about to leave and this guy came up to us and started honking and telling me to roll down my window just to say he could fix the dent in my car and he left when I said no, and then I &gt;!had a panic attack in the parking lot for about twenty minutes and ended up scratching my hands without noticing I was doing it and now I have blisters on the back of both of them and it hurts to move and do anything with them.!&lt;

I just feel really bad and about this because I had a good streak going but now anytime something happens, no matter how small, I just want to start falling back into one of those habits again and it just sucks"
203,Anxiety,Anxiety over double vision that may or may not even be there?,"I have a lot of health anxiety surrounding my head. I have had migraines for a long time that have evolved to more vestibular migraines and my anxiety always revolves around them. 

Lately I’ve been having regular dull headaches and blurry vision and now I’ve convinced myself I have double vision, too. But the thing is, I don’t think I even do? It’s not there are two separate images, it’s just that they’re blurry but my brain is totally convinced that I’m seeing two of everything and it’s so weird. 

I am so scared of a tumor even though I’ve had a clean MRI and CT about a year ago. Has anyone ever experienced anything similar?"
204,Anxiety,Whats the outlook of people that have life long anxiety?," 

23 male, 6ft 142 lbs.

I know I've been anxious like all my life but its just a lot more severe now. I know that stress is bad on health so how does life long expectantly or quality of life look for people like me? Im really paranoid about my health and Im trying to work through through anxiety but some days it hits back like a fucking brick.

Like the past 3 days all I did was ignore any anxious thoughts and miraculously most of my day was great and panic free. sure I had like one or 2 adrenaline rushes but overall it was a massive improvement. Today however I had a panic attack in the shower and my heart rates been at like 100 all day cuz thats the only thing I can think about.

When I was younger I had anxiety here and there but it was much shorter lasting because being a kid it was a lot easier to let go of things and move onto something more distracting. Now if I have a symptom rather than moving on I cant help but to focus on it and brood over it all day.

Can people live long healthy lives even with an anxious personality? As long as its like not out of control?"
205,Anxiety,I started a new job and I’m struggling with my anxiety,"I was recently let go from a toxic internship where my boss was not very nice and I struggled with stomach issues from anxiety. I’d message people asking if my boss was there, out of hope that they wouldn’t be. (Yea it was bad).

Now I’m back in the mind zone where I’m scared I’ll be fired again and usually for ridiculous things. It also doesn’t help, that where I sit at my work, is near the directors office. Let’s just say he talks very loud, and I can hear everything. By everything, I hear people getting fired, money getting lost, people getting in trouble. Basically it makes me feel very uncomfortable and not really wanting to work there. 

I’ve also developed this fear that I am going to get fired because there’s a language barrier between my boss and I. Basically what I’ve realized is that the language barrier comes into play when my boss is explaining difficult technical tasks to me. What I’ve also realized is that when they describe the task to me it’s usually way more complicated sounding than it actually is when you figure it out. My fear is that I’m going to get fired because my boss thinks I’m stupid because I have to repeatedly go to them and ask them to explain a specific task over and over again because they didn’t explain it correctly or well or whatever. 

I just really hate living in the state of constant fear of something. sometimes it feels like I am so used to being in a fearful state, that I’ve become comfortable with having some kind of fear in my life.

I started going back to therapy this past late spring. The only issue is that my therapist is kind of weird in the sense that we spend the bulk of the time with her kind of going off tangents talking about her life and her stories regarding her life that someone sort of relate to my issues. I feel like my problems with having ADD and anxiety or not really tackled because we talk about things like her cats and car accidents that she’s gotten into. 

Wondering if anyone has dealt with anything similar. Excuse my ranting."
206,Anxiety,Anxiety is…,"Anxiety is
The first time you surface when you fall into deep water not knowing how to swim.
Hearing the voice of a family member saying your name after you answer a call at 3am.
It is the moment right before you choose flight or fight, so you’re planning both.
Your thoughts directly after you hear a surprise explosion or feel the ground move.
It is the lump in your throat before breaking down in tears. 
Anxiety is the inhale right before a scream.
Those of us who suffer this exhausting condition, it is all of the above and more.
However, there is one thing anxiety means to us that others cannot understand.
Anxiety is always. It doesn’t stop. Ever.
It’s just always."
207,Anxiety,What helps you?,"Starting a thread of people sharing what helps them with anxiety, maybe sharing stories can help one another!

Last year was the hardest year of my life, but I made it and so can you! I want to thank this page and people who comment to know we aren’t alone!(: 

The gym saved me, gained weight from my crippling anxiety and learning to love my body and that it’s okay but one day at a time. Meditation was amazing, I have one of the acupressure mats, I would lay on that while meditating and honestly, swear by that! 

Share what helps you! I’d love to learn more and what I can do to better myself and hopefully help others!
Also, feel free to message me! I know talking to a stranger can be so so helpful🤍"
208,Anxiety,Dry throat,I hope it’s not the c word the left side feels dry
209,Anxiety,[15 M] I can’t stop throwing up.,"Every single morning I have to run to the bathroom and throw up purely because I’m just that anxious. I’m in the 10th grade and the classes I’m taking are more difficult than I thought they would be and it’s eating me up inside. Literally. Just last week I had a presentation and couldn’t get through it because everyone was looking at me and again, I had run out of there half way through to be sick ALL OVER THE HALLWAY. I can’t keep living like this and I desperately need advice when it comes to coping with such extreme anxiety. I’ve lost weight, I’m always pale and my mind is always racing. Any advice? Or will I continue to suffer silently? Fuck."
210,Anxiety,how to get through this,"this is going to sound so trivial and insignificant, but I worked really hard on making dinner. my coworker was over, as well as my good friend and he said ""im sorry, I just can't finish this"" and threw my food in the trash. not because he wasn't hungry or anything, he just thought my food was gross. my friend really liked it though. I know this is going to really bother me for the foreseeable future. please offer advice on how to move on and not ruminate on this dumb situation. my brain loves to ruminate and make myself feel worse about things"
211,Anxiety,Had a series of mental breakdowns over the past few days. I can't seem to feel better or relax enough to de-stress at all. Help?,Basically the title. I literally can't function. I can't go to work or manage to eat or drink without my partner bringing me food. I don't know what to do. My brain and body feels like mush. If I think it's about how much of a piece of shit I am and it makes me cry so I just try to distract myself but my brain feels too shot for that lately. Just don't know what to do.
212,Anxiety,Confused feeling after traumatic event at a concert,I was at a concert with friends and got very dehydrated and smoked weed which caused a panic attack. I don’t 100% know it was a panic attack because I felt oddly calm but I passed out and remember being on the floor and not knowing how I got there. They basically dragged me outside and the emt looked at me and let me sit for a while and then I went back in after about 20 or 30 minutes. This has happend 1 time before but it was never as bad as this. I know from they outside it may not seem so traumatic but I can’t do anything anymore without thinking of it and I just have this feeling of guilt building up and up and I don’t know how to make it better or what to do.
213,Anxiety,I’m nearly 30 and I feel like being an anxious man is unacceptable. How do I let go?,"Not sure if this is a trigger warning as the content is very negative.

I’ve always had a tendency to beat myself up over things the average person wouldn’t be concerned about. Such as my ex leaving me for someone else but giving me mixed signals, or feeling inadequate at work even though no one has told me this. I’ve been single for years and I don’t get many opportunities to socialise due to my job’s working hours and all my friends and family being in relationships or having kids. So I have a much higher amount of free time. I socialise as much as I can given the circumstances and have what people would call interesting hobbies and personality.

The simple answer is ‘work on yourself’ but I fundamentally need to change my brain’s thought patterns and feel like I can’t feel secure without a partner. I’m autistic so this probably compounds the issue and I’ll never be able to process thoughts like a normal person. Can anyone help? I’m too old to have these feelings any more. People expect me to be secure and confident at this age, and I try this as much as possible, but the average 30 year old man is way ahead of me in terms of life experience and emotional support from their partners."
214,Anxiety,How do I deal a with this?!(Panic Attacks),"Almost every single night I get a panic attack. My throat closes up and breathing feels restricted, even right now it's affecting me.  What do I do? It's 12 am. With only my phone to distract myself"
215,Anxiety,"i am fine and nothing is wrong, but…","i have this heavy weight in my chest that i’ve had all day long. my brain will just scan and scan through the day to pinpoint something i did wrong ( no matter how minor) in order to attach this feeling to it. it’s exhausting. my brain wants something to point fingers at as to why i feel this way but nothing is wrong and nothing bad happened today. so i’m stuck with this awful heaviness, almost wanting to cry, feeling."
216,Anxiety,looks like i’m gonna be running a social group of 20+ people today… hellppp,"i love my community and absolutely want to support the club (an lgbt+ social group), but right now we don’t really have any solid plans, and most if not all of the people on the board/running the club can’t be there in person. this is the first meeting of the semester, so it’s also gonna be first impressions for a lot of people. 

i feel i’m awful at talking to people, and i’m scared i’ll mess up somehow in assisting with (if not fully) running the group. we have one or two prompt ideas for a group discussion, but that’s about it… should i have more, like some sort of activity? more prompts? i wouldn’t even know what conversation ideas to use. 

sorry to ramble, just a bit overwhelmed and don’t want people to see me being a mess/ dislike me, and as a result feel the same abt the club. could use some support/ advice if anyone has any"
217,Anxiety,I found the courage to go to a concert but it did not go well,"The long drive there was a lot to deal with. My nerves were on edge from that. But I still felt ok. I thought I did enough work to handle a concert, but I wound up having an anxiety attack,... more than one....and I to sit far away from the seats we had bought. I really wanted to see the show, so despite my panicking, we stayed but not in the seats we bought. It really frustrated the person I was with. As much as I wanted to enjoy it like others do, it was too overwhelming between the noise, crowd, smoke, feeling the bass in my chest. And the person is very patient and understanding, but the frustration comes because as much as one can try to understand, they really don't know what its like. 

I've been handling my anxiety so much better but I just couldn't do it. I don't wish anxiety on anybody. It goes into every part of your life."
218,Anxiety,Very afraid to go to sleep right now,"I have such a horrible feeling that something bad is going to happen but I don’t want to keep thinking about it. Main reasons:

1. I can’t stay up all night again, I’m exhausted.
2. I feel like if I keep thinking about everything bad that can happen it *will* happen because I manifested it
3. I feel stupid for thinking I have such power to do so
4. I feel weak for not having control over things in life even though logically I know that’s impossible


I’m so tired of logically understanding that this is anxiety and intrusive thoughts, but still having the emotional/physical symptoms of anxiety. What is the point of knowing my diagnosis and still feeling everything anxiety tells me is real? It’s like I have two brains."
219,Anxiety,I’m coming to terms with living with anxiety and I’ll be okay.,"I may not be able to live on my own until my mid twenties. I may never be able to have a full time job. I may not function the same as everyone else, but that’s okay. 

I’ve made it this far. I’ve survived. My life may look a bit different, I may have to face different struggles, but that’s okay. I don’t have to be like everyone else. I don’t have to hit the same milestones everyone else does. 

I got my driver’s license, I’m looking after my pets full-time, I make all my own food and do my own laundry, I look after my health and am constantly working on improving myself. 

I went from a shower once a month to multiple times a week. I went from only being able to leave the house once every few months to leaving multiple times a week (even if that’s just for a short drive to the post office). 

Maybe I’m 6-7 years behind in my education. Maybe I still need people to get me groceries and help me clean my house. Maybe I need a little extra help. Maybe I’m not like everyone else. But I’m improving and I’m finding what makes me happy and that is all that matters. 

I’m carving out a bit of joy and comfort in my life through slow, hard work. I’m successful and capable, even if that success and capability isn’t the same as others. 

I do not need to measure my happiness and my success by the standards set by people who do not go through what I do on a daily basis."
220,Anxiety,how do I do something without seeming creepy?,"

I'm on this English speaking camp rn ( I'm polish). And there is a message board. Everyone has an envelope there and you can send notes to a person by putting it in their envelope. 
So. There are two people i want to ask for social media/phone number but don't know if i should.
I dont want them to get the wrong ideas about me and why i ask. (I already send them notes saying they are really cool 
One is someone i admire and want to be like them
The other one is this sweet disabled girl. (Something to do with legs, idk she gotta use does stick to help her walk)
Should I go for it, what do I say, will sending another note make them think I'm obsessed?"
221,Anxiety,"I’ve gone through bouts of really intense anxiety, and also prolonged stretches of an annoying amount of anxiety, but I’ve recently felt better then ever!","Around half a year ago I got a new job. At first I was my usual super cautious self that was too afraid to get involved with jokes and general banter etc. but after a few months, some newer people joined. I was tasked to train them up and show them the ropes and also give them a little kick up the ass if they’re being slack. And through this responsibility, it feels like it’s just SHREDDED through my anxiety. I’m now completely out of my shell at work. This confidence has also transferred to general life as well. 

Confidence really is the best drug.

Honestly, if you’re struggling with anxiety, in your own time, I’d suggest to try and find a way to put yourself out there a little bit. And over time just work your way up to the point where you have built lots of confidence.

It just feels so weird not acting awkward in public, and not being shy to speak loud and clear to someone in front of loads of people. It really feels amazing.

Not sure how helpful this’ll be, but I just thought I’d share my recent developments"
222,Anxiety,Any tips for how to stop biting nails when anxious?,
223,Anxiety,Does anyone else experience this?,"24 female. For the past year or so I’ve noticed that I get extremely upset over little things that I never used to notice. It’s mainly over waste. For example, when someone in my home wastes food, uses an excessive amount of paper towels, or even uses too much hand soap, it feels like it drives me crazy inside. I get angry and then I want to cry. I notice that I am constantly watching others and looking to see if they’re using the amount of the item that I myself would use. This is with everything… letting the water run while brushing teeth, leaving lights on, throwing away leftovers in the fridge. This corresponds over into my eating habits as well, and I feel like I can’t quit eating unless I finish every bite of my food, even when I’m full. I watched a coworker put together a shelf the other day and he lost a washer and couldn’t find it, and just put the bolt on the screw without the washer. This made me so upset inside that I had to walk away. It makes me ashamed that I feel this way about literally everything and I have no idea why. As I’ve never been this way and it’s only started pretty recently. I do struggle with anxiety and have for years but this is like nothing I’ve ever experienced and I can’t take it anymore. Does anyone else struggle with this or something similar?"
224,Anxiety,Do you guys also get frustrated that the world prefers people who are outgoing/outspoken/leaders?,"It's always been a frustration of mine that society usually always prefers those who are outgoing or outspoken or are natural leaders. I mean of course that makes sense. Assertive personalities seem like know what they want and they effect change easily, and people like that. But the frustration more comes from the fact that I am not that, and I don't think I can be that. 

Even in smaller contexts, like in school, for example. In college, everyone knows reciting and participating a lot can get you plus points with the professor, and again it makes sense because you're building rapport with them and initiating discussions. So while most people get to do that, my fear restrains me, and the professor sees me as unresponsive or may not even really know me. 

In group works with many members, I feel too anxious to initiate things or to suggest ideas, but I do everything assigned to me and do a lot of the behind-the-scenes work. But those unfortunately don't get as recognized as others who are outspoken even if their contributions aren't as substantial. 

I don't know, there are just so many disadvantages to having bad social anxiety, and it sucks."
225,Anxiety,What do i do?,"I feel myself getting bad again. My boyfriend moved out after living together for over a year. I see him on the weekends, but he was my biggest help with my anxiety. I felt so safe with him. 
I live away from my parents for college, and I’ve been here for over a year and still haven’t made any friends. I don’t know how to. I feel so lonely and I have no one to talk to. I turn to Reddit threads to maybe have some interactions with people. I miss my mom and my dad and I want to move back home but it’s not an option right now. I’m broke and I’ve been trying to find a job which is just adding on to the stress. I had a job here previously but my anxiety got so bad everytime I would have to go to work, and it was a toxic environment so I left. 
I live with my brother who just goes to work comes home and sleeps. I’m tired of living this same constant loop. I cry at night because I feel so lonely. It’s crazy how I live in such a big city but still haven’t made a friend. I don’t know how much longer I can do this. I can’t move home because I have classes to go to, but I know I would feel much happier back home. I can feel my boyfriend getting more tired of me each day because all I do is cry and I can’t control it. I’m anxious all of the time and I just don’t know what to do. I feel so lonely."
226,Anxiety,Ticks fobia (anxiety),"Hi, so where i live (middle EU) Slovakia are so many ticks for like 8 months of the year. 

I love nature so much, hiking, walks in forest etc,... But sadly I'm able to enjoy them only in around winter time when ticks are 99% not active. As soon as temperature starts to rise up, I'm just avoiding big grass, smaller trees and every bush where could ticks hide. I sadly also almost gave up mushroom picking.

I also spray myself with every anti-ticks sprays that exist but it anyway it doesn't really protect you and they just don't really relief my anxiety.

Whenever i walk into small bush, grass, forest grass or whatever i immediately feel anxious and I'm looking all around my body non-stop if that motherfcker is already climbing up to me.

""Funny thing"" is that I'm actually probably attractive to ticks, because whenever i go with someone to nature I'm the one 90% of the time who at least spots one on my the body and my fiends just doesn't get them as often. *(I also have crohns disease so i hoped somehow they wont like my blood :D)*

It all started in early age when the whole family of like 10people lived in same house, back than i was an only child and everybody care about me so much even until now (23yo.). Once we went to forest i was like 9-10 years old and i got 2 ticks next to my crotch. My heartrate was through the roof and i remember i felt like I was about to pass out from anxiety. Also what kinda traumatized me was everybody was looking at my dick/crotch for like 30minutes as then were pulling it out. I didn't get any shit disease ticks carry (ever in my life).

 Ever since this moment I'm just staying away from grass and bushes and I'm sick of it, even when I'm with my friends and they pass through some grass behind the building or wherever I'm just passing around through safe asphalt.

Also what bothers me and i know it sound fcking crazy but whenever i get home from any nature/grass environment and I potentially carry any ticks i throw all my clothes to my loft as i call it ""tick quarantine"" sometimes (minimum for 4days), then of course I'm showering 30minutes and checking my body for next 15minutes if i having any ticks on my skin. Drives me crazy. 

Also the anxiety is there for other approx.. 2hours and releases it self slowly to zero in 1-2 days.  
Every time something scratches me i fell like i just must check if it isn't tick. I fell like mad man sometimes.

My phobia is not a secret but only family, very close friends and girlfriend knows about it.  
(Please don't recommend therapy but i know it might help)

Can anyone relate or help how to overcome it?"
227,Anxiety,Does anyone else find it ironic how anxiety producing it is to be approved for leave related to anxiety?,"I’m on leave right now from my job and I am waiting to see if I can get approved for short term disability while I try for the tenth time to figure out what meds are actually gonna help so I can function at least somewhat normally. 

I was also told that if my anxiety is because of my job that the leave will be denied. Which just makes me more stressed. Who doesn’t get stress/anxiety from their job? So now I have to make sure my physiatrist and psychologist don’t just mention my job in any paperwork that’s sent or it will get denied. 

I’ve been stressed out and anxious since I was 5. I remember not wanting to leave the house cu thought I would get killed or kidnapped. I remember freaking out every time my mom came home late from work because I was positive that something happened to her. 

And now every time I get an email or call from my case manager I freak out. I’m on medication that is preventing the panic attacks but I’m still getting the freaking anxiety. At least with the panic attacks afterwards I would kinda feel better. 10 minutes of no control and then I would be a little more relaxed. I could deal with that. Now it’s just the feeling leading up to the panic attacks for like an hour. I freaking hate it. 

All the while I’m trying to make sure everyone is turning their paperwork in on time and that everything is moving on like it should be. Last time I called the short term disability lady I was shaking so bad I dropped my phone. I’m not doing good at keeping up with it. 

People with anxiety have a hard time doing normal stuff. Getting approved for leave to try to get better is unnecessarily hard for people with anxiety. 

Trying to help my anxiety *shouldn’t* be anxiety inducing."
228,Anxiety,Is anyone awake? Awful panic attack from being around Coke.,"I’ve been up for like 23 hours almost and finally got home to sleep. My friend came in to give me a high five and I think his hand may have had residual cocaine on it. Idk for sure. I put my finger in my nose and just freaked out. Now wide awake - full blown shaking panic attack and am so tired.

Does anyone know if POSSIBLE residual can get you high or am I just panicking right now. I’m freezing, and shaking with some teeth chatter. FUCKING HATE ANXIETY"

231,Anxiety,i feel 90% better,I start trt
232,Anxiety,I hate this,I go back to college soon and that is sort of where we start. I have terrible social anxiety when I’m in unfamiliar environments and that’s exactly what happened last year I was in an unfamiliar place with unfamiliar people. I didn’t become as close as I would’ve like with the kids there. I bonded more with older kids in my brothers class and house but they all graduated so that sucks but it’s also ok. I’m going to be a junior and I just don’t know what to expect. Everybody there loves me as a person and I love them they are awesome people. But as I grow closer to going it feels more and more like I’ve never been there. I can’t really say why. But the thing that sucks is that I see peoples stories on snap and shit and I’m like wow I can’t wait to go it’s gonna be so fun. And I see all the beautiful girls I wanna talk to (that part was unnecessary but true especially because I feel more confident in my ability to talk to girls now for some reason). I just hate that I have these two opposing mindsets that are controlling me and it sucks because I leave Sunday and time just seems to be going slower the closer it gets because I wanna go more sometimes and then other times I literally have a panic attack thinking of seeing people.
233,Anxiety,Propranolol - When will it stop making me sleepy?,"I’ve been on Propranolol (10mg) for two weeks now for anxiety. First week was amazing, no side effects, anxiety was basically non existent. Second week, the tiredness side effect has kicked it. The word “tired” doesn’t even describe what I’m feeling each day to be honest. It gets to around 2/3PM and I’m struggling to keep my eyes open. 

Anybody know if this is a temporary side effect that will eventually phase out or am I stuck with being this sleepy everyday? 

Would love to hear peoples personal experience on Propranolol too. ☺️"

I couldn't join because I have a job and my vacation days ran out. Why does the thought of him traveling by car makes me feel anxious? I am aware that this is all in my head, but I can't calm down. He's going to stay there for 2 weeks. I just want him back home safe and sound already."
235,Anxiety,should i homeschool this year?,"I heard a lot about homeschooling and i am very interested in it. I would like to go to work, have time for gym and hobbies, so I wonder if I should switch to homeschooling. I also have a lot of anxiety when it comes to school. What do you guys think?"
236,Anxiety,Does anyone have experience with finding a WFH job while dealing with severe anxiety?,"I have panic disorder (diagnosed, four hours of panic attacks a day really sucks) and agoraphobia (undiagnosed, but I get a panic attack when I leave the house. I have to take a Klonopin to even get the mail some days).

It developed rapidly out of nowhere about a year ago, I went to a psych ward, was on Lexapro and Klonopin except I can't afford to see the doctor to renew my Lexapro script so I'm currently weening off of it.

It's been hard, and the lack of income after years of working 60-80hrs a week is hurting me and my relationship.

I just genuinely don't know where to start even finding a WFH entry-level job. I've been working in Kitchens from cook to management, designing menus, etc,. I even worked part time in a family bounce-house business until it was sold, and it's all screwed because of my brain lmao.

I have to start over at almost thirty, and working from home sounds like a godsend. I'm technically inclined but haven't had any certificates since web design in HS, but I know my way around a computer. I'm just paralyzed with even trying to figure out where to turn.

Like, everything looks like a scam, I don't know who is and isn't a legitimate company, I've never even used LinkedIn but I guess I need to set up a profile? I'm so lost and it makes me shut down.

I've been about two months panic attack free so I think I can affectively work as long as I don't need to leave, my ability to cope with stress is a lot lower than it used to be though. I just want a nice eight hours a day, five days a week, minimum wage job. Nothing crazy. I just don't know where to go.

I thought y'all might know a bit to help. Where to look? What to do? What skills are needed?

Thank you!"

239,Anxiety,"sertraline. started taking and feel awful, like I'm worse?","I started taking Sertraline (Zoloft in US) again.

I'm in my 30s and was last prescribed it back in my early 20s for OCD and Anxiety. Unfortunately due to some life events this has come back having been off meds for 10 years.

I remember being quite jittery before and getting restless legs alot but nothing like this. 

I'm only 2 days in and I'm a wreck. My body feels weak and my hands shake and Im not sure if that feeling is high untreated anxiety or the meds.

Anyone else get this? 

Trying to weigh up whether to power through or ask my doctor to go on something else."
240,Anxiety,Anxiety and addiction treatment therapy,"Hi everyone.

Since i switched new antipsychotics. My anxiety became more aware. My therapists tell me I’m addicted to sedatives and alcohol because I use those for my anxiety. I will have to get therapy for my addiction as well. As I’m not addicted to alcohol or sedatives, I can go without easily if I wouldn’t have anxiety this much. But if my anxiety won’t go away I will get physically addicted as well as I’m mentally addicted to numbing my anxiety. 

Anyone have been in the same boat? And how has addiction-treatment therapy helped you?"
241,Anxiety,I missed my driving lesson,"I missed it because my alarm was turned off. New update on my phone doesn’t turn on alarm automatically when I set the time anymore and I didn’t know. 

My teacher called me 8 times and my mom told me I’m a waste of money. 
I cried so much. I have to walk the dog now but I’m scared my teacher will see me somehow and tell me how mad she is. I’m also scared she’ll text me something."
242,Anxiety,I JUST WANT TO SLEEP HELP,So for the past week as I am on my 7th week back of zoloft after terrible SSRI withdrawals (I was on it previously for 2 years) my hallucinations has been through the roof and I am terrified. They have been worse at night. Everytime I drift off to sleep I hear a DING and it jolts me awake or I’ll hear a voice. I heard “oh no” as I was falling asleep and it shot me right awake and now I’m wired. It’s like my brain doesnt want me to sleep bc everytime I try a auditory hallucination wakes me right on up. Yesterday as I was trying to sleep I closed my eyes to sleep and had a vivid closed eye hallucination of a guy waving goodbye and it made me jump awake. I’m scared and I don’t know what to do. I’m lost and I feel like I have no way out besides death to stop this. I have a schizophrenic sister and I am terrified. I can’t take it!

244,Anxiety,Anxiety about lifedirection and relationship,"Hi all

Im (27/F) currently in a serious state of anxiety and would love some outside takes on my situation. 

Relevant:  I've been diagnosed with GAD since very young. Usually it's controlled and only shows up frome time to time when many life changes are present or I am particularly stressed. 

Right now most of my stress and anxiety stems from the fact that I very recently got married and feel like the whole thing is making me question all my life choices and if I can live up to everybodies expectations. 

I am currently 27 and have gotten married to my high school boyfriend, whom I've been together with since 17. We have - of course - changed a lot throughout the years, but I actually feel like it has been very good for our relationship - we truely work wonderfully together. He's my favorite person and the one I truely feel like I can share everything with. I've also expressed all of this to him. I love him dearly and really believe we will have a wonderful lige together. I see myself having children with him in the near future. 

We got engaged two years ago, and all througout the process of planing the wedding I've been exited and felt like it was a very natural course for our relationship. But about 1 month before the wedding I was fit with crazy anxiety, mostly revolving around if we are too young and if we/I have experienced enough in life. The best way I can describe it is as a quater-life crisis. 

I really dont know how to get through this. I have elevated heartbeat, sweats, chest pains. When I truely sit down and think about us, I feel calmer - because my logical self understands that I really love him and that marriage does not change anything in our relationship - as he says ""well, if it doesn't work out, we could just get a divorce, it doesn't have to be the end of everything"" but I feel like my ind can't seperate that marriage does mean something much more significant. I feel like everybody have expectations, and will ask about whats for us now. It makes my head dizzy. 

I feel like it has come out of nowhere and is ruining something I really want to feel exited about. 

I see a therapist and have (as of today) made an appointment with my doctor about medication. I feel like the anxiety symptoms makes me unable to think clearly about all of it, and therefore hope that medication will help - but I also know that it might not. I really do not want to act rashly. 

Do you have any advice to handle my situation? 

Sorry about the english, it's not my first language."
245,Anxiety,got out of anxiety + depression and here's how,"I started to notice how every time I was anxious, sad, or angry, it was because I was using too much of my head. In other words, I was overthinking too much, like right now. Then, I stopped thinking and could see, hear, feel, smell, and taste again. It was like thinking blocks your entire view of what's going around.

I went outside, and put my attention to how everything sounded. Even the cars, dogs barking, and the wind blowing all sounded equally peaceful. This all helped me stop thinking sexually, be happy consistently, and be way more productive.

A mindset I started to apply was not allowing myself to be anxious ever again. When I feel slightly anxious, straight up just said to myself 'no, not again. Stop thinking about the future it hasn't happened yet.'

There are people who just want to be anxious. For those, do what makes you happy more often. If you have no clue, look around and try as much things as you can. I hope I could help"
246,Anxiety,art sharing anxiety and imposter syndrome,"I wanted some advice from others who have shared similar experiences to mine. 

I draw digital art for a hobby and participate in an anime fandom by drawing fan art. I have terrible anxiety when I try to share art. My anxiety is worse with larger social media platforms but is easier to manage in small discord servers. I find myself deleting art I've posted on discord servers often and only sharing a very small percentage of art that is usually ""funny"" on social media. 

I don't have many bad experiences with sharing art. I generally don't care if people dislike my art and I thrive off of genuine feedback. I get horribly overwhelmed and flustered from positive comments. It raises my anxiety and I want to delete what caused me to be overwhelmed. It makes me anxious when people collect my art like pokemon cards with an abnormal disconnect where they can't understand the art was made by a human being. I get anxious when people treat me weird like I'm some intimidating celebrity. 

I have terrible imposter syndrome. My art has significantly improved in the last 2yrs because I met 2 people who are professional artists with college degrees and work experience. They have been teaching me. It took me a year to accept I was an artist and not just a healthcare worker. I feel like I can't take credit for my art because it's technically the talent of my friends who taught me and not my own abilities. I have difficulty accepting payment for commissions and it took me a long time to price myself appropriately. I have difficulty accepting that my art may be considered ""good"" when I feel like I'm constantly stagnant and needing improvement.

If people have had similar experiences, how do you handle the anxiety associated with imposter syndrome and the anxiety of your art being perceived? How do you not become overwhelmed and anxious with positive feedback?"
247,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, is anyone afraid of the chosmos? So much that when you think about it you can trigger a panick attack? I remember having this fear since I was little",
248,Anxiety,what should I do,Would doing LSDs after doing DMT 5 hours later and still feel high
249,Anxiety,Some words that could help,"I just find this sub and I want to say some things.

1. This is the second time I am going through anxiety and it  is a hard and weird thing to experience and I know you could feel like you don’t remember how it is to feel normal but you will feel normal and good again and in the same way don’t remember how it was to feel anxious all the time or even understand how could you were in that state.

2. What you are experiencing is real, all the symptoms and is because your body is in a state of stress, even if you are calm or relaxed most of the time your body is still affected and alert. so give it some time to heal and don’t give up to stress thinking is not going away, it will go, I promise.

3. If you can, seek for treatment and follow it with confidence, sometimes is scary to take this kind of meds but we have to trust experts and do all we can to be well, also change everything you can that is stressing you, is hard but you have to try and even if is just 1 thing you can change it will be a little less stress for your body.

4. I hope you feel well soon and better each day 💜"
250,Anxiety,Sertraline made me very sick,"I started my first dose of 25mg Sertraline yesterday. I took it at 10pm, after food with water. I had mild nausea at 3-4am. Didn't think much and went to sleep. I woke up at 6am with a violent urge to vomit, however there was nothing coming out. I was having cold sweats and feeling faint, and ended up going to the hospital. They administered Ondansetron via IV.

12 hours later, I'm still having nausea and feeling horrible.Didnt manage to eat a thing today. Perhaps I have some sort of SSRI intolerance? Tried 2.5mg Lexapro and I also had bad nausea 6 hours after taking it. It was much worse with Sertraline however.

I would rather stuffer with my anxiety than to suffer the side effects of this drug. Working with my psychiatrist to try something else and hopefully it works out."
251,Anxiety,I accidentally hit a car's back windscreen wiper with my elbow,"And now I am afraid that I broke something, although I felt nothing breaking, other than perhaps my elbow as it did hurt.

I am about to leave this country in a couple weeks and I am very afraid of owing something and remaining unaware of it, it was a small Tesla car.

I am feeling so much anxiety right now because of this..."
252,Anxiety,I ruined my only friendship with my own cowardice.,"Yesterday I was due to leave to travel abroad and meet a long time internet friend; for the few weeks leading to yesterday I was terribly anxious and every fiber in my body wanted to cancel due to my extreme social anxiety and fear of being away from home, but I held on thinking ""it'll pass"".

For context, I haven't left my bedroom in 3 years, I only go outside to see my therapist and psychiatrist, whom prescribes me antidepressants, antipsychotics and xanax, I get anxiety from taking out the trash, so I don't know what I was thinking when I agreed to travel 2000 miles away from my home.

Days go by and my anxiety only gets worse, I'm unable to eat or sleep as the date of the trip gets closer, but on the surface I was still acting confident to try and fool myself into thinking this was a good idea.

So the day arrives, I was due to leave at midnight to be there in the morning, anxiety levels are sky high, and only two hours before I had to leave I finally broke down and had a full on panic attack, during which I cancelled the trip and locked myself into my room, and spent the rest of the night crying and hugging my pillow.

Now my one and only friend is deeply hurt by my actions, and I have a feeling that there's no coming back from this.

I have nothing left to lose now, my chest is burning and I just want to disappear."
253,Anxiety,Need help for anxiety and depression,"I (17M) have been suffering from severe anxiety and social anxiety my whole life, from about 4-5 years of age. I was first diagnosed in 2011, and then put under medication for it. I became addicted to it. The medicine was then abruptly stopped in September 2018, after about 7 years. 

This caused me to go into severe depression. I had manic episodes, dissociative episodes, depressive episodes and suicidal tendencies. I was taken off from school for a year. I started another medicine, which helped me greatly and almost cured me, but caused me to gain an excessive amount of weight (30 kgs). My parents put me in an alternative school in Oct '19, which basically means a smaller class size, less pressure and more freedom for the students. I spent about 3 years there, and passed 10th grade in May '22. I was comfortable there and made a few good friends. Then, a couple of months ago, I was put in a mainstream school, and I just could not adjust to the environment. 

Schooling has been a major issue for both me and my parents my whole life. When I was a child, my mother used to sit with me in class everyday for 3-4 months. I would vomit every day. As I grew older, joined other schools and went through different experiences, my mother obviously no longer had to sit with me, but my anxiety was always there. Sometimes it was so bad that I could not function properly, other times it was a little less severe.

Back to the point. After attending the new school for about a month, things were no better. I was undergoing major anxiety attacks everyday before school, and at school, I felt completely alienated and just separate from everyone and everything. I wasn't able to focus in class. After such a long break from regular schooling, I was unable to adapt to this environment. We decided to consult a new psychiatrist and counsellor. They changed my medicines completely, but this time, instead of abruptly stopping them, they were phased off gradually, over the period of a month.

I tried another school, and it was better than the first one, but this time, my issue was not with anxiety. I have been attending this school for a month now, and feel comfortable there, and am starting to make a few friends. Now that my medicine has been phased off completely, my depression has come back again. I have lost my appetite. I feel exactly like I used to 4 years ago. At school, I am completely numb, and I feel extremely low and have no energy. I am barely able to get through the classes, much less pay attention. I do not feel like doing anything. The simple task of getting up in the morning feels exhausting, much less getting through an 8-hour school day. I don't know what to do. Perhaps I should ask the doctor to continue the medicine again, but that way, how will I ever get out of it? I can't take it for the rest of my life. I need to stop it. I am considering homeschooling. My father is for it, but my mother is against it. 
I feel helpless. My doctor doesn't feel helpful, my parents neither.

Could somebody please give me advice on how to get out of this situation? What should I do? How can I get better?"
254,Anxiety,Heightened anxiety causing issues in relationship,"My boyfriend and I have been together for a year, and I am deeply in love with him. Recently due to anxiety mixed with identity issues (we’re both Indians by background) I’ve been starting more fights spurred by anxiety of the future. We’ve not been able to see each other frequently for the last two months due to travel/other commitments, and I feel like my anxiety is out of control. A lot of these arguments are about me not having certainty over fairly minor issues in hindsight or feeling like small things (I.e. him not replying to my messages frequently, which I know is my own issue and unreasonable to spiral). During our arguments he is fairly quiet and hears me out.

I’m not sure how to go back to normal after we’ve had these arguments spurred by anxiety, how to apologize enough or even stop getting anxiety about the anxiety. I feel like all I can think about sometimes after an argument is how undeserving I am to be with someone so patient and the problems I cause in his life. I don’t know how to get out of this headspace.

I usually used to smoke weed for anxiety, but have stopped that for about 8-9 months, and have no other coping mechanism except let myself spiral/isolate myself even further. 

My chest gets tight frequently when things are bad, often unable to eat or concentrate on anything else. I’m not on medication but I do see a therapist.

TLDR; how to get back to normal after having fights spurred by anxiety"

258,Anxiety,advice on keeping contact with mom,"My parents are spliting since my mom was not happy with the relationship and was just done with it.  When she said they were splitting things got heated and she left and ended up getting a restraining order.

I still love both of them and want to keep in touch with my mom without my dad getting pissed at me for it. Idk what to do. I want a solution that does not make anyone paronoid or mad as my dad still pays my car insurence and phone which i need and am not in a position to loose rn."
259,Anxiety,Could this be due to a panic attack?,"So, I have a history of anxiety - always been an anxious person, clammy hands, anxiety and panic attacks, I was on sertraline for a while a few years ago as well as propranolol. 

I work in IT, and I caused a massive outage in one of the departments network wise. All pressure was on me, I didn’t even realise it but I ended up with sweat literally dripping down my face, fast heart rate, clammy hands, etc… whilst trying to fix the problem. 

I assume this was a panic attack. 

Everyday since, I’ve not been right. 

I have brain fog, and the only way I can describe it is like I’m half under water whilst the rest of the world is above ground. I can hear what people are saying to me but there’s either a delay in processing it or I can’t process it. 

Nothing feels real. 

I keep pressing the wrong buttons on my phone, and I can’t read information properly. Even typing this is hard! 

My hands are also incredibly clammy. 

Could this be due to what happened earlier this week? Could I still be feeling the effects? 

I’m worrying it’s something else but I was fine before the outage happened. 

I’m also massively fatigued.

If I actually sleep it’s super stressful. I sleep maybe 2-4hrs a night … I just want to be like others where they can sleep. The only thing that keeps me okay is Ativan… I take 1-2mgs at night depending on how bad I feel. I know it’s not a long term solution. I try not taking it every night so I don’t get used to it.

263,Anxiety,Really need support right now.,"You know how everyone’s solution to mental illnesses is tell someone? I can’t. My anxiety is literally stopping me from telling my mum.
I was thinking about how my mum doesn’t really listen while driving. I mean, you tell her something unimportant to her and she’ll just say yup or mhm. Like if I tell her about my day. That thought got me spiralling into an anxiety attack about how if I told her about everything (anxiety, OCD, horrid intrusive thoughts, friends fighting, etc.), she would brush it off and ignore me.
I can’t tell anyone at school either. I basically have three versions of myself. Class me- the lonely girl who talks to no one and basically no one knows. Friend me- chatty, friendly me with a cool mum and lots of pets. And home me- the empty shell of a person only tied down by music and video games. If I told my friends about home me, I can’t help but fear that they would think I’m crazy and slowly cut me off.
I’m on no medication and have no therapy because my mum doesn’t know how bad it is, but I really want to talk to someone.
Can anyone help me??"
264,Anxiety,I got diagnosed with GAD and given Zosert 25mg everyday for 2 weeks. Should I take the meds?,"I'm 20M having severe procrastination problems, loneliness and general sadness everyday (for the past month they were severe that I felt that the need to get consulted). I had went to a psychiatrist initially for ADHD, Depression and Anxiety diagnosis but the psychiatrist only paid attention to the first 10-15 mins of what I was saying (I was talking about anxiety), and didn't question anything related to ADHD (like whether I had problems paying attention or anything), and mainly questioned related to anxiety and depression. She also gave me an ink-blot test for some reason, I don't know why.

Finally she said she had to go soon to check other patients, so she said ""you don't seem to have other problems, it's just anxiety, and I'm giving you a prescription for it"" and gave a prescription for GAD and said to take Zosert 25mg at 9 AM everyday for 2 weeks. I asked about the side effects and she said there's none. I also asked why she didn't question about ADHD symptoms and she said ""ADHD doesn't come suddenly, and usually starts at childhood.. since you're having problems only for this month, it can't be ADHD"". I did mention again that I've had attention problems for longer.. like 6 years or more.. but she didn't consider it..

And as she left she told a psychologist to substitute for her.. The psychologist asked further questions about anxiety and stuff.. and said stuff like ""you're 20 and you are lonely and aren't working out or exercising or anything.. you're too young to be weak.. you need to get yourself together and start doing stuff.."". I then mentioned that I've been trying to get on a work out schedule for ages but it's been really hard to set up a schedule and then following it is even harder.. for this she replied ""you just need to push yourself and do it. There's no other option."". There's a thing with ADHD people and procrastinating too much.. Idk if she even gave a thought to it..

In the beginning, when I listed all my symptoms she literally said like ""it feels like you just googled the symptoms for these 3 problems and then recited it to me.. I don't think you have them.. don't google stuff related to these again"".. like cmon, people do google stuff but I do have some of those symptoms I'm not just pulling them out of my ass you know.. but they didn't care and diagnosed for just GAD.. And I also doubt if whatever they did was right.. like why ink blot test all of a sudden for me? Isn't it usually done for schizophrenic people?

So after all this I'm wondering if I should take the meds due to the lack of credibility of these doctors.. They literally said there's no side effects for Zosert when I asked about it, but a quick google tells you plenty.. I don't want to get on meds as I don't want my life to become dependent on them.. I'm also worried about side effects and withdrawal symptoms.. what should I do?"
265,Anxiety,my anxiety is eating me,"It's been a week or so but i can't still sleep.

I don't know what is happening but all i know is it's getting worst each day. I also don't cry. I just stare in the unknown for hours. I can't shut down my thoughts it's louder than before. I am pressured because i am graduating this year and the expectations that my parents gave me is so high that i don't think i can ever reach. My self esteem is pretty low. I have no one to talk to. I'm having relationship problems and it's stressing me out so much. I just feel that i can't trust anyone anymore. I am so tired. I haven't comb my hair and i tried self harming because i can't feel anything and i regret doing it. My sister and i is sleeping in the same room and i thought it will help me but it is all the same i still can't sleep. I also spend time with my family to feel that bond but still nothing.

I finally realized the big drops give me the most anxiety because I’m on edge of what’s coming next, they’re usually followed by fireworks, fire shooting up etc. I hate it, I just have a complete sensory overload. 

Last night, I came to the conclusion that I think I attended my last music event with him and it made me really sad.

273,Anxiety,Tired of life,"I'm so sick and tired of feeling like crap everyday. Medication only makes me feel worse. I have a fear of vomiting and SSRIs only made me want to puke. CBT didn't really do much for me.

274,Anxiety,"Is this anxiety, an anxiety attack or a panic attack?","Lately after my suicide attempt and my docs changing me from Paroxetine to Pristiq, I’ve generally been feeling sick (nauseous) very often. Every time I leave the house I desperately just want to go home because I don’t have the energy (thanks to severe depression), and all I want to do is to go home and cry because I feel so unsettled and just sick to my stomach. It has made me want to quit my job and skip my dance classes because I don’t want to leave the house anymore. It’s been harder to get a full breath in all the time. 

Sometimes I then start to breathe extra hard and I start to have a foggier brain (like my brain is stuffed with cotton) and my ears get tunnel hearing and becomes sensitive to all sounds. My body starts to feel very distant from me. I start checking my pulse because I get heart palpitations. My hands start to get pins and needles (probably due to my breathing). I start feeling so uncomfortable that I cry. 

I’ve never considered myself to have anxiety (but apparently my pdoc thinks I do have anxiety with the depression), but I do have PTSD. I’m starting to think my general anxiety is showing up though, with all these fears of going to my job or leaving the house. I don’t know if these attacks with all those symptoms I shared above is the result of a PTSD episode (although I don’t notice any specific triggers), if they are panic attacks, if they are anxiety attacks, or just normal anxiety. 

If someone could clue me in, that would be so helpful. Just sitting here crying after one of these episodes rn."

keeping it short, I have been on many antipsychs for years (5 years total)   including   Quetiapine, Haloperidol,  Aripiprazole, Olanzapine ,   Carbamazapine and  didn't have any lasting side effects with any of   them; and now my Doctor  prescribed me Trifluoperazine

I  read that it has a high chance of giving you permanent tardive    dyskinesia , but by the fact that tardive dyskinesia is a side effect of    all of the antipsychotics is there a chance that I would take it from    Trifluoperazine ?

277,Anxiety,Dying from Anxiety,"Need serious help, feel lost and don't know what to do. Medical help isn't an option for me and neither is a therapist.

 used to be the most chill and laid back person in the world, and enjoy every second of my life. Oh how that has changed. I don't know what led to my anxiety being like this, but it keeps getting significantly worse. To begin, last year I got into a relationship where my partner acts in a way I am not used to (ie: not resolving a fight immediately, leading me to have a panic attack lasting from the fight's start to finish which can often last multiple days). I believe the relationship has a strong impact on my anxiety at times. Next, not being friends with my best friend anymore could be a factor, which happend about one year ago. Without her, I feel like I am all alone in the world. When we were together, I felt like the best version of myself possible and extremley confident and happy. That feeling is no longer present, ever.

My anxiety is so bad up to the point where at every second in the day, it feels like an elephant is sitting on my chest. I spend all day crying in my bed, freaking out for no reason. I can't sleep unless I smoke weed. I constantly am nervous, and have panic attacks that can last hours. I constantly am shaking and resisting the urge to cry.

 I am feeling depression about my life and want to change everything: move to another country, get all new friends, etc. I just don't want to regret my choice. Either way, this change wouldn't be able to happen for a year. But I really don't want to live another year miserable and unable to function properly. Please help, I have no idea what to do or why I have become like this."
278,Anxiety,Anxiety hampers my productivity and lowers my self-esteem,"I set certain goals for myself and try to do my best to achieve them but whenever I try to focus on any productive activity intrusive thoughts make it very difficult for me to focus. For example, I may obsess over feeling degraded or insulted by how someone treated me especially if someone insults me for making a mistake even if it is minor because then the insult has some validity and I take that personally even if there's nothing personal about it and the person who insults me knows is a complete stranger. I know I should focus on my mistake but can't get over feeling degraded or humiliated and let that person's behaviour affect my self-esteem. Other than that I may feel excessive guilt over something I did and feel that I do not deserve a sense of fulfilment if I am able to focus and use my time productively. Then I feel very upset that I could not use my time productively despite trying my best to because my intrusive thoughts make it very difficult for me to function. Has anyone experienced something similar? How did you cope with it?"
279,Anxiety,Scary feeling do I have a brain tumor lol,"Hello, I’m a 24(f) and I honestly used to struggle with anxiety a lot but as I’ve grown up it hasn’t been a major issue. I have things that scare me but it doesn’t stop me from doing them. The only major thing I’d say is I don’t drive bc anxiety…which I will be forcing myself to start doing soon.

I have a good job, and a good life. Luck always seems to find me. But lately things have been so hard and I’ve been getting this horrible disgusting creepy feeling.

I’ve had a lot of big life changes lately. My boyfriend and I bought our first house and my nana (my dads mom) passed away. She is the first grandparent to go and I’ve never experienced the death of someone close to me before until now.

I have a really hard time moving and change is a struggle for me. I know it’s gross but I usually don’t feel comfortable showering for the first two weeks until I’ve deep cleaned the shower 10 times and I haven’t even set foot in the bath yet despite all my scrubbing. It’s just been a struggle. Things aren’t perfect and it feels like it’s one thing after the other with my new house. 

Then amongst that my nana dies and I took a day off work then went back and I am barely making it. I’m so tired and burnt out. 

Then the past couple weeks, well really this feeling started when we moved in on august 4th, I’ve been getting this horrible sickly feeling that starts in my head and goes in a wave through my body and ends in the pit of my stomach. I feel dizzy, nauseous and scared.

This weird deja vu usually triggers it. It’s like I’m recognizing things and situations from my dream. I’ve had deja vu before but never this often and it’s never sent me into such a horrible feeling. It’s a feeling of absolute dread, like impending doom. It lasts for about 30 seconds and I’m left feeling confused and scared, and anxious. 

Does anyone know what this feeling is? I’ve gone through a lot in my life, the abuse of an ex, dropping out of college, etc and unless my memory has blocked out all that traumatic shit it feels like this is the first time I’m experiencing this feeling."

And I really hate conflicts and tension, I hate when my family just argues with each other and sends me in to fix the stupid broken pieces. Like, it feels like they can’t take responsibility for their mistakes?

Now I feel like vomiting because I couldn’t do anything and the next few days are either going to be tense and cold or a fiery argument. I sort of feel like it’s my fault too because I was just so useless in mitigating the situation."

Everything is clear im healthy besides vitamin D deficiency. I was insanely anxious/stressed trough out this whole proccess since i google about heart stuff. It never left. Went back home but now since my heart is healthy, my brain found another problem, maybe its a brain tumour or maybe that cyst in my thyroid that my doctor found turned cancerous? Ive been on an endless cycle. This started around mid july and its been a bit over a month now. I went from slight worry to common numbness,pins and needles in my arms, legs, head, Possibly insomnia cause i keep waking up every night and also feel exausted trough out the day, brain fog (Why i think its a brain tumour), chest pain. Im going to get my stomach checked next week due to chest pains. If they find nothing im afraid i won't be able to keep my sanity. I want to see a doctor again this time maybe tell them about these thing i developed over the month and either get help or get sent to psychiatrist or something, but i cannot i already went to a doctor and i missed my chance to tell them, my parents are very annoyed, they will most likely get mad and refuse to take me. Im at a point where i feel like i might break down, i feel like i want to cry but tears just don't come out.

288,Anxiety,Should I seek help for my anxiety?,"**I tried posting this from a throwaway but the post was deleted and the account banned, so I'm doing it again from my main.**

*Kind of a long post, but please read all of it, I need some advice.*

Recently it feels like my anxiety has gotten worse than ever before. I feel nauseous multiple times a day, and it's lasted on occasion for more than an hour. It's not like I need to throw up immediately, but it's this constant feeling in my stomach that occasionally makes me feel like I have to retch, and it makes it kinda difficult to eat (on top of worrying making me lose my appetite). And today when this happened, for a few minutes, my stomach hurt as well, which is new.

Sometimes when I get really anxious I also start shaking really badly and feeling pins and needles in my face and hands (this doesn't happen very often, but it has happened before so I thought I'd mention it). I don't know if this is an anxiety attack though because I can still talk/text somewhat normally and it's not like I'm absolutely consumed by worrying, even though it's constantly in my head.

And at other times I find myself breathing weirdly because of this strange feeling in my chest, and it's like I can't sit still, so I have to shake my hands and I'll be restless.

For context, I have been told by a psychiatrist that I have OCD before, and I was on medication for a while, but right now it's not as bad and I find it somewhat manageable, though sometimes I still struggle with rumination. All of my physical compulsions seem to be gone for now, though.

I know a lot of this is characteristic of anxiety, but my brain keeps telling me it's not real and that I'm faking it for attention, and that I *want* to be like this, which isn't true, but it feels so real to me. And especially today I asked a friend if they also feel nauseous due to anxiety, and they said it's very, very common, especially in Gen Z, so now I feel like I'm making a big deal out of something that happens to everyone, but I still don't want to feel like this every day.

Sorry for the long post, but I'm really confused and would really like some advice, please. Should I see a psychiatrist about this?"

A symptom I have at random, no rhyme or reason is this body sensation. Sinking/going over a hill is something I read a lot but I don’t think this sensation is likewise. Maybe a little bit but my sensation is hard to explain. It’s a body rush. My body will feel faint. An empty/fading like sensation consumes me. Starts in the arms, up my chest and neck. I get hot, tense, sometimes I’ll have “impending doom”. These can happen multiple times a day or not at all. They last seconds. Sometimes if they’re more intense, my hearing goes muffled. It feels like if it lasted any longer I’d pass out or die. Anyone have this? No amount of breathing, ice or staying calm helps because they come on and leave so quickly."

294,Anxiety,Panic Betwixt Sleeping and Wakefulness,"Apologies for the title, I just wanted an excuse to use the word 'betwixt'. Also TRIGGER WARNING for people with a fear of death.

I've long dealt with GAD and Panic Disorder but there is an experience that I've had that doesn't quite fit in either category. 

It stems from my fear of dying/non-existent. I've had this fear for as long as I can remember. It used to manifest through the day along the lines of: realizing that I'm actually alive in this moment (a very lucid feeling), then realizing that one day I will die, and finally realizing the inescapable inevitability of the end of my own existence. This would send me into what I would now describe as a panic attack. 

This occurred throughout much of my childhood until around middle school when I began to understand the feeling as anxiety and started learning ways to cope with it. By highschool the daytime-dying-disasters had largely ceased but in their stead I began to experience a sort of ""night terror"". I put it in quotes because I don't know if that's actually what it is. To my mind, night terrors usually happen when you are asleep not in-between

Basically, it was much like the aforementioned daytime panic attacks except it would only occur as I was falling asleep (not while I was sleep nor before I fell asleep). I would also describe them as more intense but incredibly short. The entire episode being less than a minute. I also tend to panic run put of my room or curl up on the floor.

This has occurred with varying levels of frequency through my adult life getting worse when I'm experiencing more stress or GAD but sometimes happening seemingly at random. It's hard to curb or preempt because of how quickly and intensely it occurs; by the time I'm experiencing it's too late for distractions or rationalization.

I'm curious if anyone else has experience something similar to this and if so, that they might have some additional insight to share or coping mechanisms. 

TL;DR I used to have daytime panic attacks about dying/non-existence but they've transformed into these hyper-intense very brief ""night terrors"" and I am looking for anyone with shared experiences."

297,Anxiety,why i tried to make such a promise?,"Years ago, I was trying to give up smoking but I could not. I was worrying about my health and I was also worrying that I was making christian God angry.

So, due to this stress, I tried to make a promise to christian God that I wont smoke again. I tried to ask for a non-specific punishment in case breaking the promise to ensure that I will never smoke again. I thought the fear of punishment will really help me give up smoking.

I gave up smoking but I smoked again because I missed it. I have lost my faith in christian God and now, I worry if other Gods accepted the punishment/deal.

I worry about a very bad and specific way of punishment. Something that I hadnt imagined when I tried to make the promise/punishment deal. What if other Gods got angry and considered that this way of punishment is a good way to be punished sincie I tried to ask for a non-specific punishment?

I regret tried to make that promise. I think I did not want to but I made the promise from fear and anxiety. I had full control of my words but i do not know why i made it. i was just trying to give up smoking.

do you think ocd is behind all this or not?"

299,Anxiety,Some advice on Propranolol,"Hey, I’ve been experiencing some bad mental and physical anxiety for a while now. I went to my GP there today and was prescribed Propranolol. I know it’s mainly used for blood pressure and to lower the heart rate. I’m really put off it due to it being a beta blocker, my family has a long history of heart conditions and although I’m fine, I’m worried incase it’s going to have a bad effect on me.

They know how I feel and they continued to tell me how stupid it was that I felt that way and they were just invalidating my feelings. For crying out loud I'm even on medicine that doesn't seem to help me. Seems like they are trying to make me feel even worse than I do of every  minute I'm awake.

301,Anxiety,HOW!?,"How am I supposed to live my life and enjoy it when I'm always worrying about getting old and dying!??? (among a multitude of other things) I'm freaking TERRIFIED of the idea of being extremely old and weak and dying alone in my house or wherever I will be living and my body just  r o t s  there. Also every night as I'm trying to sleep I get hit with dread knowing I'm going to die one day and not knowing what will happen after is SO scary. My body full on shakes and I sweat and can't breathe it is horrendous.

I also worry about the inbetween things like one day I might be married and have a kid. This would mean I'd have to do everything I'm anxious about with them. Take them to school? Stress. Deal with all of their health problems and appointments? Stress. Teach them driving skills? Im going to die. Speak up for them when they can't? I can hardly order food for myself. I want a kid one day but there's so much more anxiety I'd have to bear. If I never have a kid that takes me back to being old like who's going to take care of me when I'm old? I won't even have a family to love and be loved by since my parents would be dead.

And then there's the job aspect of things. I kept having freaking panic attacks at my last job and I'd be so tired from puking my guts out before leaving for work I'd just call in sick. Now I'm out of a job and have to get a new one which I'm going to be miserable at since everything I can do is customer service or retail since I only have a high school diploma AND I'M FXCKING ANXIOUS ALL THE TIME. 

Every aspect of life gives me SO MUCH anxiety I can't even write everything here. Sometimes I even get anxiety when I'm about to call my own mother on the phone.

302,Anxiety,I did a good job managing my anxiety.,"Hey friends!
Last week, I had my first car accident ever. Beforehand, I was diagnosed with GAD, and I always have anxiety issues with a lot of things, especially driving. I’ve been taking meds to manage my anxiety, followed by mild depression and schizoaffective disorder.
Anyways, I thought I will get an anxiety attack if I get into a car accident, but surprisingly I remained calm. I didn’t take a deep breath as I should have. I wasn’t having any anxiety or panic attacks. A little shaky? Yes, but no major attacks.
However, it was my fault that I made an improper lane which my driver side mirror scratched that guy’s pickup truck and I literally lost my mirror. I ended up getting a traffic ticket and would have to take driving improvement course, which I don’t mind.

In the end, I’m very proud of myself for managing my anxiety issues, especially when I was feeling under pressure during stressful situations. Just wanting to share y’all my experience."

309,Anxiety,"New here, would like advice.","Hi everyone! I’m new here and would just like some advice. My anxiety stems from my step father yelling at me constantly as a child. My mom used to step in and get mad at him for yelling at me, but there were days where I’d literally walk in the door from elementary school and get yelled at for no reason. I’m now afraid of people getting mad at me or yelling at me, which I know is a part of life but it the thought gives me severe anxiety. We later found out he has bipolar disorder. Lately I’ve been having these daily thoughts of “everyone hates me, and “I have a feeling people always talk crap about me when I’m not there.” I think it stems from being called annoying every now and then in high school. The thing is I have no friends and I’ve always had trouble making them. I do actively seek out friendships and even initiate wanting to hang out or plan lunches but I myself never get invited to anything or get asked to hang out. I just always wonder what I do wrong. I generally think of myself as a pretty friendly person and try to be optimistic but these things get to me. What would you recommend me do? I do take buspirone, but not daily. It doesn’t seem to help me much."

Holy shit though, I think that was the first time I'd felt any peace for longer than maybe 5 minutes in at least 2 years. I couldn't think at all unless I really tried so anxious thoughts just didn't come up at all, my mind is normally racing but it was just quiet. I was talking to a friend at the time too and he said don't get caught up on any negative thought and it hit me that I hadn't, normally that'd immediately make them start back up but it didn't, I just forgot to be anxious. Fucking sucks though because like I said, I don't trust myself with anything and even if I did my girlfriend wouldn't approve at all, I wish I wasn't so great at self control so I'd have that excuse but I don't. This whole post sounds stupid I know but I'm just kinda sad that the one reprieve I've found from near constant suffering is pretty much the one thing I can't do."

I don’t feel like I deserve pay for anything I do (even non-art related labor) because I’m such a burden that paying me would be a scam, so the idea of a paying job makes me want to cry. But so does the idea of living with my parents for the rest of time. I have no idea how to apply for a job or how to sell myself. I’m scared, I’m trapped, I feel horrible.

Sorry if this is a mess to read. I think I’m having a panic attack right now. I think it started when I spilled water on my pc an hour ago, and now I have to keep it powered off for a day or two to avoid damage while it’s drying. I was going to spend this time to take a break because I can’t model without it, but then I realized I don’t have the privilege to take a break. I’m wasting my parents’ money by living with them, but I’m also completely unhireable so I need to prove to myself that I can work and get things done. It’s 1:30am and i should go to sleep, but i feel like I don’t deserve sleep.

gosh, I’m a mess right now."

316,Anxiety,can’t sleep:(,trying to sleep but my throat feels tight like it’s closing… doesn’t anyone else every feel like this?:/
317,Anxiety,I'm so tired of this,"Hi, I live in Italy and in less than 2 weeks I'll go to the US on holiday.
I'm happy about that and I'm not scared of taking the plane.
Since Monday I started getting very anxious, I feel scared, my stomach hurts so bad, my throat is blocked and I feel like I would cry all the time. 
Sometimes I think I shouldn't go because this is too much to feel and I can't stand it for 10 more days.
I'm genuinely scared of myself."
318,Anxiety,airplanes,"my anxiety would shoot off sharts on airplanes .

i would be making life promises to live a better life if i ""made it"" lols ."
319,Anxiety,Quitting job,"Been planning on quitting my part time job that I've had for a year as a hostess at a busy restaurant. I got the job to help me deal with social anxiety and it has helped alot. However, it still is a pretty stressful job and it's been difficult to do during the school year. I'm planning on quitting at the end of August but I have no idea how to bring it up to my manager. I  have a hard time telling people things as I'm a people pleaser. Our restaurant is going through some major changes in management and is having a hard time keeping servers and I know me quitting is going to take a toll on the host team as I have trained all the current hosts and have been the most experienced one taking on all the more difficult shifts.

Although I understand it is not my responsibility to worry about the future of the restaurant, it is giving me so much anxiety to quit. I need to quit for the sake of school and my mental health but I genuinely do not know how to quit this job without feeling guilty. I suffer from GAD and this is just making me ruminate like crazy. 

Any advice would really help! Preferably listed step by step so I can follow it easily. Thanks!"
320,Anxiety,What is your experience quitting smoking when you have severe anxiety?,"smoking includes anything really, but my POF here is nicotine and vapes.

i have terrible anxiety, and i always hear about how stopping brings it down and makes it a bit more manageable. 

however, how did you react during the withdrawal phase? it’s a goal of mine to quit with the nicotine, but i’m quite terrified of those first few weeks where “your anxiety gets worse” from the withdrawals. 

how did you guys cope, if it was infact as bad as everyone says?"
321,Anxiety,Skipping work because of anxiety,"Hey guys. So I got this problem. I work as a customer service operator. And for the last three days, I had this overwhelming anxiety when going to work. 
I take a train in the morning, but when I arrive in the city I basically just panic and turn back. I told my boss that I had some medical problems to deal with. But I have to find a way how to overcome this. 
Is there any advice that you can give me?"
322,Anxiety,One of my worst days,"A friend came from out of state to visit family so we hung out and I was so excited to see her. Until my anxiety got the best of me. I was driving to her place and I felt a little nudge but I was able to shake it off. As soon as we started driving it just attacked me. 

The anxiety was unbearable. Nothing like I’ve felt before. It was so paralyzing. I had to pull over twice. Thank God she’s one of the good ones who understands what anxiety feels like and was so gentle and kind with what I needed in the moment. We got to the restaurant and I felt better ( I had to ice myself and my nerves calmed ) she had to drive my car back to her place. Once I left her house I had to pull over at a parking lot and completely drench myself in cold water of how bad I was feeling again. 

I’ve been crying for 4 hours already of how horrible I feel.  I think I’m reaching that boiling point of finally taking that medication that I was prescribed."
323,Anxiety,alone at vacation,"I am so proud of myself. I finally made it on vacation alone. The first day was awesome, i ran around the city, drove my car everywhere...
and today i am sitting gully dressed on the bed and can't get myself to go down there to breakfast. I simply can't. 
I wanted to see a castle later and contemplating now if i should skip the payed breakfast here and save my energy for it."
324,Anxiety,Need some reassurance right now,"I’m on vacation in a secluded cabin for the next 6 days and was very excited about it, however traveling here was incredibly difficult. Only slept two hours, dry heaved a lot and had horrible panic attack on the plane as a result of it. When I can’t sleep properly, my anxiety strikes up severely. When we got to cabin, I tried to sleep but I couldn’t. I just ate, napped a little bit, talked to my friends and family. 

No big deal, I feel asleep to a show tonight, and had a terrible nightmare, woke up to feel insane pressure on my right side and my neck hurting, and my mouth is dry. I felt extremely dizzy. It feels like I’m going through a hundred possibilities, maybe this cabin is haunted? maybe I have a tumor? am I having an aneurysm? When in reality, I’ve just been very stressed since I got here, and there’s a logical explanation to this. But why can’t I seem to connect that though to my body? It feels like I’m going crazy. 

It’s like I want to shake my body and tell it to get the fucking message but I can’t. I’m suffering."
325,Anxiety,Unshakable thoughts,"If someone with more mental health knowledge could give me some insight im at my breaking point. I have obsessive anxiety riddled thoughts that will not leave each thought lasts for months on end. It’s pretty much the only thing i’m able to think about for example my appearance, my popularity/friendships, food. When i’m not thinking about something else like work/practice etc. It’s like my baseline thought, it pretty much insures unhappiness the obsessions are so controlling and disorienting I begin loosing grip with what’s real and what my anxiety is telling me. I don’t know what’s wrong with me i’ve tried everything to change myself work on myself ,improve my mindset. I’ve tried endless personalities anything I can do to make me people like me. I’ve tried positive thinking, changing my attitude tirelessly and a million things and I cant shake the idea that everyone despises me. I feel like i’ve done everything I possibly can."
326,Anxiety,Tight chest and anxiety,I’m having anxiety and my chest feels tight and full. I don’t have a rapid heart rate though. How can I resolve this uncomfortable feeling
327,Anxiety,The paranoia won’t stop,"Every day I am convinced insects are living in my ears. It sounds crazy but I can feel them moving around, buzzing even though nothing is in my ears. I think about it constantly throughout the day and constantly feel like insects are crawling on my skin. I feel like they bite and sting me yet they leave no marks. The buzzing sounds won’t stop. At night I feel them crawl on me and hear them flying around my room. I feel delusional and don’t know why this is happening or what to do. These fears have been recurring for the past 6 months."
328,Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,[removed]
329,Anxiety,Xanax and Alc?,"This may be a stupid question but I’m digging myself into a deep panic … 

I am prescribed .25mg Xanax for PA’s and anxiety. I usually try and fight through without the pills but tonight I was having a PA so bad I needed to take one. I did however drink about half a glass of wine 4 hours earlier. I know never to mix the two but I did. Am I safe to go to sleep? Will I make it through the night ? Lol… but seriously … thanks for the responses ❤️"
330,Anxiety,Currently in the midst of another Panic Attack,"Having anxiety is terrible. One moment I’m fine the next there’s this deep feeling of impending doom although my mind knows that I’m okay my body refuses to believe it and goes into flight or fight mode. I’m feeling nauseated but I figured that the best way to beat this moment is to talk about it. I usually listen to calming music during times like this but I can’t sit still and just breathe. Being still is too overwhelming. I’ve had some major life changes occur over the past few months and little to no anxiety but as of lately it’s reared it’s head again. (I am also bipolar II) Sometimes I wish there was something I could do to just make this feeling go away immediately. I’ve tried medication, meditation, frequencies/sound therapy, breath work, and etc. but nothing prepares me from an attack. I know that I am okay, I know that the feeling is temporary but it feels like forever sometimes. I want to cry but it’s literally nothing to cry about. Sometimes I ask what is my anxiety trying to tell me. This time I think it’s trying to tell me that there’s something that is triggering me and making me feel unsafe or not in control. I have been off my bipolar meds successfully for about 7 months due to an allergic reaction i had. i took my first dose of a new med tonight. I think I have a deep fear of medications not because I feel like I don’t need them but because of all the bad experiences i’ve had. i don’t know if i want to continue taking it. although i know that it’s not directly the medication that’s causing the panic. i supposed it’s some form of ptsd im allergic to a lot of foods and meds and i usually find out through eating them or being prescribed a new medication. it’s scary and one of the many things that cause an attack (although there are times when attacks happen for no good reason) anyways thanks for coming to my tedtalk sorry for the long winded post"
331,Anxiety,I’m desperate to be back to my normal self,"For context I’ve suffered from depression and anxiety as long as I can remember. I had a bad childhood. Two years ago I started taking Zoloft and steadily kept getting better. The past year I’ve felt more or less on cloud nine. Great boyfriend, roof over my head, getting an education, mostly happy. But the past couple months or so I’ve been spiraling. All the work I had done to overcome my anxiety is crumbling. I feel like I’m in high school again ( I was so anxious and depressed it was debilitating I never left my house). I’m literally turning to Reddit because I can’t talk to my therapist every day. I’m on my phone constantly and I can’t stop. I’m paranoid about everything imaginable. I think my bf is cheating on me without any good reason. I’m literally sitting in bed and my heart is racing. I feel worthless just like I did when I was a kid. I feel ugly. I need help. Why is all my hard work reversing."
332,Anxiety,So anxious,"Me and my girl did the deed on July 12 , We had protected sex(condoms) and I didn’t ejaculate at all (I checked, plus I’m one of those guys that just can’t orgasm in condoms )
few weeks passed her period is still not coming until now ( so almost 3 weeks late ), she took pregnancy test on July 22 and it was negative (urinal , 11 days after the intercourse) ,then we went to the doctor‘a office today and get tested again (negative , so negative twice)and also did the USG.She also mentioned that she is really stressed recently ,but her expected period always come approximately early days of the month
My question is what is her chances for getting pregnant?
Can I trust the result of Pregnancy test ?
Should I still be so stressed ?
please don't judge me, I took precautions yet I'm still paranoid ,please help."
333,Anxiety,I can’t stop thinking about it,"Im about to have my g10 entrance exam
For most people it’s really simple but for me  not so much. I was barely taught anything this school year and now im about to do a test again which i will probably know very little about and I don’t know what it’s about so im trying to learn all the materials in just a few days and i just don’t think I’ll be able to pass. I can’t stop thinking about it since im most likely gonna fail this"
334,Anxiety,How do I deal with my partner’s severe anxiety and panic attacks,"My boyfriend has been dealing with severe health anxiety and panic attacks for about 8 months. His health anxiety is so bad that we’ve been to clinics and hospitals at least 20 times in the last couple months but doctors just tell him it’s anxiety. He has a really hard time believing that it’s just anxiety but it’s understandable because he has symptoms and pains all the time. This also started happening about 6 months after he went through a traumatic event but we don’t really know if that caused it. He does have ptsd and some other mental health issues. 

Other than seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist how can I help him during these episodes? I try my best to comfort him and convince him that he’s gonna be okay but it’s so intense and he really feels like he’s going to die every time. It’s like every panic attack feels different for him but it’s always the same. I just want to help him ease the stress a bit but I really don’t know what to do. It’s also been really stressful for me as well because I’m the only person he can really lean on and I can’t let him go through this alone."
335,Anxiety,I’m never drinking coffee again after what happened yesterday,"Coffee has always given me anxiety but yesterday it sent me into waves of never ending panic attacks. I thought yesterday was the worst day of my life and I just woke up now feeling better but depressed I went through that yesterday. I got so anxious and paranoid I felt physically sick all day. 

I’m so done with caffeine. Does caffeine affect anyone else like this?"
336,Anxiety,First Dentist Visit in 12 years - Anxious about how it went,"I suffer from generalised anxiety but today I did something I have put off for a very long time, I went back to the dentist. I have somewhat of a phobia of Dentists having had a very bad experience when young (drill/filling without anaesthetic age about 8, because I didn't like needles and it was not really explained to me what that would mean until...)

Anyway, I was hoping to find a dentist that would be friendly and understanding. I put on the notes that I have a dental phobia and I haven't been in a long time but I'm not proud of this and I really want to work together with a dentist to get back on track and regular visits. I went to my health insurer's dentist.

Started off ok with the dentist, he was asking about my phobia and I explained it was about the fact I hadn't been so long and that it had been dominating my thinking until now and that it was a big step for me to make this appointment and my fear is you're going to tell me all of them need to come out etc.

Anyway we get going, he does X-rays, looks at the teeth etc and then his opening statement is, well the good news is we don't have to take them all out. And then I'm thinking of this is potentially going to be quite a lot then :/ and he began to rattle the few off it was my wisdoms that I still have (which to be honest I completely expected would have to go as I know they are very hard to clean properly) and was explaining that.

So then we get talking on another topic and I said I'm really not proud of my smile and he asked why and I said because the teeth just are a bit gunky etc not pearly white and he said we can do something about that but I won't do that until I can see a commitment that you're going to come back more frequently than 12 years (fair enough, I kinda get this attitude to a degree). and he kept saying that a bit when talking about some other treatment.

He then said if you come every 12 years I'll have to shock you each time and I kept re-iterating that I want this to be a new dawn and to work together to fix this but I also understand right now this is just words. So it seemed like he went down a tough love path, which knocked my confidence a bit. He also said if I start flossing I might avoid some fillings, so again that seemed a bit weird (i get flossing, but if fillings are needed it's needed?)

Anyway just after this we had a discussion about the wisdom removal process and the dentist who would be doing the work came in and explained it and he said 'your other teeth are strong' which is obviously the opposite of the tough love bit. It seemed like the first dentist was going down a path of shocking me to come back more frequently (and I plan to anyway) whilst the second guy was a bit more encouraging. So I'm holding onto that comment.

Anyway despite this I feel really good that I've started on a path to try and get something resolved, something which has played on my mind for an extremely long time and has caused me mental anguish (the longer it went the more anguished I got). I get he's probably heard it all before from others that they will come more frequently and perhaps they don't, but I genuinely do want this to be a new dawn and am anxious about how I am now viewed by this dentist.

Need some thoughts and advice on this, please."
337,Anxiety,How to keep a past event from giving me anxiety about the future?,"I had my first job about 3 years ago and it was a disaster.  Then I worked for two years in a similar but different position where I got a lot of much needed training and experience and soon I'm going to try the first job again.  I know I'm prepared for it now, but I can't help but have the ""oh no"" thoughts.  Any advice?"
338,Anxiety,I keep worrying about the future,"I keep worrying about the future. Like what if the world ends? What if we have no more food and human existence will be erased? What happens to my family and my pets? What if global warming destroys us all? I'm so confused and worried. Even watching my favorite shows makes me worry that if I watch this, maybe something bad's going to happen. I'm so confused and I'm having breakdowns because of it. Please help."
339,Anxiety,My 6 months probation is coming up and I'm terrified.,[removed]
340,Anxiety,what to do about my director discriminating against my panic disorder,"I have a panic disorder and ever since covid it’s brought about agoraphobic issues and now that there’s a push for us to all go back into the office, I’ve been asking if I can have some workplace adjustments (working from home) so that I can ease back into travelling and going back into the office slowly and gradually. 

She made a big deal over this and escalated it to workplace relations and in a meeting with me and my direct manager she asked me why I wasn’t taking medication, she commented that seeing a psych once every 3-4 weeks wasn’t enough and she said i should see a psychiatrist because they’re more knowledgeable and “better than a psychologist”. I’m not on a executive salary like her so I can’t afford to see a psychiatrist and I genuinely feel like i am recovering but the chat I had with her made me cry pretty badly and now i feel so shit about myself and my recovery. 

Am i wrong for feeling this way? Is my director toxic? Every time i interact with her my anxiety flares up, and for the past few weeks ever since that incident, I’ve been avoiding meetings with her. Atm I don’t even want to rock up to work because I don’t want to interact with her. 

What should I do?"
341,Anxiety,Called The Ambulance For Panic Attack,"Last night I got extremely stressed out my heart was beating at around 90-100bpm, the ambulance came and checked my bpm which then shot up to 130bpm and stayed there for the next 20 minutes. I was explaining to the crew that it’s a panic attack but they weren’t listening to me, they did an ECG which came back normal then checked my blood pressure 3 times (174/90, 160/80 and 134/90) the cuff was really tight so I doubt they actually got accurate readings since one of the ambulance crew was using both hands to press it down onto my arm. After a bit my heart rate dropped into the 80-90bpm and occasionally went into the 100s. I decided against going to the ER since I felt better and I’m seeing my GP today. I don’t want them to increase my blood pressure medication since its my anxiety that is causing it to go up but I’m not sure what will happen."
342,Anxiety,I never realized I had so many panic attacks; I thought it was just the anxiety that everyone has.,
343,Anxiety,"Job anxiety is so bad, how can I survive today?","I started my first job, a week-long stint as a barman during a busy festival in my city, on Monday, and I was sort of shell-shocked after, I was kinda thrown in the deep end lol and did alright but I still think back on the many little mistakes I made. And dealing with the odd rude person just destroyed me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to go back in and do it all over again in two hours and my anxiety is awful, I'm incredibly nauseous and my mind keeps running through worst case scenarios, how can I get through today?"
344,Anxiety,My body is drained,"I had a really bad day on Sunday, it’s Wednesday and I’m still dealing with the physical repercussions. Mentally I thought I was already getting better by Monday... but my body is saying otherwise. I’m just so tired, can’t focus, work, socialize... I’m tense. I have no appetite and a pit in my stomach. Does anybody else feel that 1 bad day can have a negative effect on the entire week to come? That event though the “issue” that was making me anxious was resolved, seems like my body hasn’t gotten the memo yet."
345,Anxiety,"I tend to subconsciously hold my breath when speaking a long sentence, so I often can't get my last few words out. Any of you guys experience this?",
346,Anxiety,Tips of overcoming pill anxiety,"Hi.

I need to take larger than normal pills (it's important) and I am now researching how to do it. I can't cut them, they need to be swallowed. I have major pill phobia. Whenever I try to swallow even a small pill, I gag or think it gets stuck and I'm suffocating. (I associate swallowing pills with hospitalisation or dying)

I never had a pill stuck in my throat, thank God but it happened that few pills took a loong time to go down and it felt as if they were stuck. Yes, this is a psychological issue and not a physical issue.

If I wasn't scared of swallowing pills, I wouldn't pay the slightest attention to how I'd take them. But I am very anxious and panic right before the time I need to take the pill (I even think about the pill weeks before I buy it).

The root cause of this issue might be that my own parents had the exact issue. One of them even chocked with pills and I saw that happening as a child. Hence, the fear. 

So, yes, it's in the family.

Please tell me if this phobia can be overcome. Also, please don't give classic advice of just taking the pill with a lot of water or apple sauce/yoghurt. It wouldn't work. I think taking the pill with water makes it even worse for me. Not sure why but, last time I took some pills, I had to use so much water for just one pill. If you flood your mouth/throat with water yet the pill still doesn't go down smoothly, then the problem is not the water. Right? 

I hope someone discovered a way to overcome this nasty phobia and shares it with me. Thanks."
347,Anxiety,Canceled a trip last minute due to anxiety,"A friend of mine is having a baby soon and invited me to visit at her house for a few days at the end of her summer vacation.

Today is the day I am supposed to do the 8 hour drive and I just can’t bring myself to do it. I feel terrible canceling at the last minute but the anxiety is too much. The reasons not to go are strongly outweighing any desire to go: I hate driving, the drive is too long, I don’t feel safe driving that far alone, and it’s too expensive in terms of fuel and travel insurance. My travel anxiety is just crippling. I wish I said no right away when I was first invited."
348,Anxiety,Different treatments,"hello! has anybody been through different meds for anxiety and/or depression? when i first started going to the psychiatrist she prescribed me benzos, then prozac, then i took prozac and benzos, then she put me on xanax and prozac and now i am on cipralex, lexapro and mirtazapine + xanax IF necessary (i am not addicted to it, i consider it is necessary only when i cannot focus because i am too anxious - but she prescribed the last ones because what she started me on initially was not strong enough) 
also, i have seen a few members here report issues with their memory so if anyone has had these experiences in the past please lmk, i am not sure whether changing so many treatments has had an impact on my anxiety and depression or not"
349,Anxiety,Why am I oversharing constantly?,"When I'm bonding with someone I just need to overshare every single thing from my life. Then, of course, I'm overthinking every single sentence that I wrote and I'm usually embarrassed by what I told the other person. Then I start to lose control over my emotions and I basically freak out and apologize out of fear of being abandoned by that person somehow??? How the fuck can I stop this pattern?! I'm afraid I will push everyone if I continue like this. I look like a fool.

352,Anxiety,Hello. Would really appreciate the any support right now. Mom went to get a blood test and I’m convinced she has cancer.,"Mom has some blood tests she had to have done a while now but got busy and forgot about them. 

She’s been kinda nauseous lately and yesterday she got really scared after becoming lightheaded at work. She’s kinda hypochondriac, so she became a bit worried but wanted to remain calm around me. She got the tests done today and will get the results in the afternoon.  

She thinks it could be diabetes. Which im not really worried about, a lot of people in are family have it and leave good lives. We come from a family of heart conditions and problems and she already has blood pressure issues that she takes medication for. It’s the fact that jt could be something worse.

What if they find cancer. Im already predicting all the treatment and stuff, what to do with the dogs, will she survive if she has it, etc.

Im really freaking out. Need help calming down"
353,Anxiety,I am facing my fear scary but exciting,"I’m currently sitting in the hairdressers and have been here almost 2 hours. I get really anxious (even severe endless panic attacks for hours) being outside my home and around loud noises/busy place eg hair dryers and loud chatting. 

The hairdresser has a  seriously laid back/relaxed personality though which I think has really helped more than she realises! I normally have panic attacks but no panic attacks so far, just some anxiety. But I’ll take that over a severe panic attack.

Sounds minor to most people but this is really scary for me! And I’m doing it :)"
354,Anxiety,Let your light shine!,"Congrats /r/anxiety we've all made it to Wednesday!

This is a weekly thread that serves as a place for us to shine some light on what is going well in our lives. It is easy for mental health subreddits to focus primarily on the negative, after all we're not here because everything is going wonderfully.

But, once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right. So whether you made it out of bed today, spoke up in a meeting or class, rode the bus, or just stepped outside please share with us what went well for you in the past week.

Any accomplishment, victory, positive thought or action no matter how big or small is welcome here!"

359,Anxiety,"I don't know what to do, and neither does my therapist.","My therapist admitted she's not really sure how to help me and now I'm stuck wondering what the heck I should do.

I've had a fear of men for a very long time, now. I learned I couldn't trust them, not even family, at roughly 3 years old. I've been sexually assaulted/harassed, stalked, cornered into uncomfortable situations, treated poorly, and used enough times in my 30 years of life now that I just can't find it in me to trust men anymore. 

This has obviously been an issue in the past, but I didn't realize how big of an issue it would become.

I have my first ever male boss at my new job. I didn't realize all my other bosses had been women until I started wondering why I have such a hard time going to my new one. Then I realized... because I'm afraid of him.

He's a good guy. He is incredibly understanding. He has never done or said anything to suggest that he would be anything else. Yet somehow, no matter how hard I try, I cannot bring myself to trust him. I have such a hard time talking to him that I get physically sick (*sweating, nauseous, having to go to the bathroom a lot*) before our one-on-one meetings, because I have IBS that is worsened by anxiety. **Every time**. I went home the first couple times before I realized it was just my anxiety and not me actually being sick. 

I had it really bad one day. I went to go give him an update on something we had previously discussed and I must have stood outside his office door for ten minutes straight, unable to make myself move forward, physically shaking.

I've paced back and forth getting with in 5 feet of his door and then turning around and repeating that about seven times just about every time I've tried to go to him for literally anything. (The exception being when I'm helping a guest, because so far my will to help those who come to our office can overpower my fear if it's a situation *requiring* me to ask him what exactly needs to be done.)

I don't want this to effect my job more than it already does. I don't what him to find out in case he thinks it'll become too problematic or something. I just... I have no idea what to do or if there's anything I *can* do.

But if you read all of that, thank you. I just need to let that out somehow, and this seemed like a good place to do it. I hate keeping this inside, only really being able to talk about it with my therapist. It weighs on me quite a bit."
360,Anxiety,How can I stop worrying about someone else's issues and struggles?,"Hello! I am 18F and I have an issue with worrying too much about what other people are going through. I have anxiety and am generally a very sensitive person. 

Today, I was talking to someone on Tumblr, I know them since we both write fanfiction for the same character, but this was the first time I talked to them. I was basically coming out about a certain opinion I had regarding the fandom we were in, and they answered to me privately saying that they understand how I feel and that they are in a tough spot in their life that is ""literally rock bottom.""

I always get anxious when someone comes forward about their struggle, especially when it is mental health related since I have, in the past, had a traumatic experience regarding it. So now I am struggling internally with unwanted thoughts and my mind forcing me to do something I don't want to do. I am now worried that maybe they are depressed and might kill themselves, or maybe they are seriously sick. Since they were ambiguous about their issue, there is this voice in my head trying to force me to ask them about their issue, saying if I don't do it something even more bad will happen. But I am fighting against it saying it's a personal question and I shouldn't poke into their personal business. But also because of this, I am in a constant state of anxiety, worrying about whatever issue they are going through, and hoping it isn't too serious. 

I feel ridiculous for feeling this way because they are a person I began to talk to today and I don't know them personally or in real life. But I just can't stop worrying about whether they will be fine or not. The basic fear is that one day they might randomly message me and tell me they are going to kill themselves or die, which relates to the traumatic experience I referenced earlier. I fear they might end up dying. 

I currently don't have anyone to talk to since my psychiatrist is not available at this moment. So I feel lonely and scared.

I just want advice on how I can overcome or lessen what I am experiencing now."
361,Anxiety,Is it appendicitis or am I just anxious?,"Yesterday morning I felt a small ache in my lower right abdomen near my pelvic. Not too much pain at all, but it did cause me to worry a lot. I began searching up symptoms of appendicitis and started having a really bad panic attack. The only symptom is that small ache. So I had my dad take me to the urgent care just to check and they said if the pain gets worse or I develop any other symptoms to go to the ER. Later I stopped worrying about and didn’t focus on it and the pain went away. But this morning I started thinking about it and the small ache came back. Now whats also really stressing me out is I’m getting a small ache in my right hip and right below my right rib. Im scared theres something seriously wrong with me and I’m on the verge of panicking. Can someone reassure me and give me advice?"
362,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like this?,Does anyone feel like they are losing their mind. Like nothing feels real i feel very detached from everything. Even tho I know it’s from anxiety and or stress it’s still kinda scaring me. Does anyone know how to help with this at all.
363,Anxiety,How meditation can change your life and get rid of anxiety,"The first time I tried meditation, couldn't do it.

I was 19 years old at the time.

And healthy to me was drinking orange juice after a long night of drinking alcohol.

I kept hearing about meditation and its benefits. So I sat down alone. I closed my eyes and all I got hit with was a huge wave of thoughts that I just couldn't sit with.

Maybe meditation isn't for me it just seemed like a waste of time. And honestly, I didn't feel like I needed it. Life was good. I was having fun and I didn't have much responsibilities, little did I know meditation would one day change my life and help me uncover emotions that were stored deep in my mind, but more on that later.

Two years passed and I hit 21.

My days of getting messed up at parties aren't as often, and I have a lot more responsibilities.

There's also this really incessant need to succeed, but not the inspiring kind, a need based in fear.

You see, I dropped out of college and now that all of my friends are starting to graduate, it seemed like everyone had their life figured out.

I am no longer, OKAY, with just having fun and enjoying the moment.

I have this tattoo on my arm that says enjoy now, which was ironic because that was the last thing I was doing.

I have a deep anxiety, a fear of failure, a need for everything to happen now.

Even though I try to be healthy, my mind can go out of control.

I've never been taught to manage my own stress and thoughts. I would often burn out and binge only to come back the next day and feel guilty for taking a break. I was trying to grind my way through life. I was gaining success in my business and I was able to go full time in videography in 2019, but like a lot of other people, I was neglecting my mind.

Working all day and drinking tons of caffeine starts to amp up my anxiety and I start to feel like I'm losing control.

While watching one of my favorite YouTubers, YesTheory, they mention meditation and how it has helped them control their anxiety. So I say, screw it. Let's give it another try.

**At the time I probably meditated once a week and it was unbearable. I didn't see the point in doing nothing when there was so much that had to be done.** Eventually I hang out with a friend who was also trying to get into meditation and he was like, yo, we should meditate together.

We sit down and we put on a 10 minute guided meditation. And for some reason it was a much more profound experience. The act of meditating with a friend with another human being, with another presence, gave me a sense of calm and peace that carried on throughout the whole day.

Finally, for the first time, I felt the benefits of meditation. I felt so good about it, that I ended up buying a meditation app. And this is what changed the game for me because I'm a frugal person, so when I spent $60 on a year subscription, best believe I'm getting my money's worth.

The infrequent once a week, meditation started to turn into five time a week meditations, and I started to understand the practice.

Let your thoughts pour in and then let them go slowly.

I was convinced that meditation was helping me, but let me be honest, during my first year, I would go weeks or months without having any amazing experiences like I did the first time. Those were far and few between it took a lot of discipline and willpower to keep on meditating, but eventually it did pay off one year later.

What used to seem impossible was now actually kind of easy. I could go 10 to 15 minutes without losing my mind. The benefits are subtle. It's like a muscle that you train over the course of a couple years, and it's something you have to practice frequently to keep. I noticed that I have a bit more anxiety when I haven't been meditating.

Just like I noticed I start to lose muscles when I haven't been working out. Whenever I'm in a bad mood or feel uncertain about something, meditation helps bring me back to myself. It helped me realize that a lot of my problems aren't actually that big of a deal that yeah, I have a lot going on, but no matter what everything is going to be alright

I started to feel more confident throughout the day. And I started to notice a sense of calm in my conversations with people. I could hold eye contact way longer.

All the times I saw people preaching the benefits of meditation, now started to make sense to me, when not too long ago it seemed like a complete waste of time.

I really started to amp up the meditations during quarantine. I was bored and I had so much free time that a routine was essential. 20 minutes a day, every day. This is when I had one of the most amazing experiences. It was eight months after my last breakup.

It wasn't until eight months later, when COVID happened that I actually dealt with what was going on. You see, I think that's what meditation does. It forces you to confront your own mind.

So one morning I'm meditating and I feel a deep sense of peace. Come over me. This happens like once or twice a month, you get a euphoria that is unexplainable. You just feel so damn good from nothing after the meditation.

And out of no where all the sad feelings from the break up resurfaced, and I started bawling. This was the first time I had really let myself feel sad about it, but afterwards it felt like a hundred pounds had been lifted from my shoulders.

I attribute this to meditation because I don't think those emotions would've surfaced. And I would've been able to let them go if I didn't have the space in my mind to do it.

And that made me realize as human beings, we hold onto things way longer than we think. And we leave them bottled up inside.

It's time to figure out who you truly are to take a step back from all the things going on in the world, because ultimately all your goals, everything you have and everything, you know, will be gone.

And the one thing you want to have figured out before your life ends is your self."

365,Anxiety,can stress really trigger a full body nervous system issue ?,"A few months ago, I was working out and hurt my back a little. (I have a history of sciatica, a microdiscetomy and chronic pain/herniated discs).. I'm 25. Anyway - proceeding this and potentially along side other life stressors - my body, my entire body from my face to my feet were having nerve pain? Misfiring? Tingling? .. this induced insomnia as I was terrified of going back into an acute flare of sciatic pain, and panick attacks (according to a counsellor I saw). This went on for about 2 months. I had MRIs completed, bloods etc and they all came back clear. The doctor then suggested an antidepressant and also is used for neutopathic pain - it completely zonked me for days. I took myself off it, and magically... the nerve pain was gone. The doctor had mentioned as there was no physical cause, that it was all emotional/mental health driven. My question  is - has anyone else ever had this?"
366,Anxiety,Anxiety over false asbestos exposure scare,"Back in October 2020, I helped a handy man gut out a Sunday school room, as part of a church hall. I broke up old ceiling tiles and fibreglass insulation and took it all out the back to into a tip. 

Fast forward to late January 2021 and I was doing some online learning, specifically health and safety. My tutor explained that’s there’s stuff in old building materials that, if you inhale the dust from said materials, it can give you cancer later in life, namely asbestos. 

I was in shock and horror after I found this out, as my mind raced back to the day in the church hall. 

I spoke to the man who I worked with. He doesn’t work with the stuff, and never would. The man I worked with, spoke with someone from the church who said there was no asbestos in the room we worked in. I also contacted someone from the church who said the entire church hall had been tested and came back safe. 

Despite all this reassurance, I still can’t shake this anxiety that they might be all wrong. 

It is bothering me, and given this is an anxiety subreddit, I felt it was appropriate to write this here. 

Thanks"
367,Anxiety,How can I stop worrying about my dumb 'rating' at my shitty job?,"i deliver groceries for an app for work rn cause i'm in school and it's decent

but because it's the modern gig economy hellscape, the way they evaluate you is letting customers rate how you did. it's a bullshit system cause you can't really control a lot of it -- like what orders you take, how well stocked stores are, them being dumbasses, etc. it's also a bullshit system because anything less than 5 stars is considered failure. out of 5. 

your average rating determines, overall, if you get fired or not if it gets too low. they've also decided that if it goes below 4.7 out of 5 (4.7, the number which is basically 5) you basically get worse jobs to do. 

it always fluctuates up and down because there's no real way to control it. the subs about it are toxic af because some people totally buy into it. 

it never really truly affects my income - i have the concrete numbers to look at and it truly doesn't.

it just makes me feel shitty about myself despite actively trying to not care. 

how can i stop caring?"
368,Anxiety,I am afraid I might be losing my mind from anxiety,"Please forgive my long post. 

&amp;#x200B;

**--history--**

Jan 1st 2020, after a few days of missing sleep and some stressful event. I started having these random panic attack throughout the day, prior to that I was a very chill person never had any anxiety issue or any health issue. For that week I started eating well, allocated 10 hours just for sleeping, and continue to exercise well. After a week the panic attack was gone, just some residue, but that slowly faded away too.

However ever since then, whenever I lack sleep for some times I would get a day where I have 1 - 2 anxiety rush (this happened rarely, maybe once every 5 months), and since the 2020 incident I learnt to control these rush, and they usually disappear within seconds.

(Anxiety rush: I feel it in my heart, my mind and hair on my body. Then the mind try to make sense of it by filling in the gap. When it is really strong, I usually run around to help the mind make sense of it,  it works well)

&amp;#x200B;

Since April 2020 , I started having a lot of health issue, developed some chronic issue, I still do and it's stresses me out to no end. I use to swim prior to Covid, but pool closes, so my only coping mechanisms was gone. However anxiety was never an issue, I was just stressed most of the time, to a point where I went from not a single gray hair to have people notice I have gray hairs.

&amp;#x200B;

**--turning point--**

Feb 2022, my chronic health issue gotten really bad, I started reading ""full catastrophe living"", really got into mindfulness, did it for a 3-4 months, got my chronic illness under control for the first time and calmed down my rushed mind. I stopped mindfulness afterward, because pool opened up and I went back to my swimming routine, and that made my chronic illness even better. **Life was going really well.**

&amp;#x200B;

**--Few bumps along the way--**

Afterward this year I had 3 incident where I took a nap and woke up feeling depressed and anxious (not the anxiety rush but just anxious all around), it normally goes away completely after I finish my swimming routine.

In June 2022 I heard marijuana might help with my stomach issue, tried it worked well first few times

June 19th 2022 - I overdose on marijuana, and for a week I was exactly how I was back in 2020 Jan, except I know how to control the panic attack, it also lasted for a week only, so it was very manageable.

&amp;#x200B;

**--my nightmare begins--**

July 7 2022 is when my real nightmare started. I took some med for my stomach health issue (pepcid), after a week I started feeling anxious for no reason (not the anxiety rush, but just anxious throughout the day. I quit the med but I am still getting the anxious feeling from time to time. My stomach issue also became worse than ever. I am not sleeping well

&amp;#x200B;

It's been a week and a half since I quit the med, my current state:

I get anxious about being anxious. I rarely get those anxiety rush, just a low grade anxiety but it's worse because this kind stay with me for a long time, while the anxiety rush would go away after the peek.

I am sleeping really poorly too because of my stomach health issue, I sometimes get woken up in the morning with racing heart too, but I am able to control it before it turn into a panic attack, and it doesn't make me jump up, I would just try to go back to sleep, usually fail though, but the poor sleep isnt helping my anxious feeling.

&amp;#x200B;

My concern is I feel like I am losing my mind, was so scared earlier. It got a bit better after I finally typed this out. I don't know if I will ever return back to ""normal"". The few incidents where I get this constant low grade anxious feeling is the worse. And I think I was scarred from it, because now I am anxious about that. 

I feel like it can be distracted though, so at least maybe it's not a physical/body chemical thing?? I am looking for a psychologist now.

I think I need encouragement/hug, and maybe someone to tell me it's going to be ok if that's possible and you mean it. Some advice would help too if that's ok.

I'm very pale so they were already visible to a degree, but the color is much more prominent. They're not darker, just... blue-er. Lol. Particularly in my wrists, hands, feet and chest. I'm always hydrated and due to health anxiety I'm afraid to look up reasons for visible veins. Are visible veins a side effect of beta blockers?

I was in this restaurant, and not knowingly I pushed my hands to this chair (chair in the middle) to get up to pay the bill.

I didn't feel a poke or prick. I went out after I payed the bill. Then I realized what if there was a needle on that chair. When I came back approximately 50 seconds later, they already bussed the table clean.

The problem is that it was not somnambulism because a part of me knew I was in bed and that my mind was messing with me, so because of that, I started panicking even more because I thought I was going crazy, resulting in even more panic and even shaking/weak legs.

I obviously struggled to sleep after that because it felt like I was losing it and going crazy. I finally managed to sleep but now this morning I'm still feeling really anxious because I'm scared that my mind starts doing that again and that I might go crazy.

Me and my partner have been planning a trip to Texas to see his family for months now. However, we didn’t have enough for airplane tickets, so we settled on a road trip. The reason I have no idea how or want to go about telling my parents is because they freak out over anything I do with the car. Accidentally leave the car messy?

Me and my partner work almost over 40 hours a week each. Excuse us for not keeping our car spotless or running perfectly. We hardly have time to do anything we actually want to do in our schedules. But we always make sure to get gas, and take care of any problems that appear as soon and as best we can. But nothing is ever enough for them. They also constantly be little my boyfriend and act like he can’t do anything, even though he drives more out of the two of us, is a mechanic, a cook, an editor, and the list goes on. They know we’ve driven an hour away before, but I just know they are going to freak out the moment I tell them we’re going across multiple state lines with a car they barely even trust me with. I can’t stop stressing about it, and the date for the trip keeps getting closer. I’ve been so anxious over this entire trip and planning and having to deal with my family.

382,Anxiety,Wanted to give a reminder and say thanks. Don’t go off your meds without talking to your doc and having a plan. I went off my meds and am now suffering to get back on them. Just waiting for the Prozac to kick in.,"Hello everyone. 
First off I wanted to say thank you to everyone on this sub. I’ve been reading through this all morning and just knowing there are so many people out there feeling the same thing as I definitely helps me not feel like such a weirdo. 

I’ve got GAD, depression, with some ocd mixed in there. At least that’s what my dr. Has said. I personally think it’s more that I have GAD and everything else is a symptom. 

The GAD makes me double and triple check things to try and prevent the anxious questions later about whether I locked the door, turned the coffee maker off, unplugged the iron. 

The fact that I’m always anxious makes me hate myself and wonder why I’m like this. Which of course leads to the depression/self loathing. 

Recently I decided to try and taper down my meds. I’ve was on a pretty high dose of Prozac and brought it down to twenty. Bought I was doing ok so I started to taper off. Then the full blown panic attacks started. 
Now I’m pretty sure I’m going to have to take the rest of the week off and sit on the couch trying to ride out these waves of adrenaline coursing through my body. 

I went to the urgent clinic yesterday and they gave me some Xanax. Which has definitely improved things. I’m no longer alternating between manically pacing the house, trying to not scream/cry on the couch, or shitting myself. 

Luckily I’m in a position in my life where I can take some time to get back to baseline. 

One piece of advice I wanted to give was how I explained it to my SO. She had a hard time understanding the issue. I’m ex military and she knows I’ve been in some high stress situations. But the anxiety developed well after my enlistment. How I think I finally explained it to her was it’s almost like my body/mind seem addicted to the adrenaline flight/fight response. So it just floods my system all the time every day. But there’s no reason for it. So I begin searching my memories for something I might have screwed up or not done absolutely perfectly to justify the feeling. Then if I find something that might’ve been incorrect I focus on it forever or until I can verify it’s correct. (Weird writing this as I can feel myself trying to think of an example. But also not think of an example so I don’t work myself up.) I think that really helped her understand it. 
Anyway. Thanks for listening to my rambling and thanks for all your posts and advice. It’s so very comforting knowing I’m not alone in this."
383,Anxiety,It wasn't my fault,"I feel so relieved right now I could cry.

I ran out of my meds 2 weeks ago and went to get a refill. My pharmacy said I had none left. But I could have sworn I had just gotten a new prescription. I questioned myself, is my sense of time that distorted? Am I crazy?

Cue 2 weeks of absolute hell from withdrawal in the middle of a move and a new puppy. 

I was beating myself up so hard. I fucked up. I failed. I caused this. It was all my fault. 

Doc has been on vacation so getting in contact and getting this all sorted has been at a standstill until today. Turns out, I didn't fuck up. I had just seen my doc and gotten a new prescription like I had thought, but there was an issue with it getting from the doc's office to the pharmacy. I should have refills until December.

I didn't cause this. It wasn't my fault. I was carrying all this guilt and shame and it feels like an enormous weight has been lifted. Plus, I'm finally getting my meds. I don't have the words express just how relieved I am."

So I grew up being taught the beliefs that mental health is not real (military parent) but the more I am on my own I see how it is. The question I have is I don’t really understand what anxiety is. I have been diagnosed with pretty extreme adhd but I am starting to wonder if I have anxiety. There are very consistent times that I think there is someone behind or watching me or whatever that just like freezes me in fear. I also overthinking to the point where it is unhealthy. I can only think about worst case scenarios in all aspects of life. I feel like I live my life in a constant state of “what if”. Does it sound like I need to talk to a medical professional about anxiety or is my dad right and I just need to man up. No hate if that’s the case then that’s the case."

I’m fairly well but I have frequent panic attacks when I struggle at something and I think It’s stemming from the trauma I’ve experienced during school as a kid (teachers were racist towards me and me think I’m stupid) so that really screwed up with me until recently I decided to travel to study and learn about orthopedics but I don’t know why I keep panicking despite me being comfortable with the choice I made."

I just came back from one on Sunday. Now my wife’s family is coming over from today until Saturday and I pretty much hate my wife’s brother. All of this is making me feel alienated and driving my anxiety through the roof. 

On top of this I’m busy at work and now just sick and tired of so much socializing. I have no idea what to do."
387,Anxiety,Exam Results Anxiety,"(Tw?)

Hi everyone, how do you deal with knowing exam results will be released soon.

I already know I have a problem of attaching my worth to exams. I am aware of this but can’t stop it.

I couldn’t sleep last night, I was shivering (even though it was a warm night). My hands were shaking. I was binge eating.

Today - I can’t eat. I can’t move. I couldn’t focus at work. 

Results are released tomorrow but I feel like I can’t move from this one spot of the sofa (also found it hard to get out of bed this morning) until then. 

Any help or advice would be appreciated.

P.s. I have been on Sertraline for 6 months.

Thank you."
388,Anxiety,Does anyone else have seemingly allergic reactions after a day with more stress than usual?,"I’ve noticed that on days when I’m really anxious and high-strung that I feel tingling at the back of my mouth, it feels like my body is buzzing/vibrating, my nose closes up, and although I’m actually breathing just fine through my mouth, I get overwhelming anxiety sensations in my chest. They feel like allergy attacks, even close to anaphylaxis without any hives or actual visible swelling.

Usually happens 1-3 hours after eating on high stress days.

Anyone else?"
389,Anxiety,Reaching a breaking point,"So I’ve been back on my Zoloft for going into my 3rd week.. and it’s going bad right now… in the second week I was feeling better.. but now I just feel like I’m loosing… my anxiety is so high… I feel so clouded.. my neck feels like I have a bowling ball attached to it.. I feel like something wrong in my head… my sleep
Has been shotty.. I have sleep apnea.. but I haven’t used my machine in a long time… last night wile falling asleep.. I had my Pulse ox on and it read 88%.. so I know that’s an issue… I’m so emotionally and physically drained right now.."
390,Anxiety,"Had to go to the courthouse for Jury Summons, and felt like I had a panic attack every step of the way.","I missed Jury Summons twice because I was afraid to even open the letter. Now I had to physically go to the courthouse. 

I hate driving when I don't know where I'm going, court opens at 8 am, I live 12 minutes away, so naturally, I left at 7:00AM. Missed my exit, had to drive around in loops. Got really freaked out on the one ways so pulled over to a side street to re-orientate myself and calm down. Realized I was on the wrong side, had to do 3 more loops to find parking. The lot only takes cash, I don't carry cash, had to find street parking. Heart is just pounding in my ears. Brain is not functioning like a normal freaking person. 

Once I finally did find parking, I was still unsure I was in the right place. Paid for 2 hours time because I had no idea how long I would be there. Sat in my car for like 10 minutes to breathe and chill out. Felt like everyone was staring at me and thinking I was stupid and crazy. 

Walked up to the courthouse, security tells me,  ""read the sign, it's not 8 yet, get in line"". Go to the back of the line. I'm practically shaking at this point. Another security guy asked if I was a juror, said ""you're not supposed to wait in line, you need to go in. Where's your paper?"" My heart is just going nuts while I'm digging through my bag. 

Welp. I forgot the stupid paper. Panic rises even more. He tells me good luck with that. I go in, check in, get a little turned around but make it to the 12th floor. Get in line. Get called up. Face is beet red and I'm sure I look insane. 

""No Jury service today Ma'am, we don't have any active cases. Dismissed. You're good until 2024."" 

Hands me a paper and boots me. 

All that unnecessary, irrational panic, for a 2 minute conversation. 

I hate anxiety."
391,Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"I am trying to find out if what I have is clear cut anxiety, or possibly something else.

I have no feeling of concern or worry when going out or attending social events, as rare as they may be these days.
Mentally I am 100% ready to head out to get things done.

Eager to get things done, due to how annoying this problem is.

However, nearly every time I get ready to leave the house I start to sweat…to the point where I can no longer leave the house and have to change my clothes/jump in the shower.

It is this physiological affect, turning red and dripping with sweat, that then leads to anxiety.
Due to obviously not wanting to be in public sweating like a boiled ham. 
However prior to getting my shoes on and stepping past my front door there is no sign of anxiety or concern about being in public.

It isn’t a heat thing either.

It seems clear it must be a subconscious mental condition.
But is it just anxiety?.
Does it manifest in a way that only presents itself without myself even being aware I have anxiety?.


Also if it is, are their any tips to make this less of a problem?."
392,Anxiety,"Does anyone else sometimes find comfort in knowing this all comes to an end, for everyone? Might be a trigger for some so be warned.","So basically, anxiety has taken a huge role in my life and used to totally control it. I’d be fretting about whatever it was day in and day out. Eventually, after a particularly bad attack, I kind of had a long introspection about myself and realized everyone, no matter what choices they make, doesn’t make it off earth alive. I know it sounds obvious, but for me it was somewhat eye opening that no matter what I do, it’ll end the same way as everyone else. Now when an attack happens, and believe me it still does, it is almost a sobering prayer to acknowledge my own fleeting mortality. I’m kinda posting this to ask if you guys think this is healthy because at glance it could be taken wrong."
393,Anxiety,(27F) Feeling helpless not being able to help my friend (30F),"Hello!

I am currently having anxiety (wanting to tear up) in regards to my roommate/friend. I have had this type of anxiety previously with this situation and I just want suggestions or advice to help reduce it.

Basically she's not doing good, is sad/depressed and doesn't want to talk about it. I think I've  done all I can, make sure she has resources available if needed (eg. distress center line, offering to drive her anywhere if needed). 

I had some catastrophizing assuming everything is my fault she has reassured me it's not and it's personal, but I still feel so helpless not being able to help someone especially someone who is not doing good that's so close physically. She is my first roommate apart from my common-law partner. 

It's hard not to be anxious when someone around me is not doing good. 

I also wanna reduce my anxiety to not add on to her stress/problems because she feels bad for making me worry. Which I have said not to be sorry, I just care."
394,Anxiety,Irregual heart beat,"So I just got out er.  I'll be earing a heart monitor for 72 hours soon but doctors arent concerned.  Ecg showed an early beat but otherwise a regural symetrical pulse etc.

It started with me measuring my blood pressure this morning that showed irregural heartbeat.  I've had that before but I always did 40 more takes and couldn't duplicate it so I wrote it off.

I had a medical a few weeks ago dr said my heart sounds fine 

Now I'm home freaking out.  I have terrible health anxiety and hypochondria so this is a nightmare 

Every time I take my blood pressure it shows irregual heartbeat symbol.  I can't stop thinking about it.  My daughter wants to play with daddy but I'm feeling in a constant state of panic ( probably why my heartbeat is irregual....)  I don't know how to stop."
395,Anxiety,"does anyone else feel a generally increased anxiety, lack of appetite and heavy/fatigued legs in the days after an anxiety/panic attack?","My level of anxiety is still much higher than it was before the attack.

398,Anxiety,How do I deal with relationship anxiety over my ex-girlfriend’s coworker who is pursuing her while we are trying to get back together?," **Background:** My ex and I were together for 4 years (last 2 years long-distance) and broke up seven months ago due to her severe depression and general issues with long-distance – her decision. She hates her life in her new city – she struggles with seasonal depression, doesn't have any friends, hates her job, etc. I recently had an opportunity to move near her. Since then, we have rekindled our relationship without the burdens of long-distance. She spends every day with me, helped me move in, has told her family/friends about me being back in her life, we've planned a two-week vacation, etc. We haven't put a label back on our relationship though because she wants to take it slow. Her reasoning for wanting to avoid labels for now is because she wants to fix a lot of her life that she feels dissatisfied by – going to therapy, working out, addressing long-neglected health issues, making other friends, cooking more, etc. Her depression robs her of functional hours she can do these things with, so she wants to still spend time with me in a way that makes her feel like she can still ""prioritize herself”

**Coworker:** After we broke up, a new coworker joined her office who was also new to the city. It’s clear that this guy is interested in her. They work for an airline so employees often travel together on weekends. He invites her to travel internationally with him alone every weekend, has asked her to work remotely with him for multiple weeks, texts her constantly, makes weird sexual comments to her, and I’ve noticed him making subtle back-hand comments about me to her that she didn’t pick up on.

I think she just genuinely appreciated having a friend here because of her loneliness, but there are a few things that make me feel a bit uncomfortable:

* She usually turns down his invitations to travel abroad, but she agreed to go on a week-long trip with him and a few coworkers, including other girls.
* She’s a pretty dry texter, tends to take a while to respond to me, doesn’t like long text conversations, and we don’t really update each other over text. She texts him frequently though, more enthusiastically, and they update each other on their days. My sister who knows her pretty well thinks she just texts this guy more because: (1) He’s new to her and less familiar, so she is putting on more of a “face” while texting him that she doesn’t have to do with me; (2) they almost entirely communicate over text while we see each other in person and FaceTime regularly; and (3) he was more present in her life until I moved here, so she would naturally text him more than me.
* Before I moved here, she invited him a couple of times to events that could definitely be conceived as dates – she told me she invited him because he was always available and she didn’t want to go alone. She also texted me afterward to tell me about the events and said she wished I was there.
* Her friends knew she had broken up with me, so when she started spending time with him, they thought she was flirting with him and was interested and made jokes about them getting together
* He understands her dissatisfaction with her job better than me, and I think I am a bit insecure because it seems like this is how every “emotional affair with coworker” story starts.

I haven’t necessarily spoken up about my discomfort, but she knows me well and can read my expression when she brings him up. I think to her credit, she has gone out of her way to give me assurances even though we aren’t officially together.

* She has explicitly told me that I have nothing to worry about with him, she just appreciates having a friend who is always down, but that she obviously chooses me over him and she’s not even sure if she genuinely likes him as a person or if they are friends out of convenience. That last part makes me feel weird, because she clearly enjoys talking to him and I don’t like that she’s downplaying her relationship with him to me.
* She talks shit about him a lot to me – but sometimes I feel like she uses that as a vehicle to talk about him with me in a less alarming way.
* She even went so far as to bring up his Instagram page to show me pictures of him so that I could see “that I have nothing to worry about” - I think the implication there was that he was unattractive.
* She also will unprompted tell me what they were texting about if I’m with her and he texts her – I have never asked her to do this and don’t ask questions, I think she just wants to make it clear to me that there isn’t anything there.
* She vented to me about how she hates that everyone assumes she is flirting/interested in him because they spend time together – she said even if he has feelings for her, she hates that she can’t just have a friend.

I have always been a trusting partner, and I try to be very clear that I support her being friends with this guy and don’t want her to feel uncomfortable about it. It’s not that I don’t trust her, but I don’t trust him at all (which is a first for me with any of her friends). But I don’t think I can express this to her while we aren’t together officially, and I don’t want her to feel like she has to lose the only friend she has to be with me – which is not my intention at all.

I’d just love any advice to clear my head about this – I know it’s something that I need to work on to fix my anxious attachment, and I’ve never been a jealous person but I do really feel concerned about him."
399,Anxiety,Has anyone here experienced dpdr?,
400,Anxiety,I'm unwell and struggling to function,"I'm a long time GAD and health anxiety sufferer. I'm pretty sure I have somatic symptom disorder. 

I recently caught covid while working (as a university instructor). I'm fully vaccinated/boosted so it was basically like the flu for a couple days. While I was on the mend, I started googling long covid, etc. Stupid, I know - but anxiety makes you do self-destructive things.
Ever since I've had extremely bad anxiety. I feel like my muscles don't work correctly. They burn and feel weak when I try to do anything. Sometimes even when I'm just sitting there. I'm terrified of stuff like CFS and other permanent disorders. 

Aside from the physical symptoms, I am really struggling to do anything for myself. Any task feels totally overwhelming. I can't make myself food. I can't clean. Luckily, my summer class just ended so I'm not working and I have some time to re-orient myself. Funny enough, I always felt a little better towards the end of teaching. Like my physical symptoms weren't as bad after ambulating and talking a lot. This is why I'm fairly convinced it's psychosomatic. But that obviously doesn't make the symptoms go away. 

I try to engage in hobbies (video games, etc) but I get no joy in it because I'm so preoccupied with how I feel. I've been putting on silly or relaxing YouTube videos to try and lighten my mood but I really just kinda stare past the screen. Exercising exacerbates the physical, muscular symptoms which spikes my anxiety up bad.

 As of a few days ago my psych has upped my Prozac from 40 to 60mg and also prescribed Buspar 5mg 3x daily. I was given just ten doses of 1mg lorazepam but I'm cutting them all in half to try and ration. I seem to need them every day. In fact, I'd take them every 4 hours if I could. They help, but only mildly. That's how bad and persistent this is. 
Honestly all I actually WANT to do is zonk out on benzos, lay down, and sleep. 
I'm taking all sorts of anti anxiety supplements. Probably too much. I can't meditate/relax/watch asmr vids/etc. It's a mess. I'm a mess. 

My primary care doc has been running labs and all they've found is abnormally low sodium levels. Prolly because I over medicated with magnesium for 2 years for anxiety/headaches... Yeah, I'm like that. 

Im seriously at my wits end. I'm hoping so badly the med change kicks in and I can get back to normal before next semester... But I don't feel hopeful at all. 

Has anyone else been totally disabled by their anxiety/physical symptoms? Like nearly bedridden? How'd you get out of it? Has anyone else experienced this muscle fatigue from anxiety? It feels like that burning weakness you get when you're working out.

So sorry about all the disjointed thoughts. It's just kinda where I'm at right now.

Seeking solidarity and stories of success. 💙"
401,Anxiety,Anyone else get cold sensations on skin?,"Just another health-anxiety worrier. Lately after weeks of panic attacks and anxiety I’ve started getting cold and hot flashes during the night. It’s caused my arms to feel cold sensations.

I had to resuscitate her the first time it happened. I hate the word scared, but im scared of night now, and not really sure how to process anything anymore. I feel underwater a lot of the time.

Im just so scared for my future, part of me is worried that i wont make it out of the surgery but even if i do i have to get people to take care of me for a month while i heal.


And i still have to bury my dog which i keep putting off."

404,Anxiety,prozac increase - side effect?,"Hey, recently had a shit of a time going from 10 to 20mg of prozac morning anxiety that I couldn't shake till the afternoon or took a lorazepam. High intrusive thoughts telling me I'm going nuts or insane, internal tremors and random waves of doom and panic. No sleep, Got over it by week 4 had 3 days grace now gping up to 30mg..... but I'm doing in 5mg increments. I'm slowly getting these side effects again just less severe. Is this the pill? Or am I just going nuts?!

Thanks"
405,Anxiety,I'm not sure if this is anxiety,"I've dealt with anxiety for years, and have had many anxiety attacks however I experienced something very weird today and I'm looking for input.
On the couch, no triggers, I noticed my heart starting to speed up. I think it's odd but adjust my position to get more comfortable and try not to focus on it. Within a couple of minutes I can feel it in my face, I had hear it, I can feel it pounding when I place my hand on my chest. I measure it and it's at 150, other than doing cardio I never see it that high. I tell my husband ""I need to go to the ER, I'm having a heart attack"" he tells me to sit back and breathe deep. Maybe 20/30 minutes from me initially noticing my heart was pounding it's back to normal. 
Was this an anxiety attack? Or am I about to die (joking, kinda)? I had no other symptoms of an anxiety attack, and I've never experienced that before even during other anxiety attacks. I have been under a lot of stress, but this experience seemed very out of the ordinary."
406,Anxiety,my therapist said my level of anxiety before my job interview was normal,Lol I may not get the anxiety until the day before but I don't think it's normal to think of various ways I could  get put in the hospital to avoid doing the interview even though I really need to

408,Anxiety,How long does it take for propranolol to kick in?,"For GAD, social anxiety, and panic attacks I was prescribed 10mg lexapro daily and 10mg propranolol as needed. I was told to take it when I have a panic attack, or before stressful events to prevent one, but I wasn't told how long beforehand I should take it. The lexapro has helped me a ton but I hadn't tried the propranolol until tonight when I had a really mild panic attack and figured it was a good time to see how I react to it. I swear my heart rate started to slow and I felt less panicked within like 5-10 minutes, but everywhere I've looked says it takes an hour to work? Was it just placebo, or it ending on it's own?"

410,Anxiety,I feel stupid at my job,"I started a new job 6 months ago in a field I’ve been in for 8 years. At my old job I was comfortable; knew my shit and was head of my department.  It got to the point where I wasn’t learning anything new and raises were not given. So I got a job where my “friend” works. I am very anxious person. I hate screwing things up or over stepping. My mind races and I’m thinking about what’s next and forget stupid things. At my old job, I didn’t have that problem, but I was so used to everything. At my new job, I’ve learned a lot. I’m using new machines I have never used before, assisting in surgery and have to use three different computer systems plus help with reception stuff, which I hadn’t had to do before. It’s a lot to keep straight. I’ve picked up a lot but it’s been overwhelming. I feel like the doctors and coworkers think I’m stupid. I ask a lot of questions because I don’t want to mess up and I can tell it annoys them. But they do things so differently. And when I ask questions, I get mixed answers. The other day the doctor pulled me to the side and correct me on something I did wrong. I accepted it but was confused what exactly I did wrong. I looked back at the patients chart, and I was actually right. My friend, who helped me get the job has been a jerk. She basically hovers over me and waits for me to do something wrong, acts annoyed when I ask her for help or tries to tell me what I should be doing (she’s not my boss and has different job title). It makes me feel like I’m fucking up so bad. I feel like everyone thinks I don’t know what I’m doing, when I do know my job very well, just not how they do things. There’s so many things to do, and some of those things I’ve only done once because they aren’t often occurrences. On top of that I feel like I’m so slow. My coworkers fly through patients, I feel like I’m not necessarily slow but I make sure everything that is suppose to be check is done. It’s frustrating. It makes me want to quit, but the pay is good. It’s brought my self esteem way down. I feel like I can’t do anything right in my life right now and I’m a burden."
411,Anxiety,DAE have a hard time feeling like important people in your genuinely care about you - even though you know that they do/they have told you they do?,"This mindset I have has created issues in my past relationship and I have had situations with my closest and best friends where I have felt like this and I want to start to unpack it. It’s like I never want to assume my importance in someone’s life, even as far as if I am dating them. My ex-partner communicated to me that me saying things like - I know they don’t care or they wouldn’t care about certain things is kind of offensive and off putting, and I am aware that it can come off that way - but I woullike to start reframing this in my head. With friends, it’s at times when I want to express something I’m excited about and feel like they won’t care so I end up not saying anything. But I find it more of a prominent feeling when I’m with a serious partner, and I want to kind of figure out how to fix it. 

I’ve always just thought it’s me protecting myself,  from disappointment or being in a place that makes me look desperate(?), which I don’t think are bad things. But also thinking that is some kind of trauma response that I’ve adapted from when I was younger/a child but I’m not sure to what kind of situations?"

I hate it, it makes me feel like my friends and family hate me, iv gotten to the point to where I can recognize I was just anxious after the fact but I still become a very hard human being to deal with when I’m having a flair up. I think lm gonna consider taking meds, iv slowly gotten over my fear of taking meds. I’m hoping it just helps me, I hate the fear I feel all the time. I just wanna be able to care for people like a normal person, I just feel like I have been running everyones patients thin"
413,Anxiety,Thought of going somewhere remote aggravates my anxiety. How to manage it?,"I was diagnosed with GAD several months back and for now, I am able to live a sound life without any issues. I have been able to expose myself to my fears, but there are two aspects of my life that are still troubling me. First, whenever I hear certain music, I tend to feel anxious; second, a single thought of going somewhere, like in nature or hiking, a place were far from civilization makes me anxious. Because of this issue I have even canceled a lot of plans with my friends. One thing that I do know is that both of these issues are somehow rooted in my problem that something might happen to me when I am there. Do you guys ever felt the same? how did you overcome it?

Sorry for the wrong flair, if any."
414,Anxiety,how do you handle dissociation?,
415,Anxiety,How can I enjoy life knowing everything is bad for me?,"I feel like it’s impossible for me to enjoy anything now because I’m so scared of how unhealthy everything is. (I have health anxiety)

For example, I’m moving into a brand new house soon and all I can think about are the VOCs and the toxins. If this were 5 years ago I would’ve been SO excited, but now all I feel is dread.

Another example is food, I’m terrified of most food because they are all harmful in some way (pesticides, carcinogenic stuff, food borne illnesses)

I went to the beach today and I couldn’t help thinking that I’ll end up with skin cancer someday because of sun exposure. But I’d never wear a bunch of sunscreen because sunscreen is proven carcinogenic.

It just feels like there’s no way to be safe in this world!! But I already feel like I’m sick somehow with a lot of the physical issues I’ve had this past year and I don’t want to do anything to make it worse. It’s impossible to avoid bad stuff though.

Now I’m pregnant and I’m scared of overdoing or under doing certain supplements and vitamins. It’s all so overwhelming that I want to just crawl in a hole and never come out.

Does anyone struggle with these kinds of anxieties too? Mine are mostly health related, but the health anxiety sub is kinda difficult to post to.

Any tips to help my mental health would be so appreciated! I tried therapy and it was just okay."
416,Anxiety,My roommate is making me feel like shit,"I deal with very debilitating anxiety. Social anxiety is one. But also just random ass anxiety that comes from no where. It effects me physically to the point my arms get sore, my chest gets tight, my let’s get tingly. And of course all that feeds to my head which makes me freak out even more than before. “Am I having a heart attack?” Even though I know my mind made it all happen because I know the signs of heart attacks. 

I wake up some nights after crazy dreams having major anxiety attacks. I feel like at any moment I might drop dead. My mind is filled with existential dread that only goes stronger making me think the absolute worst. It sends this feeling through my whole body that I can’t even really explain. It’s like I’m just so uncomfortable, literally every muscle and limb. I feel this numb feeling, numbs a bad word but best I could come up with. I like to explain it as feeling this aura around my entire body that’s JUST touching my skin and it literally makes me go crazy. My mind is racing with terrible thoughts and no matter what I do, I can’t calm my self down. It feels eternal. 

Anyways. I was having an argument with my roommate and he told me I blame things on anxiety too much. “We all deal with anxiety, stop using it as an excuse”.  But someone that has never dealt with it to the extremes I have will never understand it. Nothing I say can make him comprehend how bad it is. How debilitating it can become. It’s just an excuse to him. But it’s literally my life every day. 

Here’s my question. How have y’all dealt with explaining or trying to get others who don’t completely understand it, and getting them to a point where they can finally sympathize and not hold it against me, but instead understand and sympathize and finally grasp that it’s worse than they could ever imagine?"

422,Anxiety,Only stranger/acquaintance I don’t have anxiety having small talk with,"There’s this old lady that always cleans the complex I live in I don’t know her name but she resembles my mom and she seems very sweet I’ve seen her a few times, today I walked passed and she said how’s your day and I was like im good how about you, she said my days been great honey enjoy your day, idk if it’s the fact that she looks like my mom but im comfortable making small talk with her or her positive attitude but whenever I see her and she makes the effort to want to know how’s my day going it brightens my day as someone who often is unnoticed by everyone"
423,Anxiety,Help for my daughter.,She’s on an ssri but I don’t think it’s effective.  She says she has a feeling of tightness in her throat that she says is anxiety.  I had no idea there was physical pain associated with anxiety that she feels just at rest/at home and not in an anxious situation.  She meditates a lot but nothing seems to help her.  Does anyone else experience this?
424,Anxiety,you ever just have anxiety when you're just fine?,
425,Anxiety,you ever just be in a great mood and then can't sleep cause of anxiety?,"Just- everything is going fine, sure super happy. You had a great day, you did your best time routine, turned off the phone, read a book, took some melatonin, got comfy, laid down, and felt you're self ready to sleep...

And then you realize that this entire time you had underlying anxiety causing your heart rate to go super fast and you've only just noticed right now now that you're holding still and unable to fall asleep despite being super tired I mean what the heck why is this even I thing I can't even freaking gosh heck darn it all ragver"
426,Anxiety,I always vomit/almost vomit before traveling,"It’s so frustrating, it doesn’t matter the form of transportation. Plane or car create the same reaction. I don’t really know what it’s a reaction to, I’m not really anxious about anything bad happening at all. It just feels very overstimulating and scary in the moment where I’m leaving home. I’m usually completely fine after the first few hours but even Klonopin has no effect on my physical reaction. I got on a flight last week and had to puke outside of the airport. I’d taken 1.5 mg of klonopin, it was my second time taking it so not a tolerance issue. I’m leaving on a huge trip Tuesday morning and i don’t want to have to deal with vomiting in front of all my friends. It’s so unnecessarily embarrassing. Idk what to do. Has anyone else had a similar experience and how did you deal with it?"
427,Anxiety,Extremely worried. Help.,[removed]
428,Anxiety,"Idk who needs to hear this, but if you work in a corporation, read the post.","Your corporation will always tell you a bad feedback. If you do something wrong, they'll let you know. They prioritize efficiency and productivity.

That being said. If you get ONE bad feedback, do no spiral into thinking you're a bad worker or that you might get fired. Do not bat an eyelid to that. Ofc, learn from your mistake, but don't do what I did, and that is thinking that I make _waaaaay more mistakes than I actually do_. They will tell you. No bad feedback means you're doing ok.

I worked in this company for a whole year and no one told me whether I was doing alright or not, but one day my manager told me I missed one of my reports. From that point everyday for one week I doubted every move and every task I completed. I started thinking I am on the edge of being fired too. 

A colleague told me during lunch break that the manager gives her bad feedback everyday and then I got liberated and realized the only feedback is bad feedback.

My case, ofc, I won't generalize, but if someone need to hear this, I hope it helped.

In general, do not pay too much attention to the corporative behavious, they do not pay attention to you either. Be efficient, do your work, earn your living, do not take personally what they say. They treat us like living labour meat either way.

Have a great day!"
429,Anxiety,My anxiety has kept me from having any friends.,"I wish I- I could hold an extended conversation with someone without feeling extreme levels of anxiety, I haven't had a proper friend in many years. I've even been trying to make friends online but, I'm not sure if it's working too well.

430,Anxiety,Fear of loosing everything,"So for the first time in my life I feel like I have it all. A good path for my career, a loving girlfriend (fiancé soon hopefully), and the best doggo in the world!

I’ve had ptsd and anxiety for about 7 years now and I’ve gone through therapy and medication for depression. The depression is gone. Now I’m left with anxiety that has me questioning everything all the time. 

Lately my biggest fears are losing everything. In an instant I could screw up at work, lose my girlfriend or dog, wreck my car, or die myself. 

This anxiety is obviously crippling at times, but I understand it’s also completely out of my control if something freak happens.

431,Anxiety,how do I recover when my anxiety seems to be getting worse?,"As the title suggests my anxiety just seems to be getting worse and worse. I have pretty bad health anxiety and my therapist and I are also convinced I have cardiophobia as well. Given that I'm always hyper alert to any pain my body experiences and anxiety itself causes pain I CANNOT stop being anxious at all hours of the day. As soon as wake up I have about 3 seconds to acknowledge my chest doesn't hurt then suddenly it is hurting. It takes me 4 hours of being awake before I feel comfortable even doing anything. I keep having anxiety attacks but am getting to where I can shut them down but only when I'm around someone I trust. I keep calling EMS just in case because I had one so bad in December that my heart rate shot up to 230bpm then it just stopped for about 5 seconds then restarted at a very slow rate causing me to go into shock and having to be rushed to the hospital. Once I see EMS and they confirm I'm ok it goes away but I can't keep doing that. I try to remain calm, breathing exercises, even grounding technics but until I'm around someone that could safely restart my heart or atleast perform CPR I'm fully convinced I'm about to die. It's getting so bad that it's affecting my dreams, not like I'm worried about it in my dreams but I'm just having different dreams in general about being remorseful of life choices and what not. How can I get this under control? How can I stop it from getting worse? How can I just regain normal life and not worry every second of every day if this is my last breath?"

436,Anxiety,Worried about anxiety nausea/need help redirecting thoughts,"Triggers: death, vomiting
Hi, 
In short: I am worried about throwing up, never being able to keep food down, and eventually dying because of that.
A couple of months ago my grandpa died, which was the first time I have witnessed something like that. I have an anxiety/panic disorder, which was definitely triggered by that. 
A week ago I threw up when trying to eat. I had covid and I was anxious at the time. I have not thrown up since, and have been eating a little bit better, but I’m just worried about it all day. Am I going to throw up again? If I throw up again, I might throw up next time, and what if that leads to my death?
I need some tips to maybe calm the nausea and the thought, because it’s all I can think about. I’m so anxious, I’m just trembling all day. Thanks in advance!"
437,Anxiety,Can i be sacked for having anxiety?,"I am a sufferer with anxiety, so i've come to the people of reddit to help me out.

I work in a Carehome (as kitchen staff) and on Saturday (25th June), the fire alarm went off which sets me off. I did what i've been told to do which was come out of the kitchen and wait outside my door as that's where the fire assembly point is - while i'm trembling, hard of breathing with tears streaming down my face (this is how it goes for me, its unpleasant) its a false alarm as a leak set it off. Ive gone outside into the garden to calm myself and returned back to my work.  


About 10ish mins of returning i've been told ''you can be sacked for that'' 

Its played on my mind since the member of staff said that too me, the management know i'm a sufferer of anxiety and they know i'm petrified of alarms (its why when they do a test alarm they pre-warn me) I don't want to loose my job as i love it here.

My boyfriend likes to go to a lot of parties and group hangouts to smoke weed with his friends. I usually stay at home because i get stressed out in such a large group of people. Recently he's been hanging out with more female friends, and they always seem to just smoke weed and stay up late hanging out.

While he's out with them, i always end up having anxiety attacks at home. He's staying over at a girls house tonight because he got too high and tired to drive and im scared to death. I dont think my fear is justified because my boyfriends never done anything to break my trust in the past, i just cant help but be scared my bf will find one of those girls to be better gf material than i am.

My boyfriend doesnt know i have these freakouts because im ashamed of my emotions. Ive tried to calm myself down by drawing, gaming, smoking, knitting, but nothing seems to work at stopping the shakes and bellyaches. What should i do to resolve this?"
441,Anxiety,Ruminating/anxiety about past mistakes/thinking you’re a bad person,I’m wondering if anyone is going through the same thing or has tips on how to stop this.. I’ve always been anxious but in the past few weeks I’ve been obsessing over small details of my past and bad experiences I had (especially while going out and drinking) and I’ve been really anxious about it even if months or years has passed.. For example I always feel the need to confess every guy I kissed in the past before I was with my boyfriend and while we were sleeping together but both agreed we weren’t serious. Now that we are serious I would not and have never cheated and he knows every single detail of my life and is totally okay with every single thing and doesn’t care but I still obsessed over the fact and I find myself overthinking when he sleeps that I’m a bad person or whatever.. this is just a small example because honestly every small mistake I’ve made in the past I obsess over and I’m so tired of it. I just wish I could not care like everybody else. sorry if this chaotic I’m currently writing this while having an anxiety attack  like usual (every night) but please help
442,Anxiety,I’m having an anxiety attack,"It’s been happening for over a week or two. Been having chest pain/tightness and increased heart rate. I get scared. I feel like it’s going to kill me. I can’t calm down no matter what, as it’s a physical thing."
443,Anxiety,woke up in the middle of the night terrible anxious,"woke up in the middle of the night terribly anxious

hi its currently 2am here for me and i been rudely woken up by my anxiety. (i would like to preface that i am someone who has overcome an anxiety and panic attack disorder in the past when i was a lot younger so this isnt something new for me)
but anyway, i thought writing it out to get my mind off of this terrible attack and just have someone to talk to could help.

currently 2 family members of mine are sick with covid and i struggle heavily with health anxiety and i would label myself a germaphobe. it has been absolute hell for me this past week trying to keep things in order around the house, wiping things down constantly, trying to diligently keep my mask on whenever they are around, cooking for them, cleaning their rooms, constantly scrubbing my hands, etc… you get it. no other sickness has taken such a toll on my family like this and it is so utterly overwhelming.
i know its not their fault that they’re sick and i cant hire some sort of nurse to come over here and help them while i go run away. i just have the worst fear of catching covid even though i really been trying my best to keep everything absolutely spotless and only approach them from up close (with both our masks on) if i have to. im not sure if this is some sort of OCD thing or what but my god i just cant take it anymore.
ive really been holding it together for the last couple days and by the greatness of god i have not felt any symptoms only up until yesterday i got a terribly dry cough due to the amount of disinfectant sprays ive been spraying all over my room. i believe they irritated my throat pretty bad.
anyway, sorry for the rambling but i dont really have anyone to come to to vent about this and ive suppressed my feelings enough where i think it’s all just starting to crumble on top of me right now.
i cant stop my nervous shakes and my whole body feels like it’s giving up. my heart wont stop racing and i just cant come up with a single reason in the world to calm myself down :("
444,Anxiety,Does anyone else experience Anxiety symptoms like this?,"First time posting here so sorry if this isn't allowed. I've developed anxiety over the past year or two, starting from weed is what I believe. Getting ""too high"" and eventually experiencing anxiety when I'm not smoking. Over time it got worse and worse until finally I saw a doctor and was prescribed ""Lexapro"". It helped a lot until I ran out, been good with no panic attacks since my prescription ran out. But I've noticed I get this nausea feeling somewhat an end up just gagging out of no where but never actually vomiting? Was curious if anyone else has been through this and if it's from anxiety or being 1 month off of my Lexapro? or if maybe it's something I should see a doc about?"
445,Anxiety,Does 1 mg of Xanax make anyone else feel more anxiety?,"Second time taking Xanax to calm stomach muscle spasms. I took. 5 mg 3 nights ago, felt little effect. Tonjght I tried 1 mg and now am jittery and can't fall asleep. I honestly feel more like going to the gym and running except stomach hurts and I have had to stay off my knee due to some inflammation from overuse. 

Anyway.. Why I was prescribed Xanax.. 

I have a stomach issue a former Dr prescribed diazapam for as needed. It worked.. My actual Dr prescribed Xanax thinking  my stomach issue is anxiety related., and something about half life of Xanax compared to diazapam. But I was actually only taking half of what the other Dr prescribed to begin with, as needed when stomach issues came on (1 to 3 xs a month) and it worked fine. 

I definitely don't like the feeling of Xanax panic I am experiencing right now. 

Does anyone else feel more panic when taking Xanax for anxiety?

I will call Dr tomorrow and tell her it isn't helping. My stomach still hurts. And I still can't sleep."
446,Anxiety,Having a terrible time. Can’t shake my anxiety.,"Hi all. I have had anxiety for a long time. Recently it’s been really terrible. My dog died a month ago and since I haven’t been able to breathe or think. My grief is making my anxiety much worse. 
Today I was driving, or rather stopped at a red light. I heard a beep and then a car hit me from behind. Once the light turned green I went past the intersection where it was safe to pull over and got out my car.  
The people who hit me went to pull in behind me then took off. I got back in and followed them and pulled aside the very old lady in the passenger side. 
She rolled down her window and yelled “you reversed into me “ rolled up the window and they sped off. 
I was so upset and shaking I went to the nearest police station to report it. 
I now have worse anxiety than ever. Like I’m going to get in trouble I can’t stop shaking. 
I’m so sure they drove into me, I wasn’t in reverse but I’m starting to second guess. Surely if I reversed into them they would have pulled over?? I hate involving police and am paranoid I’m going to be arrested…. Although I’m pretty positive I didn’t do anything wrong. 
I can’t relax and can’t stop shaking. It’s been hours now. 
Does anyone have advice on stopping the over thinking and terrified feeling? 
Thank you for your time."

That was 3 hours ago. I've been awake for 5 hours, after only sleeping 5 tonight, and I have a whole day of work ahead of me. And it's Monday.

i'm so so worried about that “tooth infection” and i don't wanna have one because **i just saw somewhere in the internet that it can reach our brains. internet really drives us (hypochondriacs) nuts.** i can't calm myself down. idk what to do. we are not financially stable and i'm just a student so obviously i don't have money.

449,Anxiety,I Have Anxiety About Sleep,"Hello fellow anxiety sufferers.

I have generalized anxiety but when it comes to sleep I am often unable to sleep. I haven’t been able to sleep the past week and I can’t take it any longer! I just worry so much about big things, small things, the past, the future, the present. Anything and everything. It’s like I can’t get my brain to just stop thinking and bringing up so many thoughts at once. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice? I have a bedtime routine that I follow and it was helping f for a while but doesn’t seem to help as much as it was. Other than that I’m not really sure what to do, but I know I need to sleep desperately."
450,Anxiety,Can someone help me?,"Might be the wrong sub for this but my anxiety disorder leaves me questioning myself a lot and I can’t tell whether this is a good idea to do or if I should just quit no forward planning. 

Toxic work environment, one individual just constantly trying to isolate me, can’t quite figure out why as she would rather rant about me to other people than say her problem with me. Anyways today I finally snapped and told her to leave me alone because all she did was either scream at me or give me dirty looks and today she screamed in front of a customer because I dropped a fork. 🥲

My question is, how do I let my supervisor know that I plan on quitting? I want to give him a heads up as he’s always been lovely to me and I feel as though if I don’t, said coworker will put a spin on it. I just want to send him a quick message just to say “I’m sorry but I’m really struggling with some things going on at work, and don’t really think I’ll be staying very long. Just wanted to let you know so it doesn’t come as a surprise.” but not sure if that’s enough or too much. 

Funny thing is I can usually deal with a mean customer, fake smile, fake apology (if appropriate), resume task. But when your middle aged coworker is gossiping about you, a teenager, it starts to kick in a bit when you’re standing alone and she’s standing smirking at you with her favourite people (i.e., the people she’s decided to like this month, changes every month.) do I tell my supervisor she’s the reason I’m leaving? Do I tell him what’s going on but not name names? 

I’m just tired of the anxiety feeling of looking over and seeing her staring at me and laughing. I feel like a joke and have since the day I started and I’m over it. It’s not ending, it’s not stopping, she’s well and truly won the battle and I just want out. I hate anxiety but I also dislike her for being such an mean human being."

452,Anxiety,Scared of not having a girlfriend," So for starters, this is a throwaway.

I'm 16 (17 in a week) and I have never had a girlfriend. I'm in an almost all-male secondary school. I hugged a girl once two years ago and that was the last time I had physical contact with a girl other than my family.

And I was never really scared of not having a girlfriend because I knew that when you meet the right person you know it. But now without any reason, my mind decided that I'm going to be alone my whole life. I'm overthinking and being anxious about this for like two weeks. And I recently cried myself to sleep for the first time ever because of this.

If I meet anyone I don't know what to talk about, I don't know how to start a conversation without being annoying, creepy, or pushy.

I don't get it how can everybody gets a girlfriend even the worst of guys but every time I see a girl I try not to look at her to not make her uncomfortable.

I have ADHD but when I take my medicine it helps but as soon as I have pressure I fold. I, of course, notice anxiety in other parts of my life, I feel like I don't blank though, and when I mean blank it's like I'm not looking at the screen I'm not focused on the enemy or anything just very broad.

Certain people in my life give me so much anxiety and it has been a task for me to get out of the house without my body shaking in fear. I cannot concentrate on studying either and its painful that I cannot bring myself to do that; I end up doing nothing just mindless scrolls on social media and seeking instant gratification from a guy who is taken.

461,Anxiety,Anxiety,"Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I just need to get my heart out. Hopefully it can be done here. 

&amp;#x200B;

For several years now, I have been severely affected by anxiety and depression. I have been in contact with this briefly in my younger years, but did not really get into trouble with it.

&amp;#x200B;

I can tell you that for a number of years, I have been deep, very deep. I've had moments where I didn't even want to leave my room, where I didn't want to do anything. Moments where I wished I had a bad disease and at some point it would just be done. Really horrible. I never took any medication and never went to a doctor. I tried to crawl out of the valley on my own which I did reasonably well. Only sometimes I still suffer from memories or pain lapses. I then have bad dreams for a few days and find it hard to concentrate.

&amp;#x200B;

Being anxious and depressed is really awful. It affects the quality of life so much. My biggest fear is lying in my death bed later and thinking that I got so much more out of life. I have always been very motivated and sometimes set the bar abnormally high. I think a lot of the fears come from that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I read a lot. Books like Atomic Habits, Good vibes good life. Those books have helped me a lot. 

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the day, we really are a community. We help each other, share each other's stories and try to be there for each other. Never let this get lost! this is where people get to know each other, build friendships and get better.

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy your day!"
462,Anxiety,Often mixing up words/aphasia due to anxiety? Help,"Hello, so I'm 29 and was diagnosed with general and social anxiety as a teen. I took a low dose of citalopram for a while and kinda ""got over it"" when I became older.

I'm still an anxious person though and it has become much worse in the past year, mainly due to to work and family-related stress. Not taking any medication though.

I've been experiencing speech problems quite often.  It's especially frequent when I'm talking to someone I'm not 100% comfortable with (smalltalk with coworkers, my boss, talking in front of several people).
For example I'll want to say ""Those politicians make me upset too!"" and I'll studder ""Those piloti- uuh politicians...."". So far only one person has pointed it out,  others don't react to it. But it keeps happening. Or sometimes I'll want to say one word but in the last splitsecond my brains decides to use another synonym. I'd want to say shit but my brain decides on more a more polite ""damn"" instead and I end up almost saying a mix of it: shamn.

Has anyone else experienced this? :( I'd rather not take meds again though, because I felt like they made my speech slower in general..."

Primary Complaint: Brain fog, depression, slow thinking, disconnection, etc.

I just always feel like my brain is slow. It just feels blank when I try to use it for anything such as talking with people, talking to myself in my head, going through a problem and trying to find a solution for it, making decisions, etc. Even when I'm just by myself at home and not around people and experiencing depression and anxiety my brain feels slow. This makes me wonder how much of this is even due to depression. But maybe I have it so often and for so long the symptoms just continue. There's a lot of feelings I have and sometimes even ideas, but I can never figure out a way express/articulate it like everyone else around me. It's like the words just don't come to me. It's like the words are there but there is a fog which I can't see through. 

I also struggle with feeling disconnected from the physical world every day. Some moments are more noticeable than others, but I feel its always there. It just feels almost like I'm just watching a movie of my life, or even of someone else's life. Like there is a screen or filter between me and the objective reality around me in which I'm forced to live in and interact with. When people are having conversations around me, it just feels like I'm listening to it through some sort of filter, like listening to people talk in a podcast through a computer, or in a movie through a tv screen. My mind just feels removed from the world around. I feel like a zombie or robot living with no real purpose at all. Just moving in an automaticity and clockwork way. 

I feel depressed almost everyday. I'll wake up feeling okay or happy. Be depressed on the way to work. Feel even more depression accompanied with anxiety while working. Then finally feel relieved when coming back home from work. The cycle just repeats. Life feels meaningless like this tbh. If anyone's experienced anything similar please offer some help"

465,Anxiety,How to best support my wife with anxiety,"My wife has been struggling with anxiety for quite some time now. It manifests as general feelings of unease, hypochondria and occasional panic attacks. I have, of course, asked her how I can help her when she's in a bad place, but I wanted to ask here if anyone who suffers from anxiety themselves can share some thoughts about how one's partner can support them in the best possible way.

Thank you."
466,Anxiety,Worried I'll have a panic attack while driving on the highway in driver's ed,"Before last friday, I haven't had a panic attack for around 3 months, but for the past few days I have been having really bad panic attacks

In an hour I have to drive on a highway for the first time in a driver's ed class, and I don't really know what to do if I get a panic attack during it (especially because i'm not very experienced at all in driving

Sorry if this isn't the right place to post this

Thank you"
467,Anxiety,succesfully learning to live with my anxiety and depression (and you can too),"(skip to the bottom for the main points/advice and PLEASE try them, they are so easy to implement but make such a huge difference its baffling)

okay, so for me, suffering with super bad anxiety and depression, i was put on 50mg of sertraline whilst i waited for therapy (still waiting as time is 8-10 month on average). first couple weeks after the negative side effects dissapeared, i was on a massive massive high and basically cured. looking back in hindsight, it was probably mania. i kept thinking to myself, is this how life is supposed to be? it was flawless. then that feeling went away, and my anxiety slowly creeped up on me. depression had dissipated though and i was able to do things that i wasn't before. i could get out of bed in the morning, start going places and stop constantly dreading life and debating its point. then my depression came back after a few weeks, so i upped my dose to 100. same thing happened and i had a slightly manic couple of days, which i was so happy about, but when they passed, i became unhappy. i now realise that i became unhappy because dealing with addiction problems, i constantly craved the manic state, and the high. when i realised this and took a step back, knowing that it was unnatural and unrealistic to have every day, i found a bit more comfort in life. just like when i had my lower dose, my anxiety was still there, but because my depression was lifted, i was able to do things and make the effort to better myself. basically, sertraline took away my depression enough that i was able to help myself create healthy habits and do things that i was unable to before, which means that i can now look after myself. i think it's super important to realise for me at least, depression is a cycle = feeling unmotivated and not doing anything-&gt;depressed-&gt;feeling unmotivated and not doing anything etc etc. this is why i am grateful i was able to temporarily break the cycle. now i know that i no longer need to chase this fabricated high, and that i can create my own happiness. although it is not as intense and it never will be, that is okay, because now the negatives are not as intense too, and i no longer will have to go through not moving from bed for days, or not showering for even longer. it's about balance. i am now taking myself off of them because i feel like i am now in control of my own brain and life. whilst i initally felt that the sertraline was not working anymore, i now realise it has in fact worked perfectly. so this is my message to everyone to stick it out, and to not expect it to create instant happiness magically for you, but to instead put in the work and let it help and assist you in doing it yourself.

other things that very very much helped me:

\- the highly sensitive person by Elaine Aron = realising a lot of my anxiety was just overstimulation; i highly highly reccomend reading this

\- cutting out caffeine (mostly) or at least definitely not after 12pm or one cup a day (VERY very IMPORTANT)

\- cutting down time on overly stimulating apps like tiktok and replacing with stiller things like reading

\- when panicking/overstimulated, writing down my thoughts instead of just letting them spiral in my head

\- spending more time in nature and stillness

\- reducing alcohol and drugs (isn't as enjoyable on sertraline anyway)

\- thinking of myself from another person's perspective and giving them (me) advice and helping

\- gratitude, cliche but it actually works

\- looking inwards at the connection between anxiety and depression, and how one leads to another (for me anxiety leads to overthinking which leads to depression)

\- eating more whole foods and not junk crap (still working on this one)

\- excersise = tiring out my mind reduced the anxiety and energy that was put into negative thoughts

\- asking others for advice from their point of view, as my mind is very black and white and i cannot see my actions from another perspective

\- remembering when i have a bad time that it will pass and it isn't permanent; this is where gratitude comes into play as instead of thinking to myself that everything is bad and it will never get any better, reminding myself of all the good things that exist and that will return once this phase has passed

\- introspection in general

remember to never give up! it's hard, but it's totally worth it, and it is a lot easier than you think! i promise!"
468,Anxiety,Feel like I don’t even know my own body anymore,"So I’ve been having tightness in my chest for about 24 hrs now and my anxiety is telling me that if we don’t run to the ER we are going to die. I went to the doctor and he was like wellll to be safe here’s a referral to a cardiologist and I call and I have to wait 6months. Which made my anxiety worse bc I’m like so basically if I have a heart problem I spend 5000$ at a hospital or just like die- great. 

But the most frustrating thing of all is Idk if this tightness is more or not! Is it a cold? Mucus draining? Allergies? Because I slept weird? Because I’m stressed? Muscle strain? It’s like my own body is an enemy to me and I don’t even know what is normal and what is a real threat anymore. Like people say listen to your body or my doctor- if it feels worse go to the ER- I DONT KNOW! 

Like I know it’s not anxiety because it’s constant. It’s not a heart attack either bc it’s been over 24 hrs. But everything else- idk. Heart infection? Pericardial effusion? And all these things they’re like “you can’t tell on your own so go to the doctor or ER”

Im like Idk what you want me to do because I don’t know what is a risk and what isn’t! Like I’m scared maybe I’m noticing something early before it gets bad and now is the time to intervene but then I don’t know if it’s actually something bad or not.

I wish I could just put another person in my body and be like “yo on a scale of 1-10 how bad or concerning does this feel” bc I just don’t know anymore. 

Im scared and exhausted and sick to my stomach and convinced I’m dying and I’m not going to get help in time. 

I just feel like I’m a stranger in my own body and I know nothing and I just wanna cry."

But  what I'm not okay with is when I wake up late for work and can't seem to make a phone call to let them know I'm gonna be late. So I end up not going in. It's 1.20 pm , I haven't gone into work and no one knows why as I won't contact them.

Ive been anxious since before I entered years high school (I'm 25 - so for over 10 years its been severe now). I'm about to finish a graduate certificate program in August and I'll need to find a job by October, so I'm interested in trying anxiety medication because my anxiety has reached life-impacting levels since the pandemic and I have a hard time even leaving my house alone to run errands. At this point I feel medication is essential for my wellbeing and ability to thrive. 

How did you start the conversation with your doctor? Did you try alternative medications and options? What's been successful for you?

I can’t take beta-blockers and given the waiting lists it’ll probably be next year before I can get to therapy. I need help but the idea of taking antidepressants does feel a little daunting, especially given all the anecdotes on here.

481,Anxiety,Inexplicable anxiety,"Lately my anxiety is through the roof again! It completely paralyses me. At work I often seem to be frozen. And at home I can't relax.

The thing is, I can't identify any cause. I have so much to be thankful about. My work, my private life, wife, daughter, house, etc... It's all going so well. I don't drink any alcohol. Don't smoke. My health is fine and I don't take any medications that could cause it. I work out a lot, because it seems to be the only thing that calms me right now. I literally can't think of anything that I might be (subconsciously) worrying about. 

I even thought that it may be something medical, so I went to my GP. They did some blood tests, which all came out normal. 

This anxious feeling has been constantly present months now. It came and went before a few years back, and I'm still oblivious to what caused that too. I also don't know what I did to make it go away. 

It's like I'm in this chronic state of fight or flight. A constant feeling of impending doom. My heart is racing all day, as if I'm watching a horror movie. And I'm not interested in any of my hobbies.

Any tips? How do I handle this? I know quick fixes are not encouraged, but I could really use one. Even if it is just to be able to think straight again and enable me to search for a more long term solution."

I am tired of being a woman with rights getting stripped and knowing that my government doesn’t give a shit about women, and that so many men are fucking predators to women.

I am tired of being chronically ill/disabled where people don’t understand how difficult it is to do certain things or have even a part time job, or how shitty medical care gets the moment you are chronically ill. I am tired of how difficult it would even be to get on disability, and that even if I did, the tiny amount of money I am likely to get wouldn’t help me at all.

I am tired of being misunderstood as someone that is on the spectrum as an aromantic and asexual, and how people don’t seem to understand what “I don’t want to date people” means, or any other boundaries or lack of interests in certain things.

I am tired of having a mental illness that also makes things difficult to function or do certain things, and people’s advice is total shit.

I am tired and so stressed and overwhelmed, and I feel like it didn’t really hit me until now.

488,Anxiety,Extreme anxiety after collapsing in public.,"A few weeks ago I was on a train to work. Completely ordinary day and a journey I’ve made before. I walked 20 minutes to the station and was happy that the train was running a bit early so I would get to walk earlier. 

I stood on the train for 5 minutes (this is typical for the first half of the journey and as people get off you get a seat) and suddenly had a rush of nausea - nothing unusual but just felt sick. I thought I’d get off at the next stop but it passed in a minute or so, so I decided to take a seat that had become available and just carry on the journey. 

I remember sitting down looking out the window and then woke up in the recovery position on the train floor with about 10 people standing over me. I panicked and thought I’d fell so I asked a man to help me off. He explained that I’d lost consciousness for about 5 minutes and the train was being stopped and everyone was getting off. I then vomited into a bag someone gave me and had to take my shoes and socks off as I was sweating profusely. 

An ambulance then arrived and I was told I was at risk of my heart stopping as my pulse was too slow. I was genuinely feeling like I would die, I just couldn’t get enough breath in. I passed out again in the ambulance and the next thing I knew I was in A&amp;E with about 5 staff standing over me tipping the trolley I was in and hooking me up to various machines. Then I heard the nurse say “we’re taking you to resus don’t panic”. 

I just kept thinking “youre dying” and “your heart is going to stop”. I was genuinely so scared. 

After 6 hours I was deemed okay and left hospital. I was just wanting to get home so my family picked me up. I’ve been at my parents house since, dizzy and terrified of passing out again. I won’t go anywhere on my own. I’ve managed short walks but always with my parents. 

I don’t think anyone realised how frightening it was :( I’m 28 and just confined to my parents house. 

It’s horrible to think that life can so easily be compromised on your average day."

My parents keep telling me it's fine but my anxiety hasn't calmed down at all. It wasn't past it's best before date but it was still moldy, anyone know if it's okay to eat?

Adoption and fostering is the route we both want to go, it’s perfect for both of us.

Naturally, neither one of us wants kids yet - but that doesn’t mean we’re not sexually intimate with each other. He uses condoms every time. I’m on birth control. He’s talked about getting a vasectomy, etc.

…But now that Roe V Wade has happened, I’m afraid to be intimate with him. No matter how many precautions we take, the small part of my mind is worried about that what if situation. That if all the stars align perfectly… what if?

I almost feel as though I can’t be intimate with him again until he gets a vasectomy, which I’m sure he’s willing to do without a doubt. But… I don’t know when that would happen.

I’ve always been comforted by that small thought of IF something happened, god forbid, I could get an abortion. But now…

496,Anxiety,Stuck in a rut,"Ive always struggled with social anxiety and GAD as long as I can remember. Right before the pandemic I was going thru a break up with someone I was really in love with. I developed strong relationship OCD and started having panic attacks at work constantly. I felt miserable so I finally made an appointment with a psychiatrist to get on some meds. He put me on Prozac and it somehow made everything even worse. I could barely function and my intrusive thoughts were worse than ever before. He kept telling me to wait it out till the medicine took full effect. But after 8 weeks I had to go stay with my mom for a bit and wean off because it was to the point where I couldn't eat and was starting to lose a lot of weight. Right after this the pandemic started and my roommate/best friend got into a new relationship and basically moved out immediately. I felt so alone and isolated, signed up for an online therapy and self medicated constantly with weed. The therapy helped a bit but not as much as I had hoped so I switched therapists a few times. I started getting depressed because even though I was doing the exposures there was something inside that still felt miserable and I was still having a lot of panic attacks. I really like my current therapist and I see her weekly and have been doing the exposures that she assigns. There are still times tho when I feel horribly depressed and anxious and can barely even get out of bed. I'm so scared to try meds again because of how it went the first time but it feels like I'm trapped in this cycle and even with the therapy I don't see any way out.

I was at the ER yesterday and they said I’m fine. But, I noticed my leg looks different. The veins on my leg are showing and they’re blue and purple. I didn’t notice this before. I wouldn’t be concerned about it if my leg didn’t hurt, but it does. It doesn’t appear swollen and it doesn’t feel hot to the touch. But I’m still freaked out because now I’ve got a cough, it feels like there’s something in my throat, I feel short of breath and I’m scared this is a clot that’s now gone to my lungs. They didn’t test me for a clot at the hospital. Please don’t freak me out more with blood clot stories."
502,Anxiety,Anxious on therapy days?,I am wondering if anyone has a bad day on a day you have participated in a therapy season. Interested to hear if it is just me.
503,Anxiety,Should I look into getting a new job due to anxiety?,"Hi there :) I'm considering looking for another job after recently being hired at a target. I have some other pros and cons that aren't anxiety related, however my anxiety is a pretty big determining factor in my decision and I'm not sure if I'd be comfortable discussing it in a strictly work related sub-reddit, but please let me know if there's a better place to post this.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started at a target not too long ago in the clothing department. I thought it would be a great fit for me because I can work with inventory rather than people. Most of my previous jobs depended on direct customer interaction, and while I could do it, it became incredibly draining doing it for 8 hours a day, and almost unbearable if the customer became angry or if there was a problem that was out of my control.

&amp;#x200B;

One of my main issues with my new job is that sometimes I'm expected to drop what I'm doing and hop on the register if they need me (really anyone is able to volunteer, but sometimes you are told/expected to go up). Which wouldn't be so bad if I had had more than 2 hours of register training. I've worked registers before but of course every store is different. I was called to the register the other day to help out with a long line and I was a bit nervous because cashiers are expected to be fast. I was as fast as I could be even though I didn't feel like socializing and was nervous to socialize. I fumbled a bit trying to find produce codes and had to bother another cashier to help me get a security magnet off of an electronic, and I had to figure out how to ring up a promotional gift card for a guest. None of this would have been so bad if I had had more training, but every time something went wrong I felt myself get more anxious. The line was never-ending. The person who sent me to the register casually asked what I was still doing there after 30-40 minutes, and my trainer for the clothing dept. was upset about the long line too since it took away from our tasks (but wasn't upset at me). I was stressed and mildly irritated because it wasn't my fault that people kept joining the line and I was just doing as I was told. I am dreading being in this situation again.

&amp;#x200B;

Also people come up to me frequently asking about products in different departments and a lot of the time I tell them I'm new and I don't know about the product or where it would be, and luckily they don't blame me for this but it's still an awkward interaction. I guess the simple solution to this would be to learn the store better if I decided to stay. I guess what makes me anxious about the two situations I've listed so far is that I don't have any control over what's going on, it's a bit of a helpless situation and my anxiety just makes it more uncomfortable.

&amp;#x200B;

Other factors for me deciding to leave would be the hours I'm receiving and cost of travel. They're only giving me 25 hours a week when ideally I would work 35-40. Gas prices are terrible right now and I've been spending over $50/week just to get to work. For context I live in a rural area with few job opportunities; most jobs are in a city about 30 minutes away from me.

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately the places in my rural area are hiring for $2-3 less an hour than what I'm making now, except for one chain with two locations close to me. It's a gas station that also serves made-to-order food that's ordered on a tablet in the store or online (which is a win--no directly taking orders from customers). There's cashiers there as well but some stores are beginning to implement some self checkout stalls too. I've already put in applications at these two locations a few days ago but I'm wondering if it's worth trying to call them and ask if they've had a chance to review my application to see if I can get an interview. The position of course isn't garaunteed, but I'm wondering if I should continue on my job hunt in general or just settle for what I have.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm worried that more customer interaction and longer hours could be a bit more draining, but at least I would know everything about the store. It genuinely seems like a good company to work for so I'm not concerned about that, I'm worried about not liking the work itself, and regretting quitting my current job if I do get hired. I am leaning towards thinking that it's a job I'd be able to do if I was hired though.

&amp;#x200B;

Money is a big factor for me as well because I have a lot of expenses to cover. I could pay off my bills with my current job but I'd be making about $600 less than I'd want to a month; I just wouldn't be able to pay things off as fast. I'm also worried for the quality of my mental health if I push myself to work 40 hours a week, so I dunno :/

&amp;#x200B;

For further context, there are some tasks I am beginning to like with my current job, and my direct coworkers are all really nice and I'd feel bad leaving them (though it's not like I'd stay just for them). Also I am waiting for an appointment with a new psychiatrist in about two weeks. I'm currently not on medication and I'm looking forward to starting a new med because a lot of the time socializing at all is rough, although I've been getting used to it again \*slightly\* just from working every day.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to this might be obvious but I just wanted an outside perspective. Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you have a good day :)"
504,Anxiety,How do you guys deal with constant anxiety? Anyone else afraid to try medication to deal with it?,"I have really bad stress/anxiety. I'm freaking the fuck out right now because I start a job in 4 days and I've been getting more and more anxious the closer it gets. 

Part of it is this is my first job and it's increasingly difficult to accept that this is my life now, and that a 8-5 work life is how I will live for the next 40 years. 

Part of it is the job itself. It's an incredible offer, but it's with one of those ""inclusive"" companies, which makes me feel like it's probably going to more like ""forced inclusion"". Add in the fact that this is my first real job I've ever had, and I'm not doing so great. 

I get really, really anxious for big events like this (sometimes to the point where I just won't show up). I know I should see a doctor and get medication, but I'm honestly terrified of starting any meds and don't want anything that could mess me up even more. How the hell do you guys deal with this???"
505,Anxiety,I'm not going to go outside anymore.,"I'm done. There's no point anyway. People shouldn't have to interact with trash like me. Women shouldn't have to look at ugliness like mine. I'm tired of looks, tired of not fitting in, tired of being uncomfortable in my skin. I just can't do it anymore. If I had a way to reliably off myself, I'd be gone. Life isn't worth living alone."

507,Anxiety,Panicking but want to just sleep,"Okay so this is going to sound stupid… I’m (26f) having a bad panic attack right now because today I very slightly scratched my leg on something in an area with some rust; no biggy, check to see if I’m up to date on my tetanus shot. I’m not. Again, no biggy; called my doctor to see if they could squeeze me in today to get one. They could. Awesome! 

Yeah awesome except I am a crippling ball of anxiety when it comes to medications. I’ve had a tetanus shot before so I know it’s fine, but I am in serious freak out mode for no reason… I’m constantly thinking, “what if I have a reaction? What if this isn’t a normal feeling? What if this time I’m right and something is too late?”. 

I’m tired. 

It’s midnight and I just want to sleep. 

I’m tired of having these thoughts and constantly afraid of dying. I’m so over it and I am crying so much while panicking lol I feel pathetic. 

Thank you for reading all the way through if you did&lt;3"

Last time, my thrombocytes level were also a little bit higher, and I'm afraid they'll be even higher now :("
510,Anxiety,Non-SSRI meds for anxiety that worked for you?,"I need something. Ssri gave me anhedonia and pssd a year ago, so it's not an option. So far I have tried escitalopram, mirtazapine and bupropion. Both the escitalopram and bupropion gave me the worst sickness and anxiety. The kind of sickness, where you can't eat or drink at all, can't get up from bed and choke on your vomit when you try to sleep. It's awful. I tried to push through, but this is just way more than my fragile mental space can handle now. I've been on mirtazapine for a year, along with xanax. Mirta didn't give me sickness and helps a lot, but nearly not enough. I got addicted to xanax so I'm in the process of tapering, but it's hell. My anxiety and panic disorder are severe and constant. I have extreme agoraphobia and I can't go anywhere, since I'm tapering xanax, I can't return the lost progress. 


I feel like there is no medication that doesn't make me want to puke my brains out all day long, and helps with my anixety. Im about to give up, I have suffered so much, and it's only getting worse. In my country they don't give hydroxyzine or propranolol. I tried. Can anyone relate? What helped? Don't tell me meditation and exposure therapy, I already lost 3 years of my life to them, I can't waste any more."
511,Anxiety,Anxiety over turning off the stove,"I used to struggle with OCD a lot but it has subsided in recent years. I used to have a huge fear of accidentally burning down the house so I’d repeatedly check to make sure the stove was off, the lint trap was spotless, etc etc even when I knew they were alright I’d still have to check them. I had many other obsessive compulsions as well But as I said I have not struggled with it so much recently. Until today. 

I was at my boyfriends house making a grilled cheese earlier on his gas stove. I went home about an hour later as we both have to wake up early for work tomorrow. I was home for about an hour when all of a sudden a thought popped into my head: “what if I didn’t turn the stove off?” Followed by “if I didn’t turn the stove off, his whole house could burn down, he and his whole family could die and it would be my fault. Even if his house doesn’t burn down they could all get carbon monoxide poisoning because of me.” 

I called my boyfriend a billion times trying to wake him up to see if he could check the stove. But he must have had his phone on silent so he did not answer. I was on the verge of a full on panic attack.

Here is the thing. I do not drive, and the town I live in does not have any cabs or Ubers after 11pm. My boyfriends house is an hour walk away from mine. But I knew I would get absolutely no sleep if I didn’t know for sure that the stove was off. So, at 11:15pm, I walked an hour to my boyfriends house. Just to make sure the stove was off when I was pretty certain I did turn it off, but not 100%.

It was off, by the way. 

My boyfriend is a heavy sleeper so I went into his room and tried waking him up so that he knew I was here but I don’t think he fully woke up and he’s going to be confused af when he wakes up and I’m in his bed (I hope I don’t startle him lol) 

All in all I feel a bit pathetic for letting my anxiety win but I KNOWW that if I stayed home then I would probably be having an anxiety attack right now."
512,Anxiety,Every time I take a Lorazepam I feel like I failed myself,"25m, have recently been suffering from severe anxiety and near daily panic attacks over the last few months. 

I’m on 15mg of Mirtazapine that I take daily and it has reduced my frequency of panic attacks. It somehow allows me to feel when they’re coming and prevent myself from “going over the edge” I guess. However, there are other nights that I’m unable to calm myself down and take Lorazepam. 

I wasn’t even prescribed the Lorazepam by my doctor, it was from a rude emergency room physician who told me I have a serious anxiety issue that’s debilitating to my life and I really need to get help. And she sent me home with a prescription for 10 tablets of 1mg lorazepam. Like geez lady. OK, thanks, I’m trying to get help. 

This was about 45 days ago and I still have 6 tablets left (only taken 4.) I took one the night after my trip to the ER because I had no idea it was a benzo and thought I could do this daily. Luckily my doctor rang my phone and told me otherwise. Then a month later I went on a week-long cruise. I took 3 pills total that week, every other night because I refused to let myself have a panic attack on vacation. 

Here I am now, 8 days after my last dose, feeling very anxious tonight and eyeing the bottle…taking one will make the pain go away almost instantly, but if I do have one then I know it’s only short term and I’ll feel like I’m failing. 

Does anyone else feel like a failure if they have to take a benzo?"

516,Anxiety,"Leaving my job due to severe anxiety, feeling guilty","I’ve been working part time at my current job as a CNA for 3 years. I really enjoy my job and decided to go full time a few months ago. About a month ago, I ended up having a severe panic attack while at work. Ever since, my anxiety (which I’ve always had can usually cope with) has just gotten way worse, to the point where I am considering starting medication. 

I think that my job is the main source of the anxiety. I work 40 plus hours a week and have an hour long commute to get to work and back for not that great of pay. This plus the job itself being very emotionally draining is starting to take its toll. I don’t think I can keep this up, especially when I spend my days now trying to prevent myself from having another panic attack.

My problem is that I’m afraid to tell management that I need to go back to part time. I feel like I’m gonna make everyone mad at me, especially considering we are severely understaffed, I’ve been putting off talking to management for weeks now because I’m so scared.  To make it worse, I absolutely love my coworkers and I know they will be disappointed that I am leaving my full time position. Any advice on how to overcome this? I feel like a complete failure."

I’m 27 I know I should get over it but I can’t, one moment really stuck to me when he out loud told the whole class why my face always turns red. Since then I’ve always been worried someone is going to point out my anxiety. My anxiety has only gotten worse since I was in school. I also worry that they’re gonna tell me I can’t get braces because of how my teeth are which would be embarrassing this is also holding me back from making an appointment."

It seems everything I say ends up making him more upset. I tried saying things like ""Friends aren't always meant to last forever"" or ""Change is a natural part of life"" but I feel like maybe thats the wrong thing to say. He is autistic which makes life changes even more difficult to handle for him, especially because he's losing a lot of things that help him feel stable and safe.

528,Anxiety,Trouble getting over driving mistakes?,"Does any one else deal with this? Anytime I make any sort of mistake while driving, I get unreasonably embarrassed about it for a LONG time after the fact. Like I keep replaying it in my mind for days afterwards. I already have so much anxiety as-is when I'm driving---these mistakes certainly don't help anything.

Anyways, long story short: earlier today I was driving on some unfamiliar roads. I needed to turn left, so I get into the left turn lane, wait for the green arrow, and then make my turn. As soon as I complete my turn, I have the horrifying realization that the road I was turning on was divided (with a wide median) and that I was going up the wrong side. I was literally shaking and FREAKING out. Luckily there was nobody in the lane I had turned onto to, but there were cars in the other lanes/people outside watching this whole thing happen. I was able to quickly turn off into a parking lot just up the road where I literally broke down crying out of embarrassment. 

It's been several hours and I'm still not over it. I am paranoid that someone might've took a picture/video of my stupidity. What if it ends up on the internet? It's a small-ish town, so what if I was spotted by someone who knows me?

I feel like I'm too embarrassed to ever go back out on the roads in this town after that little mishap."

531,Anxiety,Your Journey Is An Amends,"For context: I've had GAD since I was in middle-school and overtime I medicated said anxiety through drugs and alcohol. I truly believe my anxiety is the onset and culprit of most of my proceeding mental heath issues. It's the gateway illness that leads to a lot of negative in my life.

I was recently talking to someone who used to sit in on AA meetings for their undergrad nursing degree. One of the topics that stuck with them was steps 8-9. Essentially, make amends to people UNLESS these amends will cause them further harm. I, like most alcoholics/addicts, have harmed people closest to me. And I, like most alcoholics/addicts, want to make amends to those people closest to me. However, some of those people I would devastate even more.

I never grasped my anxiety. My anxiety turned to anger. My anger turned to recklessness. My recklessness turned to eventually consequences. Those consequences fueled anxiety and continued to provide energy to the loop.

I've recently decided to go to therapy to get a grasp on my anxiety. I've started writing more. I've started eating better. Drinking less. Facing my anxiety head-on. In short, I'm not letting my anxiety cause eventual fuck-ups anymore.

This journey is aligned with steps 8 and 9. I'm not apologizing to my loved ones verbally. I haven't written any letters. But I've hugged the cactus. I've through my journey of self-recovery and eventual improvement I've apologized in ways we've all wanted to do. Through action.

I'm hopeful one day I have the strength to confront my loved one's and verbally apologize. However, if your anxiety has led  you down a path that you look back on and cringe. And if you're embarrassed or feeling guilt from your anxiety, know that your path to getting better is making amends to not only yourself but your loved ones. 

The journey and the fight, that's what matters. Your journey is an amends."
532,Anxiety,"My anxiety is so subtle, almost like a background noise I barely notice. But it's there all the time.","I can't tell panic attacks from normal daily life moments anymore because my emotions are just all tangled up inside me. I can't cry, I don't even pace or shake. There are zero physical manifestations of my panic attacks but there seems to be this drone-like thrum that I only notice when I think deeply about how I'm really feeling. And I guess it's anxiety. 

It's hard to live like this, because I cant seem to have a peaceful time even though I'm at home and off work. It's supposed to be time for me to feel some semblance of contentment and other positive things. But the dread never leaves. There is a social event next month that I'm required to attend. I've been thinking about that more and more and honestly I don't wanna go but it's for work. And I have to  go if I don't wanna risk being labeled as the freak in the office. 

I hope this feeling leaves me to be at peace even for just a few hours. GAD is hell."
533,Anxiety,Do I Actually Have Anxiety?,"I commonly, multiple time a day, have what I know are the symptoms of an anxiety attack, and I feel what I think I would describe as anxiety. I have been diagnosed with, and have been medicated (with mixed effectiveness) for anxiety. I have all the symptoms except one.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not worried. About pretty much anything.

Dad 3 hours late to pick me up and not answering his phone? He'll either get here when he gets here or I'll hear he's dead later, no point in wondering about it until I have the facts.

Nervous that the cat will get hurt while I'm gone? I've done the best I can to cat proof so, as I can not improve it, if it was gonna happen it's gonna happen and there is little to fix it, so no need to dwell.

Exam? I've already done however much or little studying I have. Can't go back. Do my best; stressing is illogical and counterproductive.

&amp;#x200B;

As part of the definition of anxiety involves worry, it makes me doubt whether I have anxiety at all. I fidget and stress, feel unease (for literally nothing; I'll just be standing in my living room), feel like I can't breathe, feel an overwhelming sense of doom with no source, all that good stuff. But no worry.

540,Anxiety,I am in the best mental space I have ever been in and I’m so surprised bc a year ago I couldn’t leave my house,"let me start this off by I AM SO GRATEFUL. Like mentally I have truly never been this better. 2 months ago I was edging calling a  hotline, and a year before that I was dealing with severe paranoia and anxiety and dealing with a domestic abuse household. (Plus many other things that are equally traumatizing). I would like to think that I slowly made myself get mentally healthier and that this wasn’t overnight.  And I mean I have a good understanding of temporary happiness, where your happiness is a symptom of good things happening to you. But this is different because something arguably bad happened to me, and I was able to express my emotions and move on from the situation and not let it fester and overthink the situation. I started working out earlier this month, and it wasn’t to fulfill body image issues I just like the way I feel after.(It also gives me a strong sense of self discipline that I enjoy) 
i am so happy I was able to work through my problems. I have dealt with a fair amount of adversity and when that happens you have such a narrow view on what happiness really is.
I hope this helps someone, I remember I would turn to Reddit whenever i felt like the stress and anxiety would never end"
541,Anxiety,Existential crisis,"It seems I’m having an existential crisis. What meaning does life have, does god exist, if god does exist why did he create us who created him, is heaven really what I want. Once we die is our free will taken if we do get into heaven will I truly be happy. If he’ll exist that’s not what I would want either. If reincarnation is it will I just endlessly live life never remembering the one before but if that’s the case then is living really special at all. If that’s the case there will never be an answer at the end of what life is. Even if I found the answer what could I do with it. If there is nothing at the end what was the point will I feel the eternal nothingness will my consciousness never exist? I’m not worried I’ll be forgotten but I’m scared I will never be able to experience life no matter how it comes. I know trying to find the answer behind creation is impossible, but just thinking about it continually how life came to be I can’t seem to get it out of my head. Of course I’ve always come to the conclusion that I can’t control it so whatever feels right has to be right and all I can do is live. Which worked for some time but recently my worries have only grown. Possibly because of my own personal failures in life. Did poorly in school 1 year of college and haven’t continued since I stopped, in and out of jobs, I feel like I do poorly in my relationships and then I think the solution is simply to change or find my passion and work toward it. But I resign myself and just continue to ponder and slowly but surely change. I’m 21 soon to be 22 and I guess I just want to know peoples thoughts about this."
542,Anxiety,Zoloft 25 mg,"I recently started Zoloft 25mg. I have terrible panic attacks and I’m extremely afraid of medication so the one thing that should help me also scares me so my doctor said I can start with 12.5 and work my way up. It’s day 4 and I took a little more than 12.5 and my anxiety is through the roof. I know this is a side effect, I’ve been reading so many other posts about this very thing from other people experiencing it but I just need to hear more success stories. It’s so hard to keep taking it knowing I’m basically throwing myself into a fire of panic just in hopes that in a few weeks I will be a normal functioning less anxious person. I will keep taking it but I’m just so exhausted of fighting these anxiety/panic attacks. This is my first time taking medicine and I do feel better for the most part, I wasn’t really feeling any side effects until today with the worst of all-increased anxiety. Please just reply with how long it took for your anxiety to lessen and just overall support. I’m asking for support in this post."
543,Anxiety,I feel dumb and silly… :(,"I have an issue I been smoking a ton of weed and well… it’s been helping except when I get way way too high…. 


Looks like 20 days ago from my post history i got anxious leaving my bag in a car for like 20m and I got anxious it was possible someone messed with my weed somehow.

i realize this sounds silly


The fear came back! I know it sounds irrational and silly but… :("
544,Anxiety,Am I the only one this paranoid?,This is a hair width from how paranoid I  am any way walking my dog it's a nice day I look st the nice blue sky and clouds my brain automatically goes to I'm going to get sucker up into the sky I start panicking I try telling myself it's mot going to happen but my brain insists that this is going to happen and its a real threat its a pain sigh

I’m on Alprazolam and other benzodiazepines medication. They are only temporary and it’s frustrating. When the panic attack me, I cannot deal with this immense amount of fear and I am so done with this.
I attempted suicide 2 years ago and haven’t thought about it since then. 
I cannot stand this I am not even a Reddit user. I’m a new Canadian immigrant and most of my friends are in South Korea. I barely have friends here. I cannot live with this anymore"
547,Anxiety,How do you manage??,"Hey everyone 👋 hope everyone’s well and keeping safe. I’ve been struggling with my anxiety for all my adolescent years and early adult life ( only 21 ). Been diagnosed with GAD; worrying that I was gonna die in my sleep, panic attacks every day with severe chest pain which always resulted me convincing myself I was having a heart attack;  I couldn’t function as a human being.  

Been put on the medication escltalopram and things have been a lot more calmer; no panic attacks; no obsessive thoughts as such, can breath again without feeling like I was being suffocated. 

But even though I’m a lot better I still have my bad days; I feel like everything’s crashing around me; I’m going to lose everything etc does anyone have these sorts of days if so how do you manage? I’ve tried meditation, yoga, relaxing music but my mind won’t be quiet. It goes a 100 miles per hour.

548,Anxiety,Should I take SSRI?,"Hello, I’m 25 years old male European. My doctor said yesterday that I have anxiety neurosis and hypochondria, I feel pain in my right stomach side, under the rib, sometimes lower, sometimes on the back but always on the right side. I thought it could something serious, googled symptoms (from cancer to cancer, if not this one, than maybe another one), had anxiety attacks (scared of death), had endoscopy, morphology, liver and pancreas blood tests, on Monday I’ll have ultrasound of my stomach (had one 9 months ago that didn’t show anything to worry about), but he pain is there and I focus only on this pain. I’m nervous and explosive. I could try to use some herbal medicine and change my mind now that I know I have this”mental disorder”. Are the SSRI safe and worth it? How long must someone use them after curing the problem? I have inflamed lower throat where it connects to the esophagus - doc told me it’s reflux (but I read that neurosis and anxiety can also cause reflux like symptoms). Thanks in advance."

551,Anxiety,I wrote a thing called Anxiety,"Anxiety

Everything is great, genuinely, I feel that I’m living my best life, doing a job I love and things are where I want them to be. So why do I wake up at 3am panicking about work? I think about things that I can’t do anything about at 3am. I think about things that don’t even exist…non-problems that my brain merrily turns into problems that then makes my breathing short and gives me that cold water feeling down my back…at 3am…when I can’t do anything about it. 
It then means that I don’t sleep properly, and then when I wake up and think about my day ahead I feel worried and tired and breathless. 
I get to work, everything is fine. Problems are easily solvable, nobody is putting excess pressure on me or expecting me to produce a miracle. So why the anxiety? Ask my brain."

553,Anxiety,i don't even know who i am,"long rant incoming, im sorry. basically i hate myself, i hate everything about myself. i've been shamed and sheltered from doing simple things growing up that now i'm afraid of everything and everyone. i just had very little guidance growing up and i feel like its coming to beat my ass now. i sound like an idiot when i talk to people or do anything, i feel so inept. Im so hyperaware of how awkward i am and i hate it. Im constantly thinking about how others percieve me. It seems like some people like me and being friends with me so i guess i dont have it that bad. But i get so nervous and scared around my OWN friends. I have no confidence and my trust in others is so bad. All i can think about is negative. Maybe because i feel so dishonest myself, i expect dishonesty and distrust from others as well. I have no idea what my personality really is. I feel so fake. Im so hateful, bitter, judgemental, which i try my best to hide. and im a giant fucking pussy. i wish everyone would just forget about me. It sucks because i hate being lonely and i crave friendship but i just feel too stupid and scared to be my ""true self"". I dont even know what my ""true self"" is.. i think my true self is just ""scared"". this was long and probably makes no sense, im sorry"

555,Anxiety,Still struggle with heart health anxiety after multiple tests.,"I’ve gotten 5 ecg’s,multiple blood tests,echocardiogram and excercise stress test done. All came out good and they tell me I have a healthy heart. Yesterday they measured my blood pressure and it was very high with a heart beat of only 49 which made me go in a panick attack ( I do take bisoprolol to keep my blood pressure low and maybe it has something to do with that on top of stress) . I just can’t lose the feeling my heart is about to give up on me at 26 years old. So scared of getting cardiac arrest while I got so many tests done that surely something would pop up if I had an underlying problem. My days are just filled with anxiety and I don’t see it getting better. Feeling tingling in my chest,contractions and a bruised feeling. Normally heartrate is from 60-75 but I’m just so very scared it consumes me and my life."

557,Anxiety,Any stories about getting back together after breaking up &amp; anxious partner doing counselling?,"Hi. My partner recently ended our long-term relationship at the height of anxiety (looked like he was panicking and was impulsive). He is not regretting it so far. Near-breakups happened several times in the past but this is our first break up. (Near-breakups started with having a break for a while because he wasn’t sure if I was the one or the relationship was the right one, but then he always came back feeling determined that I was the one, he loved me so much, and it was anxiety that was doing terrible things.)

He had several counselling sessions before, even though he claimed them to be useless. But this time, he is motivated to go counselling to sort things out by himself. He says “this is my problem”.

He doesn’t know if we eventually get back together and doesn’t want to give me false hope, but he “cares a lot about” me and told me to contact him anytime if I want. He appreciates my support and understanding of him.

I know things are different from one couple to another and nobody can say for sure what happens next to us, but is he likely to come back? I guess I want to hear good stories about how counselling made your mind clear about the importance of your relationship and made you see that your relationship is worth pursuing."
558,Anxiety,I was going so good without having anxiety over anything….,"But once I see this white thing in my cut on my finger in the shower, I immediately thought ‘shit it’s pus... it’s probably infected… I probably have sepsis’.

Now I feel sick to my gut and I feel anxious that I do have sepsis. If anything, the white thing was probably a little bit of soap, as there is no pus now. Plus I cut my finger on like… tuesday so that was a few days ago now, so I assume pus would’ve come up then? The cut is not hot to touch (or around it) so I assume I’m fine?

I shouldn’t have googled… I’m so anxious now. I haven’t worried about my health in months :("
559,Anxiety,Are SSRIs worth it if it causes you insomnia,"I can’t get past the first few days of taking SSRIs (citalopram) due to the insomnia it causes. My mind races and I genuinely don’t sleep.

I was the whole time wondering if i’d live like that for the rest of my life. There would always be racing thoughts in my uncontrollable mind."
563,Anxiety,Was doing well with depression but an opponent in an online game really messed me up,"I was playing a really popular online FPS (not giving it away because I want extra anonymity and it doesn't matter anyway) and I was playing pretty okay: not my best nor my worst. I got some kills in and two of them were of one player.

Later they finally got a kill on me when I approached two enemies alone. I was like ""whatever"" because I admittedly walked into that, it was 2v1, and I knew that I wasn't playing at my best that game. But then the one player proceeded to teabag me for a relative while (a solid 5 seconds). Not even their other teammate joined in.

I've only been teabagged a handful of times over my collective 3 years of playing the game-mostly bc I play console-and it's only ever gotten me annoyed at most. But for some reason, it was different this time.

It genuinely hurt me because I literally did not do *anything* to the player and it was so fast and aggressive, as if they really wanted to insult me. Plus, it was a sneaky kill and I didn't even see them, so not necessarily something to gloat about.

After watching a replay of our match, it may have seemed like I was targeting them because only *I* ever killed then, but even then I only killed them twice (they hid from my team for most of the game). I killed their teammates almost an equal amount of times. They did not act like this to anyone else and if anything, they would always go to damage ME whenever they had a choice. I just felt so targeted.

I did get my revenge, but I had to go a little out of my way to do it. When I did kill them they typed (basically) ""what a good job helping your team"" Later, both our teams were attacking each other equally and they got a kill off me because of it and then they teabagged me AGAIN even though I literally was not even paying attention to them nor attacking them. Like, why so agro? They had a personal vendetta against me or something.

On the game's subreddit it seems to be split 60/40 between people who think teabagging is just a light-hearted joke/a strategy to deliberately tilt opponents or just straight-up BM respectively. So it feels like I'm being too sensitive about it and I should just shut up because ""it's just pixels and how can pixels be offensive?""

I know this is a very small incident, but it really did affect me a lot and I don't even know why. I've never been the target of a chat insult before, so I guess the criticism just freaked me out (combined with their behavior toward me in-game). It ruined the rest of my night. I honestly forgot about my good games afterward until writing this now. I haven't gotten depressed for a little bit. Why did this have to bring it back?
So, am I being too sensitive? How do I just let this kind of stuff go?"
564,Anxiety,Is it normal to not do anything on day offs?,"I work currently (internship). So i am pretty much occupied in the week. On weekends i don’t have much to do currently. So i stay at home, watch things i like, go out for walks, read books (tbh i need to read more, during college my capability to read books decreased for some reason), clean and vibe alone. Is that weird? My colleagues who are older than me always got a lot to do on weekends. Now i feel weird about that. 

Would you consider what i described as bizarre? I don’t like hanging out with people as that exhausts the shit out of me. I live in a village type of area so there isn’t much to do."
565,Anxiety,"Advise on undiagnosed ""loud sound"" anxiety.","On a trip with the family in New Orleans. During the day its fine. People walking to work. People being tourists normal. But I knew I was sensitive to competing voices/music/sound (i didnt have this as a child or in my early 20s- new thing). Didn't want to be a ""bummer"" night one as we walked Bourbon St (rows of bars and noise), but I did end up leaving early - Saying I was tired. The other night we went to Arnaulds (sp?) Very nice restaurant closed in with a lot of people in the limited space, very loud and many conversations, and staff coming up behind to give you plates or ask how your doing (startling me many times). 

I left the building once to get air and quiet. Second time out was when I thought I could brave it out but reached the point of heavier breathing and crying so family noticed. I managed to stick around until dessert (a fancy fire show - didn't want to be a bummer) and when I finally left, it was much the same of breathing and crying. 

To explain it the loud competing sounds I dislike. Too much to focus on. Too Loud. 

My friend with a different anxiety says her therapist recommends ice in the palm. Grounds you. Any other ideas or coping mechanisms? At least until I can make it home and talk to someone. (Didn't realize how bad it was.)"

568,Anxiety,Anxiety about the future of mental health,So with tragedies like what happen in Texas and certain individuals claiming its a mental health problem. I genuinely fear that one day we with mental disorders will one day but hunted down imprisoned and executed simply fir having mental disorders. Maybe it's just my imagination is working in overdrive.
569,Anxiety,Should I switch therapist?,"As the title suggests, but some background info on my situation.

I've had a hard time finding a therapist for over 2 years with through my primary doctor and insurance. Everytime I told them I needed help I never got assigned to anyone. I would call multiple offices and never got a reply back. I felt very alone and desperate during this time without having anyone to talk to.

I was finally able to make appointments with a therapist through my school's sources and it went really well. She helped me organize my life. I didn't really know how to deal with my stress and anxiety and she showed me how to tackle my problems one step at a time. In a way, it felt like I was being coached for a sport. She set-up a plan of for me to follow and it was very straightforward. Every week we would set a goal and I was suppose to reach it. If I didn't we would go over what went wrong and how I we could ""win"" the next time. We started with first figuring out my triggers, followed by figuring out how to ease stressful situations, then by learning how to avoid those triggers all together. 

It was very methodical. Everytime I felt lost, she would not only help through my problems, but also teach me how our minds work and why we respond the way we do. This teach and practice method of tackling stress/anxiety helped me a lot. 

The next step she was going to teach me is how to confront my fears and learn to live with them. She said it was the next BIG step, but I would have to continue this process with the next therapist, since I wouldn't be able to see her anymore.

When I graduated I was no longer able to be her patient anymore. She is only available through the school and I'm not a student anymore. She told me to explain to the next therapist what I had learned and gone through so that my next therapist could pick off where I left off. She explained to me that each therapist is different and that I should be open to new ideas. I was okay with all of this, provided I would be able to go on to the next step which is facing my fears that cause me stress a.d anxiety. 

I wanted to continue to progress and learn how to manage my anxiety. Just like how an athlete continues to evolve their skills to better prepare themselves for a game. 

I was able to find a new therapist and on the first day I explained to her all of this. My new therapist thanked me for the explanation and said she could help me continue to progress. 

However, ever since I started seeing my new therapist (also a woman) she hasn't helped me progress. I'm back at square one where she keeps asking me how my week has been and how to recognize stress triggers. I don't have in person consultations with her and instead I have them over a video call. 

Often times she is distracted and won't be listening or interrupts me and then leaves the room for multiple periods of time. She talks for extended periods of time with no point to her story and I honestly don't feel like she's helping me in any aspect.

I guess it's nice to have someone listen to me when I've had a bad week. However, I've learned previously with the school counselor how to deal with anxiety so these talks don't really do anything for me. On the contrary I feel like they waste my time because I want to progress rather than stay in the same spot.

I've confronted her before about how she sometimes wastes time and she's apologized and then I'm able to get a bit of new teachings. But this keeps happening. I'm tired of having to remind her that she's being rude by constantly leaving and not listening. My thought is that why even bother asking me ""how I'm doing"" if she isn't going to be paying attention.

She seems nice enough, but Im not getting the help I need or want. Should I change therapist? Should I just keep trying to tell her that sometimes she comes off as being rude? I don't want to be without a therapist again for 2 years, but I don't feel like I'm going anywhere right now with my current therapist."

582,Anxiety,Weird anxiety involving blue clear skies,"I in recent years developed this weird anxiety when there are clear blue skies with no clouds. I feel like im super exposed and that im conscious of the millions of billions of miles of nothing above and around me and i start to feel paralyzed and scared and clutching myself. I imminently want to get to some structure or indoors when this happens. I almost get this sense like im staring into abyss and its staring back, or if im not looking at it but aware of it that its looking at me. Whenever its cloudy or a rainy day i feel none of this. It only occurs in open blue skies and especially when im in an open environment away from immediate structures or tree's. I try to remain calm and sort of have to on the outside and try to not let it show to those around me when it happens and often just use some excuse to get inside. Yet if its a heavily cloudy day i dont feel this way. I've tried to look it up online but to no avail. Has anyone else had or know this type of anxiety?"

585,Anxiety,I'm paranoid people are out to get me or hurt me... How do I stop these intrusive thoughts?,"I've been emotionally hurt in the past by people who have disappointed me and let me down. Basically friends who are two-faced or have hidden motives with me. I've felt so powerless and defenseless in those situations in the past because it's usually 5 or 6 of them against me. It's been tough to feel SAFE in my own apartment and even, my body. As a result , I noticed I've been avoiding meeting new people and giving older friends a chance. SO I went out with a friend the other day and the hangout was a bit weird. She wasn't being completely direct with me and even hit on me... kept asking if I liked her... and it just threw me through a whole loop. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't think much of it in the hangout and laughed it off as I was driving home....but then the next day the intrusive thoughts showed their ugly head. I started getting superrrrr anxious about her coming after me or her Ex (who never liked me in the past by the way) would come after me if she found out we hung out. And I just feel... afraid to even be in my own home. All this from one stupid hangout. How do I cope with these thoughts that I KNOW are absurd and unlikely? I don't want to resort to distancing myself from others again because that's not how I want to live my life. I don't wanna hide myself. Sometimes I feel like I dim my own light to let others shine just so that I can stay out of spotlight... if that even made sense. I'd appreciate any and all advice! thank you."
586,Anxiety,undescribable discomfort when drinking water and eating food. could be anxiety related.,"I always get this pretty painful and distracting discomfort whenever I drink water and when I sometimes eat, for example I'll feel:

Sharp pain on the right side of my back, pain when sometimes swallowing non-soft foods (I can almost feel it going down my chest) same thing happens with water, discomfort around my stomach area, a knot feeling around my chest especially when I'm sitting or laying down, drinking water will also cause a brief moment of breathlessness (also causes shortness of breath when laying down), uncomfortable bloating, lots of belching during and after meals.

I am at a new school and at may 5th (I think) I had my first day of school there and before I had to go to school I got really anxious. it's been almost a month now and my school anxiety still hasn't calmed down. It's not as bad as my social or my phobia type of anxiety but I just don't want it anymore. any tips or advice or anything else would be great.
588,Anxiety,Anxiety attacks about work,"Almost everyday before work , I have so much anxiety, especially when it’s a full shift. My chest is tight, I feel very nauseous and I shit myself more than 5 times. Sometimes I have to leave my desk and cry, and I even self sabotage with work avoidance every now and then, but it’s honestly because I’m about to explode in those moments.

My job is not even that bad, my manager is supportive, and the benefits are the best I’ve ever had. I went part time for a year since last March &amp; it was still kind of stressful, but manageable. After a year part time, I’ve lost my benefits and had to go back to 40 hours as I need the insurance for therapy where my therapist is recommending I seek out a PCP also because we’re suspecting I likely have ADHD &amp; my therapist thinks I need medication to help with my executive dysfunction which makes my anxiety worse.

In the meantime I am drowning. I used over 40 hours to take off last month and am almost out of time my anxiety is skyrocketing. I don’t know what to do and am hanging on by a thread as I try and make it 2 weeks till my next therapy appointment and 1 month almost till I meet with a PCP. My therapist tells me take it 1 day at a time, but I have so little time in my day after work and that makes me feel so trapped and like an impending cloud of terror is always following. I need the job for insurance to get better, but I’m struggling so much to work the job. I feel like shit because this is all in my head but I’m physically sick everyday I have to work a full shift

How do you guys make it through each day? I don’t know if this was a rant or if I’m looking for help, but I feel so lost and overwhelmed having to mask at work when I’m struggling immensely mentally"
589,Anxiety,buspirone is a trip,"so,
started buspirone 5mg 2x a month ago. tried to to off it because I felt strange/more dissociated. only lasted a day or two because then I convinced myself that the wearing off was giving me dissociation as well, so I started it again. dissociated WORSE and couldn’t stay awake. I don’t even remember yesterday for the most part lmfao. feeling better this morning but SHAKY and like I can’t move off my couch. doctor won’t prescribe me anything besides hydroxyzine- I don’t want to SLEEP, I just want my thoughts to chill w/o me dissociating.

590,Anxiety,COVID anxiety,"Warning: gross things like vomit and illness are talked about.  
 
I'm having combined depression/anxiety around COVID. My anxiety usually spikes around things that have happened- like if I hadn't gotten sick for 2 weeks and coughed until I threw up ( and I'm boosted) I wouldn't be so anxious around work super spreaders, mask optional doctors offices, etc. ( theres also work- children coughing blood, kids so ill the parent was scared for their life) There's no seeming reason for my lack of immunity- my immune system just says "" nope we're being sick for weeks now"". I take vitamins, I try to exercise, but I fear I'll be sick for a month each year or worse when they give up worse  and we won't even have the pills to give anybody.

Like, when I think about my future now I end up thinking 'this is what I'm going to do... IF I make it back.' It's so annoying because I know all of those things are incredibly unlikely, but I can't get over the fact that they COULD happen. 

Any advice appreciated :)"

599,Anxiety,Bothered By Unhelpful Thoughts?,"It can happen so easily. You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or, maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been. 

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

### These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.** 

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.   
 

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.  


**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.  


● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.  


**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**  
 

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?  
 

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**"
600,Anxiety,"On my way to office, having an anxiety attack",I have social anxiety and I’m super stressed about spending the day at office today. Please help me calm down
601,Anxiety,I just realized I forgot to call my dad yesterday for his 60th birthday and am currently freaking out.,"Basically the title. I sent a card Friday so I’m hoping he got that in time but tomorrow is not going to be a good day. Having a lot of anxiety right now. 

For some context on how he will react: A few years ago when I was in college, I was at a concert and I 8pm ish I realized I had forgotten to call him that day in his birthday so I sent a text to say happy birthday. That wasn’t enough and he kept calling so I had to leave the concert to call him, he was pissed. I had an anxiety attack and the concert was completely ruined for me because I couldn’t get out of my bad mood after talking to him. I understand him being upset but he made me feel awful. He told me that night that he expects a call on his birthday, Father’s Day and Christmas. I have tried so hard never to forget this.

I know I’m not a bad daughter, he definitely isn’t the best dad. There’s been a lot of shit I have had to put up from him throughout the years. Tomorrow we will talk and he will be mad and passive aggressive when I talk to him. I also had a migraine all day yesterday (they also make me forgetful) and was over the toilet for a bit, not that this is an excuse for forgetting but it didn’t help me remember!!!"
602,Anxiety,Can’t shake my anxiety even after days,"Been a while since I posted here, which I guess means I’ve been doing fairly well for a while. But for some reason this week, I’ve had what I THINK is a high level of anxiety for days on end. I say I “think” because my fear is that there’s something else that’s wrong with me. I have a lot of health anxiety so every time I get anxiety symptoms I start to worry it’s something worse. I’ve basically been having heart palpitations, nausea/stomach aches, lightheadedness, numbness in my hands, and racing thoughts for 4 days now. I’m not currently in therapy so I don’t really have anyone to call for a sanity check. Is this probably just anxiety? Or am I really sick somehow? I really really want it to go away. I’m trying to just let myself feel it so it can run its course and eventually pass, but it hasn’t yet. I just want to know for sure that it’s just anxiety and it’ll go away on its own. I’m getting really scared at this point but trying not to let my imagination run amok."

I believe that I have undiagnosed GAD. Throughout the pandemic, I have been extremely careful, worn a good mask, and I have gotten my booster shot. However, I was recently around someone who tested positive for COVID, and now I have similar symptoms. I have tried listening to music and working on other things but I am quite terrified about Long Covid (long-term effects) and how sick I will get. I was wondering if anyone here may have any advice.

605,Anxiety,"three day long anxiety attack, I'm making myself sick","Please tell me some tips to stop this. I have the most horrible feeling or dread and i can't tell you what's causing it. Its making me act paranoid and crazy. I'm getting irrationally upset over, 

1. I'll fail all my classes (I'm an honors student)
2. My friends are all preparing to leave me. (I don't know where I came from but I'm legitimately terrified.) 
3. My father is going to raise his voice and start berating me. (He hasn't done this in a while) 

I feel like I'm going to throw up almost constantly. I start to feel a little better when I'm home alone but if that happens it happens for a very short amount of time. I can't totally explain my symptoms, it's just a horrible anxiety attack. I'm waking up begging my parents not to force me out of bed because I'm so scared. I almost broke down into tears this morning when my mom told me to get out of the car in front of school. 

Is there anything I can do to minimize It? I've had these before and usually if I remove the thing triggering it it'll stop. But this is one of those times nothing specific started it. I guess I just have to wait it out?"
606,Anxiety,Anxiety in regards to occupation when meeting new people.,"Does anyone else get severe anxiety about what they do for a living when meeting friends of friends? 

I don’t have a lot of friends. I have a ton of acquaintances and people I used to know, people from school that I still talk to and plenty of online buddies. However, when I say friends, I mean people you’d take a bullet for and know they’d do the same. 

 In recent years, my career path took a drastic turn due to all of my mental health struggles and I work an honest but essentially, dead end job. It’s a paycheck and benefits and I’m just proud of myself for being able to get through a workday with the unbearable weight of anxiety and depression that I experience. If I get through a shift without a panic attack, that’s a massive success. 

 I’m struggling lately though as the few friends I do have, are quite successful. One of my best friends whom I’ve known since I was 17 (now in my late 30’s) I met when he was my manager and mentor at a previous job many years ago. I’ve always treasured his friendship and looked up to him. He become rather successful by building a home loan brokerage firm with his wife who is also in real estate, and he has his hands in commercial land development as well. Lovely home in the high end part of town, cabins up in the woods to vacation in etc. his daughter just graduated with a prestigious full ride scholarship to an Ivy League school and his son is an engineer. 

Their entire family are well educated, and all successful in their fields, in addition to being pretty well off. Through their business and philanthropy work, they meet all manner of extremely interesting people. Artists, activists, professors and all manner of professionals both young and old. 

I never went to college, I live with 2 roommates in a seriously run down house in an awful part of town. I work in customer support for the online division of a corporation making barely enough to get by while getting screamed at by clients for shit that is entirely out of my hands. Not the most interesting life. I’m a failed musician and took a 50k pay cut between my last career and my current job after having to take off an entire year and live on what few investments I had to get into extensive therapy/treatment for my various anxiety and depression related disorders. From panic disorder to borderline agoraphobia. I pretty much lost everything and now when I meet new people, I dread THAT question to the point that I literally will start sweating and get shakey. 

“So… what do you do?” 

I hate it. I often cancel plans or decline invites with bullshit excuses if I find out that people I don’t know will be there. I feel awful too because my friend will make a point sometimes to tell me that he’s excited for me to meet this or that person because he thinks I will just love them and visa versa. These are interesting people that I would love to meet but I’m so ashamed and anxious about being the lower middle class failure. Or more so that they will perceive me as such. I then start second guessing everything, like why does this guy and his lovely wife want me around anyway? I don’t belong here. 

I know that this all stems from my own issues of inadequacy and self worth/self image and paranoia but am I alone here? 

Does anyone else feel sheer terror about their line of work when meeting new people? 

This friend has told me so many times that he loves me for who I am and he knows my struggles, so he never gets upset if I bow out of an invite. He just always tells me I’m the Bukowski to his inner Hunter Thompson and that he’ll never stop inviting me when he feels the mix is right. I just hope I can learn to get over myself, get out of my own way and let myself have fun again. I guess this is the “social” part of the social anxiety struggle. 

Sorry for the rant, thanks for hangin out if you made it here."

608,Anxiety,Frequent Urination - Looking for Help,"Hello all,

I recently sustained an injury (hernia and pelvic floor dysfunction - possibly) that has resulted in some not fun symptoms, which also includes frequent urination.  However, I am not sure if the urination issues are related to the injury or stress/anxiety - as it only becomes really bad in periods of very high stress (which is often in my job).  

The odd part is that it not only feels like I have to go quite often, but I actually produce a large volume of urine when I go.  And during periods of particularly stressful times, this can be several times in an hour - each time urinating a large amount of liquid.  I am often confused as to where the liquid could be coming from as I limit my water intake.  

It is very distressing and has severely impacted my life and it's all I think about. I'm also having more and more trouble keeping my anxiety in check.  

Has anyone dealt with something similar and, if so, was it related to anxiety? Also, was there any way to overcome it?

Any input is greatly appreciated."

I’m only 20 years old and I turn 21 in 2 months. Now when I say that I resort to smoking weed and drinking an absurd amount of alcohol to cope and to feel like I can enjoy myself. I’ve been doing that since I was 18 and wasn’t really an issue cause you’re still a kid just bumping your head around. But now it’s becoming a problem where this is my 3rd car accident ( no injuries or dui’s). I’m not advancing in a career, and to top it off I hurt the people I love the most. I have a lot of built up anger and animosity towards my parents for our past that I don’t address and when I do I get blown off because they can’t handle that truth yet.

I’ve had heart related anxiety since I had a bad experience with edibles that made my heart rate go up to 160/170. I now have full blown panic disorder and am on drugs to control it (Klonopin and Zoloft) but I’ve still been worried that something is wrong with my heart. Everyone tells me it’s just anxiety but today something abnormal really did happen with my heart and now I just feel defeated. Apparently SVT is rarely life threatening it’s just scary, and usually requires emergency medical attention if you can’t convert to sinus rhythm on your own (which means shelling out $$ 🙃 every time my heart decides to go sicko mode). I just did not need this shit right now. I have a cardiologist appointment in two weeks and I just fucking knew some shit would happen with my heart before the appointment. This is just awful. Now I have to worry every day about this happening again on top of my existing anxiety. They’re putting me on a beta blocker for the time being so hopefully that prevents this from happening again, but fuck man. Why is life so cruel?

Side note: if any of you have ever had adenosine, that shit is crazy. Felt like my entire body seized up and my heart stopped (because it actually did briefly). Scary but kind of cool"

Hi all, recently I have noticed that my right leg feels like it’s going numb or is asleep sometimes. It feels as if my leg is numb but I can still feel it because I held an ice pack to my leg to see if I can still feel the cold and I can. So that makes me believe it’s anxiety related. Has anyone else ever had this before ? I did have two job interviews today and I was anxious for them so that could contribute to a higher sense of anxiety, thus causing the feeling. It comes and goes throughout the day obviously less when I don’t focus on it. I know it is probably anxiety and I have to distract myself and forget about it and let it go but it’s just scaring me it’s something bad Any help is appreciated thanks it does come and go too obviously as I focus on it I realize it more"
620,Anxiety,"Back to where I was 10 years ago. All that progress, gone.","I can't believe I have fallen back so far. I didn't think the pandemic would send me this far back, and yet here we are. 

On Monday, was my rock bottom moment. I was supposed to go on an international vacation and I couldn't get on the plane because I was *convinced* it was going to crash. For two weeks, I couldn't do anything because I was so scared that if I was getting on this plane I was not getting off of it. I could barely eat. I asked multiple people what a ""gut feeling"" felt like because I couldn't shake this feeling something bad was going to happen. Spoiler Alert: The plane landed just fine. I bawled my eyes out at the airport for 2 hours only to feel defeated in the car home and cancel my whole vacation. 

I am a seasoned traveler. I've been on well over 100 flights in my life (mostly for work). I have never had a fear of flying in my life. I enjoy the airport, unlike most people. And now, I can't even get on an airplane. 

Before the pandemic, my anxiety was at a manageable 4, now it's an unmanageable 8-9. 

As life ""returns to normal"" I realize how bad my anxiety actually is and how my life is now once again at its mercy. My anxiety has permeated my life again in more ways than I thought. I had done so much to get better for 10 years of progress only to be ruined in less than 2 years. It has taken over me once again, and I don't even know if it's worth fighting for again."

Usually before an interview or a trip I cannot sleep, which makes the anxiety and panic worse, and it's not uncommon to have to reschedule the morning of an interview or eat the cost of a trip if they deny a refund. If I cannot find a reason to feel interested in a position, I do not last. I know everyone cannot be passionate about their work, but I left a PhD program right before the pandemic where I did work I loved, and I have regretted that decision ever since, and ever since I have been unable to hold a job. 

I don't recognize myself anymore. I can't even drive without having a panic attack, but I can't seem to get any job offers in places that prioritize public transit and accessibility. I have a panic attack every day now. Fuck this."

626,Anxiety,Heart Palpitations are back and Worse than ever.,"Everything hurts, My hearts skipping beats every 10 seconds it seems. 
i feel like i’m 100% gonna die, And if i’m not gonna die now i’m totally gonna fucking die later.

This is 100% the end for me and i know i’m the only one fighting this battle. 
This is how i die.

627,Anxiety,Liquid around my lungs and when I get worked up I can’t breathe!,"Hi everyone, I (34m) have stage 4 cancer and lately it has been causing me to have liquid surround my lungs. I have a drain that I can drain the fluid daily but sometimes when I get worked up I get extremely anxious and almost pass out from not being able to breathe even though my pulseox is in the 90’s.

The point is, in the moments that i was in the spotlight during the games i feel like i just made a fool of myself. I was so anxious that I feel like I acted stupid or maybe my anxiety makes me overthink how I acted. I cant tell. Maybe both. I experienced this before sometimes even with family I’ve seen before.

How do I deal with this and my other teeth problems. I know many people do veneers, or other extensive treatment on teeth because they didnt want braces or because they need it for other reasons. Why it affects me so much? I think of it all days for one year already. It seems I am obsessed. Maybe because my mother already had rotten teeth at my age (36) and I used to hear that all the time from my grandmother when I was little? I am on Lexapro 10mg but it doesnt help it. :("

642,Anxiety,What is it like to have a panic attack? And did I just have one?,"So I was on my to the local bowling ally with my mum driving the car and I was perfectly fine and happy because I love bowling and I had being their so many times but as we arrived I had this overwhelming feeling of sickness.

Before I go on I also wanted to say that this wasn’t car sickness because I had it before and this was beyond.. anyways,The sickness and symptoms I felt were:

- Sudden sweating 
- Feeling extremely faint and nauseous 
- Feeling very cold suddenly for short amounts of time (not even a few seconds)
- Shakiness and instability 
- finding it a little harder to breath then usual but not to hard
- turning Extremely pale. Im not sure if this is true but my mum said I almost looked green.
- heavy heart beat
- Chest discomfort 

Okay I hope in not forgetting anything here but the main reason I asked this dumb question is because although I do have pretty bad social anxiety and ADHD at the time of the ‘panic attack’ I didn’t feel panicked…? 

Okay well I’m done now if you could help it would mean a lot to me, thanks!"
643,Anxiety,"I want to kill myself, someone please give me a reason not to.","(18 M) I can't take anything anymore. I can't sleep anymore, my legs are restless and my mind is racing and I want to cry, every single night. Learning to drive is fucking me over, it scares me so much and it feels like I'll never get used to it. My social anxiety is spiking too, and its keeping me from exercising in public because eventually someone is going to try to beat me and mug me and kill me. I've been in and out of therapy for years now and every few months I'm in it I'm mostly fine and when it's time to end therapy I devolve back into being completely fucked up within another few months AND ITS THE SAME NEVERENDING FUCKING CYLCE OVER AND OVER AGAIN. I don't even have any friends to talk to and I never will because I'm an empty shell that can barely function in society, if at all.

I can't take it anymore, at this rate my life is going to keep being exhausting and futile, and if I could afford it I would buy a handgun and end my suffering here and now. I'm not improving anyone's quality of life anyway, so why the fuck should I keep wasting oxygen? The only thing holding me back is that nothing short of a firearm will guarantee success, and if I survive I'll be in even worse shape than before, with practically no chance to try again. So I'm asking, someone please try to convince me that somehow anything's going to get better, because I can't imagine it ever will. It feels like I'm trapped in Purgatory, and its slowly turning into Hell."
644,Anxiety,Paranoid about good friend,"I have made a good friend this year. She is lots of fun, really open and friendly and invites me to do things with her a couple of times a week.
But I keep being paranoid about the whole thing collapsing and that she doesn’t really like me, I read a lot into facial expressions and tone of voice in voice notes etc. She’s super patient with me discussing these anxieties but if I keep going she’ll get sick of it for sure, I’m going to get clingy. 

Need advice on stopping feeling this way, I don’t want to destroy this relationship. I sort of just need someone to listen to her voice note and tell me she’s actually being nice and not just pretending lol

I’m a guy and only really have a few close friends and she is particularly close. Before you ask we have had that chat and it’s staying platonic. I’ve had close platonic female friends before and one in particular from university days ended up ghosting  me off and on which really hurt and last year she killed herself. This could have something to do with it I don’t know."
645,Anxiety,i absolutely hate the fact that i have all this anxiety in my head,"I had to make this throwaway just so i could vent. I'm so tired, so very tired of myself. I can't keep a job for a year and the ones I get accepted in are ones that make little money and make my anxiety worse (didn't finish college cause my dad decided that my tuition is better off with his mistress. and where im from you need at least a bachelors to get a good enough job). Even the idea of applying to a job scares me. I've been getting by with freelance writing work. But I want to be better. I can't even buy myself a pair of decent shoes to replace my shitty ones. 

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the world owes me anything or that people should pity me. I just really hate that it's so hard for me to be ""normal"". This pandemic isn't helping either, my anxiety is at its worst as it has ever been. I feel like a loser. I want to be able to function like everyone else. I want to get a job I actually enjoy and want to go to, and not cry just because I'm afraid of interacting with people. I want my family to be proud of me. I'm tired of being scared. I just want to...live."
646,Anxiety,My anxiety,This is how bad my anxiety is. The other day I hit a deer and had to remove a piece of plastic from underneath my car that was bent.

I go to bed early with no problems, but I'll always wake up to pee and then every little stress in my life is amplified by 100 and I often am not able to fall back asleep. 

Anyone have any suggestions for dealing with this?"

Because sometimes these pains feel unbearable, like I’m going to die."
650,Anxiety,My 11yo son has terrible separation anxiety - any advice?,"He is an intelligent and sensitive kid. He has always had many worries and is prone to anxiety (as his mom - me). I am doing much better and have been on medication for the last year or so. Therapy has helped me a lot. I feel balanced and calm. No anxiety. 

2-3 months ago he started getting worried about his sister when she's not home. She is 8yo. She is very extroverted and has many friends. She is constantly on playdates.   
We live in a safe country in a very small town, everyone knows each other. School is two minutes walk away. She can bike or walk to most of her friends on her own. She is very responsible, always does as we have agreed on, and comes home at the time I have told her. Basically, no reason for him to worry. 

He also panics if he cannot call me or if I don't respond to his texts immediately. He is afraid of me going out with friends and when my husband and I were on a date he was constantly afraid and texting me the whole time. 

His fears are centred around:  
Me or/and his dad getting in a car accident or disappearing  
His sister having an accident, getting kidnapped, getting lost, disappearing

His anxiety gives him panic attacks where his heart beats like crazy, he sweats, cries and he is adamant that his worst fears is true. It helps to do breathing and grounding exercises, but he still feels like he can't control his thoughts. 

We lost his cousin when she was 6yo and he was 7yo. She had a disease that required a liver transplant and the transplant didn't succeed. She was in the hospital for 100 days, unconscious, before she died. He does not see a connection to his anxiety, but I do... 

He is currently in therapy, but he is not willing to open up. He is reluctant to talk to the therapist and I feel like the more we try and talk about it the worse the anxiety is getting. 

How can I help him? I have had anxiety since my teens and yet I don't know how to help him. I just have no clue?"
651,Anxiety,I hate ignorance.,"What gives people the right, especially those that know you, and you generally get on with, the right to be ignorant? It really pisses me off. I cannot stand ignorance, maybe it’s an anxiety trait, I don’t know, but it’s something that causes me deep hurt and leaves me very hurt. I don’t know why I’m like that to be honest, but what I can say is if your busy, or you don’t want to talk to me, just fucking say that? It’s pretty simple instead of leaving someone on unread/read. It just shows how much of a garbage person you really fucking are."
652,Anxiety,anyone knows what to do?,"So 3 years ago I started experiencing a lot of anxiety and sudden depressive episodes that I didn't know the reason for. And then two months after I started profusely sweating in my palms, feet and armpits. And these symptoms are constant, almost never ending. I'm always in stress, worrying when I'm going to start sweating again and therefore get super cold and uncomfortable and unable to handle not only social situations but even doing something at home. I had to give up so many hobbies of mine because they make me feel uncomfortable now due to the hand sweating. Nobody ever told me what the hell happened to me and why I can't stop this no matter how hard I try... I know the sweating is psychological because when I miraculously manage to not think about it for a while, I'm okay. Or when I get drunk but I can't be drunk every day so I just have to bear with it. These past three years I haven't been living most of the time, I've been surviving and trying to stay sane. Though there are good days when I'm almost totally fine, there are periods when I've even thought about ending my life. I'm not sure what happened to me, if it was trauma or not... I just know nothing is helping me at the moment and I just want to ask if anyone here could give me some advise.
Btw I'm seeing a clinical psychologist and we're trying to work on it by various kinds of meditation, relaxation, stress relief but nothing works long term. I'm starting to feel like I can't relate to anyone and that my issue is so strange I'm probably the only person on earth experiencing this and it's just fogging my brain. I'm getting hopeless here, this week it's especially bad. And I'm scared that this will go on forever."

654,Anxiety,"Like how the fuck am I supposed to go back to the old academically motivated me, who had no clue about anxiety. Yesterday I took my German language exam prep class after not taking classes for maybe 6 months and I could not handle the anxiety. I couldn't not focus on a single word she said.","I was an A* student and my anxiety fucked me up. I really enjoyed studying but I literally can't even bring myself to get to the study table and open up my books. I feel like there's nothing left in me to try and motivate myself. I still have so much of education to complete and idk how am I even going to start with it.
I'm currently taking up german language and I'm at b1 level. I started my new classes yesterday and I could not understand even a single word because my ears were ringing and my eyes were burning. I couldn't even utter a proper sentence. 
During my a2 classes, the teacher was such a bully towards the student. Since then I hated having to go to classes because I always felt dumb even though I knew most of the things. Thanks to him, my fear has taken away all my ability to study and enjoy studying. 
I can still build up the courage to study by myself but that is never enough whilst studying language because if you don't have a continuous conversation in that language, you won't pick up the fluency.
Literally don't know what to do or how to feel."

657,Anxiety,Is it possible to have anxiety with compulsions but not ocd?,"I deal with my anxieties with compulsive behavior. I repeat phrases over and over again until I feel better. I have to do this about 20 times just to get through the day.

I sometimes have to count to myself or touch or check things to make sure they’re there. 

My anxieties are related to things beyond my control, like getting in a car crash or getting in some sort of altercation. 

I also have some bfrbs. 

But, I’ve been told several times I just have anxiety and not ocd. So, I guess my question is, when does anxiety with compulsions become ocd?"

I can't exercise. If I do some HIIT or running I am getting bunch of symptoms like dizziness I can't concentrate I have anxiety and my mind is jumping all over I'm getting thoughts that I will die etc. How to relearn my stupid brain that exercises are not dangerous? I did all the checks doctors told me I am healthy and can exercise. Yesterday I was on cycling tour with my gf we did 20 miles and near our home I got micro panic attack and thoughts that my heart will stop. It's so annoyed. I see people in the part running I want to do the same. I did jogging 3 years ago 3 times per week 3.5 miles but once got panic attack and then stopped."
664,Anxiety,lying because I have bad anxiety today,So I woke up and immediately had a full blown panic attack idk why. And than have been having bad anxiety for the last 2 hours I am supposed to go to work in 2 hours but I really don't think I can bring myself to walk out the door..am i wrong for calling out sick? I genuinely don't feel good because anxiety is making me nauseous and I'm a nanny to a stay at home working family. I just don't think I want to move from bed I want to take a Hydroxyzine and relax but when I take those I get really sleepy. I can't watch kids like that..
665,Anxiety,I think I need to break up with my girlfriend and I can’t stop thinking about how much it will hurt her,"Basically the title. I’ve never broken up with an SO before but I have been broken up with and it absolutely devastated me. The idea of potentially sending someone who I truly do care about so much into a state of mind like that is almost too much for me to handle, but I have realized that continuing in this relationship causes me anxiety on a daily basis due to the fact that she has a habit of obsessing over negative things/occurrences in her life. 

As someone who’s dealt with anxiety for years now I obviously sympathize with her on a deep level, however prior to our relationship beginning about 6 months ago, I felt I had been steadily improving my mental health and was finally in a good enough place to be in a relationship with someone again. Now, though, because of the fact that I spend so much time with someone not in such a healthy state of mind, I feel myself reverting back into my old mental state. 

There are other factors at play here, too, influencing my reasons to believe that the break up is necessary. I just can’t handle the idea of hurting this person who I care about and want to help so badly. I’m so lost right now and I feel as if whatever choice I make I will regret. I’m going to see her around 5pm EST (11 hours from the time of this post), and while I sit here and know that I have to be honest with her that I simply don’t see it working out in the long run, I can’t say for sure that I’ll be able to pull the trigger when it gets down to it. Seeing her react the way I envision it going down is just not something I think I can ever be prepared for."

670,Anxiety,Am I doing exposure wrong? Challenging myself for the sake of it,"I've been getting CBT and part of it is doing behavioural experiments where I test a negative thought about something, eg. I worry that I will be sick when I drive to the shops, so the test is to go out and drive to the shops. But im really struggling to know when to do these exposures.

Does it really help if I don't actually want or need to go? I think I struggle with secondary depression from my anxiety, so my actual desire to do things just isn't there. I don't *want* or *need* to go to the shops, so that just makes me less likely to do the exposure because there's no incentive. Its so hard to do an exposure when it feels like you're just doing something for the sake of it, if that makes any sense.  The only time I've got over stuff like this in the past is when I've had a spark of actual desire to do stuff, and that motivates me to get better and expose myself to scary situations. But at the moment it's like...trying to get better but with no momentum. Does anyone else get this or have any tips? Should I just do the exposures anyway?"
671,Anxiety,Experiencing anxiety in the stomach a whole day,"Sometimes I have a whole day of anxiety. This is where I get what I guess could be called butterflies on my stomach the whole day. In addition my stomach/chest feels tight and I experince rapid heart rate as well as shortness of breath on and off. Yet, the butterflies and tight stomach/chest stays. Sometimes, it will carry over the next day. This can occur when I wake up on the morning but can often begin just before I sleep. I hope to wake up feeling normal but that's often not the case. Sometimes it'll be gone by the following day whether jrs when I awake or later on.

When this happens it's very hard to handle. Breathing exercises, meditation or general distractions may bring temporary ease at the best. It seems the best I can do at the moment is sit and wait for it to end. It can get so bsd where I feel sick. 

I assume that it can be regarded as an attack once I get the shortness of breath and rapid heart rate: I don't tend to get any other symptoms when this happens (feeling of general anxiety all day),nor usually in a regular attack. Nonetheless, the two symptoms can get really bad and only seems to get worse.

I don't even recall having heavy stress. I recall having slight stress around work and sometimes around my future, for I've been at some time at a crossroad, stuck between two somwhat life-changing decisions. 

Any advice on how to handle this situation would be very much appreciated."
672,Anxiety,Can someone help?,"So to start of I have always been a anxious person, I have bad health anxiety. But I have never had a panic attack ever. So for a week I have had a lot of energy drinks, and fast food roughly 7 bang energy drinks throughout the week. So about 5 days ago I was at a local store with my friend when all of a sudden at checkout I feel so weird. I had derealization I figured. I rush a back home, listen to some music when I get such a weird feeling, the feeling that I was going to die. I walk around then I purposely fell on the couch when I had my first panic attack. I felt so exhausted and tired after that. For the past 5 days I have experienced shaking, fatigue, some derealization, intense heart rate when I even walk. The feeling I’m about to faint or get another panic attack if I walk, and some pain in my head. I am so unbelievably scared. I don’t know what to think. I just want to feel normal again. My mom says snap out of it, and my dad isn’t taking the matter too serious. Can someone tell me what is maybe going on? Do I have some type of brain tumor, or Parkinson’s disease? I have been drinking a lot of water the matter doesn’t help."
673,Anxiety,This is dumb,"My hair is too long and I want a haircut the problem is that I am freaking out about going to the fucking barber. It's so ridiculous it's just a fucking barber I know nothing bad is going to happen but I am still freaking out. First off I need to call them and make an appointment that in itself is already fucking terrible cause ya know calling somewhere is terrible enough and then I have never called a barber before. The last couple years my sister has been cutting my hair cause pandemic shit and all and before that my mom made the appointments so I have never called one before and I am stressing cause I don't know what the fuck to say. 

And then idk how to tell the barber what kinda haircut I want. I used to have long hair and that was easy just told them how much shorter to make it but now I need to know like what kinda fade I want and shit and how many millimetres my hair is supposed to be long on the sides and everything and I don't know any of that cause I just told my sister to do what she wants and she did and that was alright. 

And just it's all so dumb cause I just puked cause all this shit is stressing me so much and it's just a HAIRCUT. I hate myself so much. Why am I like this? I hate having anxiety other people just go and get a haircut and I have been wanting my hair cut for a fucking month now and it's bothering me so much and I just can't do it and I told myself I am gonna call today and I just can't manage it ffs. All I managed is make myself absolutely miserable over a fucking haircut, maybe I should just give myself a buzzcut and call it a day and never bother with a fucking barber again"
674,Anxiety,OCD is the worst kind of anxiety disorder! Especially the intrusive thoughts kind it is so disturbing and debilitating,[removed]
675,Anxiety,Buzzing/vibrating in leg for days,"Ive been buzzing/vibrating in my leg for days now, every second. Its not like twitching, feels like something under like a phone calling. Really annoying and it makes my anxiety just worse.

Has anyone had the same? For days/weeks?"
676,Anxiety,Dealing with those awkward moments when a mutual acquaintance asks you about a person you had a falling out with yet they don’t know you had a falling out.,"
Like I don’t want to badmouth the person or speak ill will about them and id hope out of respect they wouldn’t do the same to me, but it makes me feel awkward when someone else mentions their name in my presence and it reminds me of our falling out.  Anyone been in those situations?"
677,Anxiety,Is there a point when Xanax stops working?,"I was diagnosed and medicated for a bit and then I felt like the the doctor wasn't a good fit for me so I stopped going for appointments or getting medicated. Its been months and things started getting bad again. I still have leftover medication,  Xanax, for emergencies. 

I haven't took one in quite a long time but I needed it today. It helped me sleep for a bit but the symptoms are starting again but it has only been 5 hours since I last took it. Usually it lasts me at least an entire night, gives me enough time to get in some physical exercise and breathing exercises to self regulate a little. 

I'm scared that the medicine might not be effective for me anymore. Does Xanax stop working after some point?

Ps, I don't drink, smoke, do other illegal drugs or consume any other medication except for my depression and anxiety."
678,Anxiety,Do I have anxiety?,"Before I start this, I know the best way to know is asking a doctor or a therapist but for personal reasons I can't really do that right now. 

With that being said, all my life I've been scared of doing new things, the first time i bought something at the store i could barely talk, the first time i went to highschool, the firt time i drove, the first time i moved out. Just doing these things would make me freeze almost as a kid, as i grow older its a lot easier to handle obviously. I've never thought about anxiety before at all because no one in my family really has it, or at least not to my knowledge.

It's only in recent years that I began to realise i might have anxiety, maybe not super high beause ive never had a panick attack (Well i have had 1 when i was really high but, I was really high soo, anyways. Now that I'm making friends and dating and talking more to people in general i'm starting to see why i've been this way all my life 

When I get a phone call, no matter who it is, the first few seconds when i know someone is calling, my heart skips a beat, I start sweating and then i get idk scared? It's hard to explain but hearing how others describe anxiety I think thats what it is 
I just get anxious 

Anyways, I posted this because I wanted to knoe if I was the only one like this? And if you guys think I might be anxious or something else or even just normal
I'm not asking for a diagnosis of course not, it's just that untill I see a professional I'd like to get an idea of what i might have before I see one 

You can also DM me if you want to talk about anything, Idk why you would but you can:)"
679,Anxiety,Does anyone experience a frequent urge the urinate while traveling because of anxiety?,"This happens to me again today, so I need to travel for 1-2 hours with two of my colleagues but my biggest problem is I constantly have the feeling that I needed to pee! but the worst is after I take a leak and get back to the car it happens again after a few minutes! I was kind of annoyed and embarrassed myself to my colleagues! this happens every so often, especially when I'm traveling for long hours."

682,Anxiety,Is this paranoia or anxiety?,"

Hi everyone,

I have a constant fear (which sometimes peaks and it becomes unbearable) that people my find out secrets about me and ruin my life by telling them.

It never actually happened to me but I always think that WHAT IF and start feeling extremey anxious.

In my childhood my mom would very often search my room or my laptop to find things about me and attack me with them few days later and I know now that that is the root of it.

But really what I need to know is, do people actually do this? Like use something you told only to them to ruin relationships or make people lose their jobs? 

I'm mainly afraid of men doing this in moments of angerness cause I lived surrounded by them all my life and they seem so unpresictable...

Also, whenever I find courage to confess myself to someone that I (at the moment) trust I get immediate thoughts that maybe the information might leak through them to others that we'll surely cause me harm with it.

I try to help myself with breathing techniques and meditation but it doesn't really work on the long run as long as the thought is still there.

It's so draining and hard cause in my head every situation seems real and valid and feels like I don't even get intimacy in my own head!"
683,Anxiety,moving forward with anxiety,"So i graduated a few months back, been job hunting for all that time. Now i finally got a job offer i am so anxious instead of happy. I am all new to the working enviroment, i am constantly in a state of worry. I whas so anxious these past days that i just wanted to decline but i dont wanna hang on my parents forever, i even managed to get some doomscenarios in my head. How do u get doomscenarios out of a job offer??"
684,Anxiety,do I not like him or is it just my anxiety?,"I (18F) have been in a relationship for a short time, about a month, with a guy (18M) from my class. I see him everyday due to school but I've hung out with him only twice, and both times I felt very very anxious. When I think about him or the fact that I have to see him I start feeling uneasy, anxious, my heart rate increases and I begin to panic. It is my first relationship ever (and also his first relationship) and it had a rough start, due to some people interfering causing a misunderstanding. I suffer from anxiety, and I've been seeing a therapist for almost a year
I think we moved too fast: although we knew each other already, we started talking and creating a bond only recently and I feel like we were both 'pushed' into this relationship. 
Sometimes I think I agreed to this relationship only because he's the first guy who has ever shown interest in me, and he's the only male that I know and that I consider 'eligible'. When I think about the future I don't really see each other together. Sometimes I even think that I don't really like him and that I'm selling myself short by being with him, that I could have someone better (but it's probably my narcissistic part talking). 
What should I do? Should I end things with him? Should I see where it goes? Should I explain how I feel to him?

First of all I’ve started therapy for my extreme stress and that I was kinda lost in life (university/work). So, for the past 4-5 months or so I CANNOT sit still to watch a damn movie or series. I constantly have to do something either draw,craft or be on and off my phone while “watching” a movie. I have to tho back minutes into the movie cause I am constantly zooming out.

689,Anxiety,Sertraline,"Hiya everyone - on day 2 of 25mg sertraline. I was put on it for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Yesterday was a great day, today aittle more anxious but manageable. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced the following and has any tips / tricks for getting over the beginning hump. 

* I do not want to go off these meds so please do not suggest that. Should I notice severe symptoms, yes, I will reach out to my doctor. This post is simply looking for tips people used to make the beginning stages aittle smoother *

1. I take mine at 7pm as my pharmacist recommended at night due to drowsiness. Night one I was drowsy with a little bit of anxiousness but overall was good. 2nd night, slightly drowsy but much more anxious and had a bit of a hard time getting to sleep. Any tips for this? 

2. Mornings seems a bit rough - feel quite jittery in the morning when I wake up and on edge. 

3.  Loss of appetite / very minimal nausea- I do notice that once I sit down and eat something though I feel a bit better, wondering if I should just force myself to eat something? Even if I'm not feeling hungry. 

So far, these are the only hiccups I'm having, please send any tips my way, greatly appreciate it!"
690,Anxiety,Anxiety and illness is ruining my life.,"Apologies for what might be a long read but I really need to vent somewhere and I’m hoping some of the things I write here will resonate with someone else. I am a 29 year old female and My anxiety began around 7 year ago when my second born child was around 1 years old. The first time I noticed it was a mild fluttering in my chest/throat that made me want to cough, about 3 weeks later I got first full blown panic attack, a few days later my second and then third, I was convinced I was dying these what I now know to be anxiety attacks manifested into feelings of a crushing headache, heart pounding, feeling like I was going to pass out and feeling like my vision was going to go. On one such episode I was rushed to hospital where they thought I had a bleed on the brain due to the severity of these attacks. I had to stay for 4 days and battery of tests later including scans and I was diagnosed with migraines and then later anxiety. 
It took me months to get on top of my symptoms but after a while they went away and life returned to normal, aside from the odd panic attack or weird fluttering in my throat life was good again. 
Fast forward to the past 18 months when symptoms of anxiety became severe again, panic attacks that made me so hot I wanted to throw off my clothes, constantly feeling unwell or like I was coming down with the flu. Nocturnal panic attacks that wake me covered in sweat and convinced I was having a heart attack. Heart palpitations multiple times a day. Neck pain and headaches all par for the course. Stomach symptoms, feeling dazed or like I’m going to pass out for no reason and tingling hands. Doctors ran a battery of yet again including ultrasounds, multiple rounds of blood work a colonoscopy for the stomach symptoms all absolutely fine I’m the picture of health apparently so why don’t I feel like it. Why am I constantly tired, fatigued feeling dazed and unwell at least 4 days out of 7? 
My doc tried me on some type of anxiety depression medication which I was allergic to and gave me serotonin syndrome that landed me in hospital. Probably one of the worse experiences of my life. 
At this point I’m feeling so hopeless and I’m convinced I’m either going crazy or that there is something seriously wrong with me. Can anxiety really be the cause of all those physically symptoms that feel so real? 

I have stopped socialising as much as I used to because the thought of this happening in public is so embarrassing not to mention that alcohol makes my anxiety so much worse. 

I am lucky that I am self employed so working a few days a week can afford me the income that I’d get working full time on the days I feel well. I’m also extremely privileged to have a supportive partner, children and family. 

I’m just so frustrated that the best years of my life are consumed by feeling so shit and weird. 

Please tell me I’m not alone in this thank you for reading x"
691,Anxiety,Quitting Lexapro,"Hi. I stopped taking Lexapro in January after being on it for about 10 years. Since then, I’ve been dealing with some weird problems that I think is related to me quitting.

My main problems have been tense neck, numbness/tension in my face and jaw, sometimes my face will feel hot and get red when drinking alcohol now, numbness in my left hand pinky and ring finger, cold feet, and vision problems and overall increased anxiety. I went to the eye doctor for floaters and she said that I do have them and that it’s normal.

I think my anxiety at this point is manifesting itself as health anxiety. I started off thinking I was having a heart attack. Then it was lymphoma or some type of cancer. Now it’s diabetes. I just had blood work done in January right before I quit and everything was apparently fine except for high cholesterol. 

Can anyone else like me that has quit Lexapro after taking it for a long time relate?  I’m wondering is my brain chemistry is still adjusting even after quitting over three months ago.  And by the way, I did taper for months ahead of quitting."
692,Anxiety,Heart palpitations when doing exams,"Hi everyone! So I started getting heart palpitations about a year or two ago and they really freak me out

However, I’ve concluded that they must be caused by anxiety because it happened to me today when I was doing a school exam! I know I’m not dying and it just makes me feel uncomfortable more then anything else but does anyone know how to stop them?

I’m a high achieving student and never got heart palpitations before when I’ve done other exams years ago, I think the anxiety’s only come on now

In addition to this I also get really hot a lot of the time

I know I’m not having a heart attack or anything because my dad has them too, so I think it’s genetic

One other thing to add is, I don’t actually feel anxious at all in my life, even going into the exam I feel calm and collective, it’s only once I start the exam my heart goes - but I don’t have the anxious feeling just the heart palpitations!

Any help on controlling my exam anxiety would be very much appreciated thank you!"
693,Anxiety,My anxiety is ruining my relationships,I feel like a misery to all my friends because of irritability and anxious antics.

694,Anxiety,Studying abroad and the sheer nervousness of the situation,"So if all goes according to plan, I'll be in a language school in another country. 

Admittedly, there's a part of me terrified. ""What if it's a bust"" ""what if the experience is terrible""

What doesn't help is that my family thinks everything is a scam. Some have never left our hometown because they think hotels, airplanes, etc are scams. 

Not sure how to process my feelings"
695,Anxiety,Do you use benzos?,"I use clonazepam 2mg daily for over a decade. I'm now using 3mg, and it's making me sleepy."
696,Anxiety,Being called “sweetie” or “hon” at work,"This happens a lot because I’m a receptionist and I try to keep my voice friendly. I don’t mind if it comes from coworkers (though it never does, they always call me by name). But when it comes from strangers it drives me up the wall. I’ll be anxiously seething for hours afterward. How do I defuse it, or do I just ignore it?"
697,Anxiety,I (F22) don’t feel safe in my car anymore. How do I either calm myself or convince my parents to buy me a new one?,"I am very fortunate and come from a financially stable family but we are by no means rich. I live at home with my amazing mom and dad who are very supportive of me. Two of our cars we purchased used with at least 70,000 miles on them and our other car we bought 15 years ago and has more than 150,000 miles on it. I drive a little Volkswagen Bug (discontinued😫). It’s a very cute car, it’s super easy to drive, and I get a lot of compliments on it so I love that. I am SO lucky that my parents provided this vehicle for me years ago when I started to drive. However, I recently started commuting on the freeway and if any of you live in Southern California you know that they are very busy and often dangerous. I am a good driver, but I have terrible anxiety and though I am getting it treated I just don’t want to drive this little car anymore because it feels like a tin can. Please don’t share any data regarding the safety of this car if you know anything about it because that will only trigger me. I would just like to focus on perhaps purchasing a new car for me that is bigger. My best friend’s mom is thinking of selling her Ford car which is really sleek, easy to drive, and higher off the ground and bulky which means for me that I would feel safe in it, and given that I’m going to be spending a lot more time on the freeway in the morning and afternoon (1 hr+) I would feel much more comfortable in a larger car. How do you think I should go about presenting this idea to my mom and dad?🫢

I want to emphasize that the kind of car does not matter to me, I’m not looking for something fancy at all. I just want something where I’m higher off the ground and feel safer if, God forbid, something were to hit my car.

701,Anxiety,Confronting neighbors about their dogs,"Last night my neighbors dog wouldn't stop barking and I didn't sleep at all. Same thing today. So I had to go over and talk to them and I am now so anxious I wouldve been better off trying to sleep with the barking dog. 
I hate that I had to go over at all and i know I sounded frustrated. I dont want any problems with them. And my anxiety immediately goes to worse case scenario that they may be bad people and try to hurt my dog. (I know that is ridiculous to even think about but I can't help it) 
I wish I could just be like a normal person and do something like this and not worry about it because in the grand scheme it's probably not a big deal to them. 
I can tell myself all that but it doesn't help or make me believe it anyways. 

Also just to provide context these dogs bark ALL THE TIME. They bark all day but usually chill at night but they have been barking at night as of late. This isn't like i complained the first time it happened. :/ I don't understand how people can just sit there while their dogs bark all night and not do anything about it. :("
702,Anxiety,How do I keep a structured life?,"I will quit high school and start to go to college. That will be very scary, but I really want to do this.

College will start in a couple of moments and I will quit this school any time now, but how do I keep structure in my life?

Instructed to take one hour before the flight. It’s a 5 hour flight. I am wondering what to expect? I had the worst panic/anxiety attack last time I was on a plane and literally got off- I couldn’t do it. I haven’t been on a plane since.

Will it completely knock me out?? And do you think it would be effective for the whole duration of the flight? Im always scared of withdrawal symptoms (I know that sounds ridiculous). 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks."

706,Anxiety,Ranting,I live with my boyfriend and his family and they were downstairs yelling and it’s triggered my anxiety so bad. I already am trying so hard to get myself back to functional and this place has been really good at triggering and making me feel unsafe; unfortunately right now this is the only living option available. I am looking into assistance programs to try and get out of here. It’s dysfunctional and I’m so fragile right now.
707,Anxiety,I really wanna get on the big rides at amusement parks…,"So, I’m headed to Dollywood in a couple of weeks with some college buds of mine and am really looking forward to hopefully get a chance to finally do something out of my comfort zone. However, I’ve had a long history with coasters and anxiety attacks and I don’t wanna embarrass myself in front of my friends. For example, a couple years back my mother took to me and some friends to Six Flags Over Georgia and up till actually getting there, I was dead set in my mind to actually get on something at least moderately intimidating. We get there, and my anxiety started to ramp up to the extreme. I told my mom I didn’t wanna ride, but my mom, knowing how badly I want to break this fear of coasters, forced me to wait in line anyway, once we got to the coaster station, I had a full on meltdown, at about 16 or 17 years old, so I basically looked like a big baby. Not one of my proudest moments, but a good example of what my anxiety does when I try to get on certain rides, and it’s really sad because I’m completely entranced by roller coasters, all kinds, they all look so cool and fun, but my dumb anxiety won’t let me just get on one. I’m also super sentimental and I always look back and think about all the memories I missed out on making with friends on roller coasters and I want them to stop. Someday I just wanna walk into an amusement park with no fear and just ride everything, maybe even travel the country to check out coasters all over the states like so many of my favorite YouTubers do, but I just can’t, at this point I don’t even know what’s stopping me. I’m super afraid of heights, but I know riding a coaster won’t kill me or anything as I’ve studied how most coasters work and how they have numerous failsafe mechanisms in play in case something goes wrong. I wanna slay this beast that’s been plaguing my mind since I was young so I can enjoy any amusement park without feelings of being left out or regret. I want to do all these things but my anxiety just won’t let me. I’ve had my milestones, getting on Rock and Roller Coaster at Hollywood Studios was a big one for me, and just as I expected I ended up loving it, and now it’s one of my favorite rides, same with the Hagrid motorbike coaster at universal, so I’m more likely to enjoy these roller coasters than I am to have anything bad happen, yet I can’t pinpoint what’s stopping me from riding them. If anyone has any advice for me, I’d greatly appreciate it, I want to enjoy everything at Dollywood with my friends, not just spend my time waiting outside for them to get off. Has anyone else had similar experiences? Any advice will do really, I’m just sick and tired of being a huge fan of something I can’t even do in person."
708,Anxiety,Has anyone been on mood stabilizers for anxiety?,I’m currently on seroquel and remron but hoping to get off them.

709,Anxiety,Anxiety at an all time high,My anxiety has gone from bad to the worst it’s ever been in my life. I’m constantly paranoid about everything bad that could possibly happen. I’m constantly worried I’m wasting my time and that I’m not doing what I should be doing. I never feel relaxed or rested. I’m always overthinking every single little thing. I hate it. I know it’s all irrational and that none of these things matter. I see posts all the time about how overthinking isn’t the answer and that you need to just not stress about stuff you can’t control. Yet I’m not able to turn it off. It just gets louder until it’s all that I can hear.

So I started increasing the dose, and each increase I felt better. So then I thought bout it and realized the past few years the symptoms I noticed I was having were weird skin lesions and other skin issues, intense diarrhea (ik gross but it's true) as well as anxiety, depression, and even some brain fog.

It gets very depressing as night falls with me  staring at the wall in bed and running scenarios of easiest way to end life or praying for a health concern leading to a quick death. I don’t feel love;   happiness is something I don’t know anymore; if I’m at public places I just keep wondering how others are happy ?

I finally find my mental health  as a disability as it’s stopping me from doing anything, I avoid meeting friends, or talking to anyone. However, what I fail to understand is that when I’m around people,  my brain/body goes into a different psyche where internally I have a voice eating my brains out with negative thoughts, but I’m carrying on intense conversations and i’m in the zone to an extent nobody realizes I’m off. It’s like having two people living in the same body playing tug of war with me feeling trapped and wanting out. 

I’m sorry if all the above is gibberish - but if someone is/has faced this or at least knows what this condition might be- please share in the comments. Although I don’t want anyone to suffer like me, I’m sure I can’t be the only one with this mental imbalance. 

Also I’ve severe financial anxiety to an extent where I just cant spend money. It triggers me and still I do live well and have more than enough. But still I regret everything, I feel everything is futile  and even at 33yrs I feel I have missed the bus, haven’t done shit in life and that it’s too late.  My dad at 60 has more zeal and love for life than me and that too after seeing massive lows in his life. 

This is affecting my relationship with everyone esp my spouse ( who is really kind and understanding but I feel l’m ruining her life), my parents who have no clue about this or my friends. The irony is no one even knows me. They know me as someone who is social, friendly and a party animal and so if I have shared this with them that I suffer depression they just shrug it off and say I’m just trying to be cool. This has made me move away from them as honestly being happy takes a big toll on me. It’s a huge mental effort to stay happy and behave like a normal person and I always come back exhausted after a social gathering."
721,Anxiety,When to tell him that I’m bipolar?,"There’s this guy that I really like. I can tell he likes me. However, I’m wondering if and when I should tell him? We’re not dating, but we could be. Like I said, I can genuinely tell he likes me. 

When should I tell him? I’m worried that if I tell him too soon, I’ll scare him off. If I tell him too late, he’ll be angry with me for keeping it from me. For me in particular, I’m relatively high functioning. I can go to school, and have a customer service job with little stress. However, it’s when I’m alone that I unleash my true self. I try not to do anything too destructive when I have manic episodes. For example, the most I’ll do is sing and walk down the street in the middle of the night. But I also know that I’d be asking a lot of him because I’m bipolar. He’ll have to take care of me a lot of the time, and be extra patient."
722,Anxiety,Contamination fear? Overthinking?,"Stupid health anxiety ?? Sorry 😕
We’re at my friend’s who’s other friends have been known to do drugs… he doesn’t really hang out with that guy anymore. 

Basically I dropped a piece of candy on the table and I remembered one of them did coke on a plate on the table because we stumbled upon the aftermath….

I blew it off and atr. Don’t think there’s ever been any drugs in that spot but IDK?

I might just be really high with weed cuz it’s potent 😕"
723,Anxiety,Need some advice and opinions 🎁,"In 2018 in High school I had a really tight group of friends, 4 of us. These people all stopped being my friend by the end of that year when we graduated. I was a compulsive liar back then and this started impacting my friendships and relationships quite a bit. Let’s call one of the friends Megan. Megan’s departure from my life impacted me the most as it was really sudden and unexpected. I had no idea that she was seriously considering ending the friendship. Fast forward 3 years later and every time I hear about her I become an anxious mess just thinking back to what I could have done differently and how perhaps she would’ve still been my friend. This is something I have struggled to accept over all these years, that it’s over and that it’s okay. Last week, Megan got back from travelling overseas and we now happen to have some mutual friends so we ended up meeting twice in the same week at parties. 

My issue is that every waking second i’m obsessing about our interactions, wondering how I was perceived and will she want to be my friend now that I’ve changed etc etc. I sleep and it’s good and then I wake up and I’m back to compulsively thinking about what she thinks of me. Another important point is that she is friends with my ex and i worry that Megan’s judgement could be clouded by her. Also, Megan told me herself in the past week when we briefly talked that it’s hard to give me the benefit of doubt, knowing what kind of person I was before. 

I know it’s completely irrational but that gets to me a lot because I’ve spent 3 years becoming a better person and I want her to just somehow know. My current partner tells me that I shouldn’t even care what she thinks but I just can’t get out of this loop that i’m in. This translates into my life a lot, I always want everyone to like me and understand me.

I get in a very bad way when thinking about this topic because I miss our friendship so so much and I just need some tips on how to alleviate some of this bizarre thinking."
724,Anxiety,Feeling out of touch with reality lately,Ive been having an extremely hard time staying present lately. Negative thoughts are constantly flooding my mind and i always feel like an idiot.

I dont want to feel like this anymore its awful.

726,Anxiety,"Today is my year’s Easter celebration assembly, how do I survive if I’m called up","I’m new to this sub and to explain, every last week in a full term, we have a celebration assembly.

The last time we had an in person celebration assembly was December 2019, and most of the others have just been on virtual apps.

Today, we have an in-person assembly and I feel like the world will end if I get called up. I told my form tutor if I could just not get called up, but either way, I feel like they are gonna know and have to call me up, and it would probably more embarrassing."
727,Anxiety,Does anyone else constantly dream about the future,Whenever I’m bored or I’m anxious (which is 90% of the time) I escape the present by making fake scenarios In my head that make me feel happy/excited/hopeful.

729,Anxiety,Advice needed,"I’ve suffered with insomnia for many years which i imagine had been due to my anxiety. Having recently trained myself to fall asleep with relative ease I’m finding myself wake up in the early hours freezing cold and drenched in sweat.

730,Anxiety,Interview in a few hours.. trying to keep calm but I can feel an anxiety attack coming,"Basically, I have a job which truly brings me a lot of sadness, anxiety and stress.

I have recently started a childcare course, and we need to do some hours at a center.

I applied last Friday at this center and they called me a few hours later, the interview is today.

I both want and need this job. I deeply want to follow my dream and have a job I truly love, plus I want to give in my 4 week notice at the other job ASAP because I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I do not have experience in childcare, which is scaring me the most.

Do you guys have any tips for me please? I know I would make a great carer, I just don't know how to express that."
731,Anxiety,Ohhhhhhh anxiety,"I absolutely worn out this point I can’t sometimes I’m genuinely scared that I’m dying I can’t put my mind on other things to distract myself I used to spend hours on my console playing whatever, killing time now I spending it being hyper aware of each and ever body functio. chest pain that can be caused by all sorts of things feels like my heart is pumping needles and it could Be having a heart attack I’ve gone to the er for this before nothing was wrong. I’ve been taking hydroxyzine which I wanna say helps I get sleepy and sometimes that’s what I need but i also get chest pain on it and messes up my whole situation it’s supposedly a side affect but it just makes the medication useless to me. This is just a rant I don’t expect any responses I just need to get out of me but if there is someone out there with similar issues you are not alone"
732,Anxiety,What is this? (also a bit of a vent),"So for a long time now I've been planning on seeing a mental health professional about some of the things I've been experiencing. But before then I want to know what my issue might be. I'm not self-diagnosing or anything, but it's just to have an idea of what the issue might be before confirming it with a professional so we can have a place to work from. For the most part, I've suspected that I might have dysthymia and an anxiety disorder of some sort. The anxiety and dysthymia have always been obvious things to me and people around me so that's nothing new.

However, after a lot of self-reflection and thinking, I've recently realized another tendency I have. I've always been afraid of what people thought of me. I would constantly worry about what others thought and whether or not they were judging me, and I would be too scared to hurt someone else because I didn't want them to see me as a bad person. I would do things to appeal to other people and change myself to suit what that person wanted or expected from me. I still have those tendencies, if not stronger than before, but back then I had a group of friends that I trusted and relied on and felt that I could be somewhat natural around so I slowly adopted an ""I don't care"" mindset to tackle those behaviours. 

But ever since a major life event happened in my life, I feel like those things have only gotten worse. My fear of being judged has made me subconsciously block people out the moment they want to get to know me on more than just a surface level, so I've found it difficult to make friends. I have a friend group I'm a part of but it's only a few people, and yet I am still scared of fully opening up to them. I don't know if they know I probably wouldn't and have just accepted that part of me regardless, or they are just putting up with me, but they aren't too pushy about things like that so I appreciate it. I undermine myself a lot, a lot of self-reflection has made me realize that I pretty much hate myself and see myself as, to the point that I've noticed how much I prioritize other people's wellbeing over mine. The moment I feel like I messed up a connection with someone, I instantly feel like leaving the whole city because I just think ditching the whole thing and never meeting that person again would be much better than fixing their image of me.  

The ""trying to mould myself to suit others"" part has only gotten worse, a recent experience proved that to me. Now I would never tell lies about myself or indulge in things like doing drugs, and spending money, I don't do that because of how I was raised. But it's mostly me changing my personality?. So long story short, I started living with someone who expected me to be a certain way, but I didn't meet those expectations at all, I started getting anxious and tried to fit myself into that image but I just couldn't, to the point that I dreaded being around this person and even had physical reactions to being around them (physically shaking, randomly crying, heart palpitations, feelings of depersonalization? it only happened a few times, it felt like I wasn't with them when we are talking or like I was reliving a memory, a sudden feeling of dread, etc). It's not the first time that I've not been able to meet someone's expectations, but I think the difference between the few other times and now was that I was literally living with this person, so I couldn't avoid them as I would usually do and I just ended up overreacting.

I eventually left the place but that whole experience really got to me, and now I've been avoiding them because I go to the same church as they do and I'm scared of meeting them. Because of that, I ended up not going to church for 4months straight before I realized it. And when I did I started worrying about how everyone probably thinks I've ditched them, or I'm just lazy or irresponsible. The thought of them asking questions and them having a negative image of me scared me so much that I ended up not going for another 4months before gathering the courage to go twice. But after that, I ended up not going again and that was over 6months ago. Now it's more of a mixture of, I'm worried and I also don't have the tiniest bit of energy to interact with people. 

The one thing that worries me the most is that because of my fears, I tend to endure things that I don't feel comfortable with. I've had interactions with a friend for instance where I didn't like what they did, but because I didn't want the person to see me as a bad person or to think I was trash or smth, I just endured some of their behaviours and ignored it. And my close friends have pointed out this tendency to me and are getting really worried too. And that worries me, because I'm scared that if I ever get into a toxic or even worse, an ab\*sive relationship in the future, it might be very difficult for me to get out of it because of how anxious I get. I don't know what this is, and I'm really hoping I can see a professional soon to address it, I don't know if you guys might have an idea of what this is. Please leave your thoughts if you can, and sorry for the long essay."
733,Anxiety,Diazepam Vs Temazepam,"My doctor prescribed me 8 x 10mg pills of Valium for panic attacks which is clearly not enough this is the letter I’m writing to my psychiatrist, what are your thoughts? Is there anything you would change?

And I think temazepam would be the right drug for me because of insomnia and anxiety and diazepam is ineffective for me 

-

Personally I think switching to temazepam would help more as Valium is causing side effects (headaches and nausea) and not helping at all

The dose (10mg) is not enough and I can’t feel it with my tolerance so I think the maximum dosage of temazepam 40-60mg would help my anxiety because I have a large tolerance to benzodiazepines (was taking 10-20mg of clonazepam for a while) and diazepam is causing me side effects and not effective in dealing with my anxiety. I think switching to temazepam 2-3 times a week would really help because I’ve had a very stressful time recently and that way I wouldn’t gain dependence

I haven’t take quetapitine yet due to worries with my recently diagnosed brugada syndrome in which certain antipsychotics are not good to take"
734,Anxiety,Does anyone else have a disabled family member?,"My mum is physically disabled, in pain daily, and I think that's been the main cause of my anxiety. I remember waking up to her crying and screaming in pain when I was a kid, it was horrible. I remember ambulances coming to the house late at night. You always have to be on your toes around her because she's so sensitive to pain."
735,Anxiety,I don’t feel too good,"Lately, I feel awful. My hair is a perpetual mess that ignores products and has only one purpose in like that is to defy gravity. 

My face is full of acne marques, I have very pronounced dark circles. I look super exhausted.

I’ve gained weight and my stomach looks awful since my surgery. I have no idea wth they did to my belly button but it looks awful.

I’m so very anxious and stressed. Some other moments very depressed.

My whole body hurts, my stomachs hurts, my head hurts, my joints hurts. I feel super tired and weak. 

I can’t seem to fall asleep without mixing medication. 

I have so much on my plate right now… and nothing that I can’t do about it… I’ve did my part and now I can only wait for results. 

I feel like my body is completely out of whack. 

I’m scared to go back to work.

I wish something would progress and allow me to take better care of myself. I can’t go on like this. I don’t want to feel miserable like this 😢"
736,Anxiety,I am losing hope. (Vertigo),"Certain I've had it for about 2 years now, and I'm currently consulting Neurologist every month for the past year. Been giving me anti-anxiety meds, betahistine, antidepressants which help with the panic attacks, but the dizziness has been coming and going. I've consulted an ENT, got my blood chem, ECG, lung X-ray, ENT CT scan (I'm taking nasal sprays for rhinitis).

I've also tried going to a chiropractor which didn't really make a difference despite having cool crackly sounds. I don't even remember how many doctors I've been to, but I'm shooting my shot whether someone has experienced the same thing. It's been bothering my social life and career. I've lost some friends because of not being able to show up due to my constant dizziness. Is it stress from work? I'm a video editor and I don't really work like typical editors do. I work 9 hrs a day (or less) and that's about it.

Despite that I am very active. I skateboard everyday for 2 hrs. 

IDK why I'm posting here either, just shooting my shot if ever someone has the same story as I have.

Thank you"
737,Anxiety,First day of holiday and having a panic attack,"I just finished 18 hours of flying to Europe and vomited twice on the flight over, I’m not sure if this is because of anxiety or air sickness, but I have now been off the plane for 3 hours and I still feel nausea which is making me panic.

738,Anxiety,My birthday yesterday 3/28,"Sorry this is just going to be a ramble and bunch of thoughts.

I couldn’t sleep so I was watching Netflix show, then I just started thinking about everyone who reached out and said happy birthday and those who didn’t. I thought about friends not in touch anymore. How we could have stayed in touch. Do i even have friends? Relationships broken. Then I just started crying, like did I enjoy my b-day? questioning my existence. feel like i havent cried in a while and it all came out. 

Also went to a funeral for the first time last week it just gave me such a weird feeling. Meeting someone for the first time in a decade and it’s at a funeral. Never seen him like that, in shambles cuz of his wife’s death. I kept thinking about her in the casket. how would i be seen when i die and wtf am i doing w my life rn. Will I find someone to build a family with. I want kids I want someone i want to spend my life with. i feel so lonely.

My grandma also fell and broke her hip so she had surgery two days ago. Thought about how i would feel if the surgery didnt go well. If it would even go well at all. The surgery did go well. But like now im thinking if she would recover quickly. Idek i hope she does and fully. 

I am such a fucking mess. Just needed to unload… and i didnt know where/who to go to"
739,Anxiety,"I don’t know whats going on with me, my life and my mind…","

Well, i am not expect that it’s gonna help me mentally, but this post probably could help me in emotional way, sometimes it’s feels so good to be heard out and have a side of support, and reddit could be a proper place where you can find it that, i think many can agree. The thing, why i am writting this, is because i just simply don’t know what’s going in my life and with my well-being. To me it seems that i have plenty symptoms of various disorders, recently i started to feel spaced out or zone out, i think people here know those terms very well, it’s something like that, when you’re watching at something, but actually u don’t, no object, just your mind take you up somewhere in the clouds, and just lose a touch with reality. This is not the end of the line guys, my self-estem below regular, if someone would say me something sensetive and touchy, i would not mind that, at all, seems i lost my natural feeling of angriness, but anyway i would react, but not because of the feeling, but because i know how i should to “act” when someone disrespect you, but no feelings only fake out, weird, it haven’t happened before, unless i do not remember of my poor memory, my memory also started going downhill ant it is give me a big anxiety. And anxiety always been a big part in my life, the last time when i felt calm and relaxed at the chilhood, from 14 i started suffering suicidal depression, and after one year it slipt away, and actually it doesn’t it’s just owergrown in anxiety disorder ant later on panic attacks i use to have them everyday day also for one year, so right i guess i a new stage, my mind just exausted and tired of everything what was happened from 14 until now i am 20 years old i suffer a long-term misery, at this point, my mind can't create correct sentences, the only thing i can really say when anyone asks me whats wrong is 'i don't know' i really don't know. in that state, i can't think of anything but i don't know. sentences, thinking, logic, it all just hurts my mind more. No energy, no thoughts or my thougts flowing very fastly that i can’t even catch them, none of them they aren’t processable. I think i still suffer depression and i also guess that i started to experience spiritual awakening, i started to see and sense the other people energy, still i can’t explain, but those people who are sleep and just care about the earthly material and all they care is money, they talk nonsense and they just robbering my vitality, i have no energy mentally and physically to perform any sort of task. When i am writting this my minds feels literally overlouded with something and i just don’t know how to put everything correctly in the words, because my problem seems much higher and bigger. At least im out of my comfort zone, i was overstayed in my house for 5 months, now i left not just my house but also the country, it is also possibly has some effect to me, i need time to adjust, but those 5 months didn’t added me any value, all that time i were pleasing myself with porn. How i feel now? Want to be alone, or just want to be understanded at least maybe because of that i want to feel alone, because i don’t know if somwehere is a right person. And in the all i wanted to say that this world sometimes feels unreal, i am looking at this world and honestly i just don’t believe it’s happening.  in general i don’t know who causing me this condition and i think thats all, i will apreciate any back comment."

741,Anxiety,What does your therapy look like?,"I've been going to therapy for almost a year now and have seen two different people, but both experiences have been similar. I've gotten a lot of tips and tricks, really built up a toolkit, but it feels wrong in a way? Like the way I'm doing this is helping, but also not. It's kind of like ""Great, I can work on my anxiety, but we don't even know why I have anxiety.""

I know therapy isn't like what we see in movies. I also know you get out what you put in. I've expressed that there are things in my past I struggle with and need some help getting closure on, but it seems like all I'm getting out of it is ""We will try to fix this current problem and send you on your way."" I've tried to be upfront but I don't think we're getting into the meat of things. It's almost like I'm getting better so they don't want to pick off a scab to reveal a wound.

I hear about other people who go to therapy and talk about pretty much whatever. Like if something bad happened that week, they bring it up to get help working through it if needed. That sounds more beneficial to me to almost discuss things as they come up while working on the persistent issues. It makes me feel like I'm getting the wrong type of therapy maybe.

What happens (loosely of course) in your sessions?"
742,Anxiety,DAE have noise anxiety?,"I’ve been sensitive to sudden and loud noises since I’ve been a kid. Automatic toilets, hand dryers, vacuum cleaners, fireworks, and blenders (to name a few) have always been extremely anxiety-inducing for me and give me that fight or flight feeling. However, I can perfectly handle things like a loud concert or a busy street, and my hearing isn’t that sensitive otherwise. Does anyone else relate?"

746,Anxiety,"I don’t think I’m pretty enough, and I’m okay marrying the guy that tried to rape me","A year and a half ago, a guy tried to take advantage of me. I was drunk in a bar, and he got me a water. Thirty minutes later, I was unable to walk or move. When getting escorted back to my room, he tried to stay with me, but another guy prevented him from doing so. I’m pretty sure he roofied me. I’ve always known what his intentions were, but I’m not turned off by what he did. 

If anything, I have feelings for him. No other guy has liked me that way before. Maybe there have been other guys who liked me, but none have ever been so overt about their interest in me. We’re still social media friends, and my hope is that we can get married and live happily ever after together. Another thing that didn’t help was that at the same time, a guy that I really liked had a girlfriend. He kept the fact that he had a girlfriend from me, and I was so disappointed. So I redirected my feelings for my crush onto this other guy. I feel like my original crush didn’t fight hard enough for me. Isn’t that what love’s all about? Fighting for someone, even when it’s difficult? 

Given how confident he was with me, he likely has done what he did to me before. It disgusts me if he has done it to other girls, but he did tell people that I was the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, so hopefully he only does bad stuff to me. I admit, I’m a virgin, never had a boyfriend before either. I want to have sex so bad. I know he’ll likely hurt me really bad, but he said that I’m the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen. He told mutual friends this. 

I want to get married to him and be financially dependent on him. I want to be pregnant with his children, and have lots of babies with him. Knowing what I know about him, he has some abusive tendencies, but not to worry. I won’t let him hurt our babies. I’ll redirect his anger and frustrations on me. No one has ever loved me before, and he’s the best I can do. I don’t want anyone else, just him. I know it’s likely that he may end up killing me. But I’ve been really depressed for years, and my one goal in life is to have children, so as long as my early death happens after I have children, I’ll be okay with that. 

I know it’s wrong. I know I should be disgusted by what he did. If a friend told me this happened to her, I’d tell her to run for the hills. But I don’t know. I’m 21 years old, and no guy has ever expressed any interest in me before. I want to get married and have babies, and if it means getting married to a monster, so be it. I can learn to love him, and he can learn to love me."

749,Anxiety,Very scared of losing my mind - need support,"Hey everyone, 

I am currently dealing with my relapse of anxiety and panic attacks. I have a pretty bad depersonalisation that pretty consistent for the past 2 months. I saw my therapist yesterday and he assured me that I don't have any signs of having schizophrenia or something like that. But my intrusive thoughts are so bad that I question my own memory. I ended up saying like, is this really happening? What if this is not real? I know it is real in a way cause it makes me terrified thinking that. I am not in a delusional space that I don't know what is real or not but also I am? I think I also have OCD cause I keep checking myself like make sure I hear a noise that is already there. My dog reacts to a noise as well and I say yes I actually heard it and it is real. Then I get panicky again because I need to check it to be able to say it is real and that to me is a sign of schizophrenia. You see the cycle here.... 

I literally don't trust my memory anymore cause everyday in a way is same. Waking up with anxiety and sleeping with anxiety. I am about to start my dream job in a month and I am so scared that I am gonna fuck it up. I am gonna end up questioning my reality. Even when I got the job the next day I woke up and said wow I can't believe I got this job, feels unreal. And had a panic attack because I thought about thinking that it feels unreal. I don't know if I am making any sense. This is suppose to me the happiest days of my life yet I am in this cloud, constantly questioning my sanity. Anxiety is shit. Please comment if you have symptoms like I do so I can have a little bit of relief."
750,Anxiety,Always think of worst-case scenario,"I'm planning on making a major life decision by accepting a teaching job in Vietnam. I've been there before, but that was 6 years ago. Some bad things happened last time. I ended up in a workplace that had cliques and I was isolated. I was bullied. I was in a relationship, but I was ghosted. I became an alcoholic. I became depressed. I could go on. My mind can't stop overthinking and imagining worst case scenarios. It's causing a lot of unneeded stress and anxiety in addition to suicidal thoughts. Here are some of the scenarios my mind is going through:

**Fact: It's past the deadline to make a decision for a job and the employer hasn't responded to my questions (some of which is my attempt to negotiate).** My mind: They're ghosting me or pressuring me into accepting their terms. If this job fails, I'm not going to be able to find another one because there's only a limited amount of reputable companies bring over teachers.

**Fact: I'll have to ride a motorbike 30-40min to work in Vietnam traffic (if my negotiations fail).** My mind: I'm going to die. Or, I'm going to hate my commute. It'll rain and I'll just get a taxi or a Grab anyway. Then at some point I'll end up a fatality statistic.

**Fact: I'm likely going to be offered drinks by colleagues/friends.** My mind: I'm on medication, and if I use that excuse not to drink in a country with a big drinking culture, I'm not going to have friends like last time. I'll be the black sheep and not part of the clique. Or if I drink, I'll have to stop my meds for depression, and I'll just kill myself or become super depressed and end up failing again and going home broke.

**Fact: There are big cockroaches in Vietnam and some of them entered my apartment last time I was in the country. I'm afraid of them (when they enter my apartment.)** My mind: I'm going to have to sleep in the one-man collapsable tent that I bought for the sole purpose of being safe from bugs. I'll have to sleep with the lights on. Whatever apartment I decide on, the landlord is going to lie about there not being an infestation.

**Fact: I was ghosted in my first and only relationship while I was over there. It hurt like hell, but I deserved it.** My mind: I'm just going to become needy like last time and end up pushing someone away. I'll overinvest early in the relationship. I'll get hurt again in the same way. Then, I'll become resentful and end up on bad subreddits like last time.

How do I stop ruminating, overthinking, and thinking of the worst-case scenario regarding this? I am so tired from overthinking. I just want my mind to stop."
751,Anxiety,Need help,"I fear criticism so much so that I start feeling breathless before every meeting at work place. I don't really know what to do. My hands get cold and I can barely move.

Someone please help me out I'm tired of being this way. I always try to be strong but end up all broken up before meeting. 
Not that I actually get criticism, but even the possibility of it haunts me at night."
752,Anxiety,Anxious because of job,"My work here is much more demanding then any work I have ever done. I received a warning for my performance and she gave me 2 weeks to prove myself. I am doing the best I can to do just that, but I feel constantly anxious. I am very scared of losing this job. She even told me that she is an inpatient person that cannot tolerate mistakes. I've been at this job for 1 month only and I don't want to go back to job searching."
753,Anxiety,coping with anxiety at work,"I have been suffering with severe GAD and MDD for the oast 1.5 years. I have a job but am struggling to keep it. 
I can feel myself tense and get worked up over a task or a meeting. I sm exhausted with sweating, air hunger, headaches, tense muscles and at the end of the day, even if I don't do much, I'm so tired that I can't even move a muscle. I don't take medication. I exercise and meditate. Please let me know any tips to cope with this."
754,Anxiety,How to deal with medicine side effects?,"I have been taking 20mg of paroxetine (seroxat) daily since december and I have found it difficult to fall asleep at night due to lots of energy and I wake up tired and not wanting to leave bed. Because of this I have started to take 2.5 mg of valium to help me fall asleep and in the morning in order to wake up, I need more than just a coffee, I have started to drink an energy drink so I can ""wake up"". I want to avoid taking this in order to do trivial things in life. How can I cope with the medicine side effects?"
755,Anxiety,What is like to feel anxious 24/7 ?,"I used to be anxious in certain situations because of social anxiety. Now, I am anxious 24/7. 

I feel paralyzed and unable to take a break from anxiety for days. 

Please tell me your experience, and any ways you use to stop the anxiety, even for an hour."
756,Anxiety,I really thought that having a cold bath would somehow lessen my anxiety,"Took a long cold bath hoping that all my worries would ease up ‘cos I’ve been feeling uneasy the whole day. I feel like I’m panicking and having trouble breathing. Feels like I can’t really help myself. Also had the thought again to end things but snapped back ‘cos I don’t want to leave my partner behind and face all of the responsibilities I’m leaving behind. 😪 I really don’t know what to do anymore.

I’ve been posting for so many times already (I think) I hope I can just put myself in a box because I’m really not feeling good anymore. And don’t want to be a burden to anybody

I’m not really making any sense here.."
757,Anxiety,I don't know what else to do and feeling hopeless,"I exercise 3 times a week and even when I don't, I always go for a 40-45 minute walk every day.

I read some books on different psychology topics, they were helpful but of course it's not that they will magically make anxiety and dpdr disappear, and they all seemed a bit too much superficial.

I am doing mindfullness every day almost (maybe I can work on quality and duration).

I have always had a good diet, never drink coffee, alcohol or other drugs.

Been on therapy for 1 year and it feels just a waste of money.

I am starting to feel hopeless, I don't know what more I can do, I'm sick of just surviving and fighting always with this bs symptoms. What have I even done to deserve this?"

759,Anxiety,Anxiety from overthinking,"Hey guys. I need some advice on how to not care what others think of me. I waste all my energy daily on trying to figure out if people are mad at me…etc. This typically happens at work daily but recently it has made its way into my interactions with my family. For example, if my sister doesn’t  text me back for a couple days, my mind starts racing about what I may of done to make her mad or why she may not want to talk to me. Another recent example of how it’s effecting my family life, my mother invited me to go to the store with her to shop and I said no because I was not feeling the best and I beat myself up about it all day long thinking I made her mad and it got to the point where I got emotional, broke down and apologized for saying no! I don’t understand why I’m like this. I try to tell myself that people have lives and just because they may not be overly friendly to me at work..etc, doesn’t mean I did something wrong to them! Does any one else deal with this type of anxiety? Sometimes I make myself go into a full blown panic attack with racing thoughts of what I did to these people to make them mad at me (even though they aren’t even mad at me in the slightest!) help!"
760,Anxiety,Can't eat due to being out of my comfort zone,"So, I started a new job yesterday and after being in a job where I felt super comfortable with the work and people for 4 years, I'm way out of my comfort zone. My anxiety levels are so high, they haven't been this high for a long time and due to this I can't seem to eat anything because I feel really nauseous.

I'm quite thin anyway so I can't afford to lose any more weight.

I keep telling myself this feeling will pass. It's just because my surroundings are new and I don't know anyone.

Has anyone else been in a similar situation? What was your experience?"
761,Anxiety,"I've inhaled drain cleaner ""smoke"" when I was putting it into the siphon. Physically, nothing happened and I'm fine, but it triggered a massive panic attack in me as I'm hypochondric.","The panic lasted for I guess an hour or so. Now, as I'm kinda calmed down, I just feel drained, exhausted without energy, like having a flu. Funnily enough, my back hurts out of a sudden, which can be a consequence of having a panic attack as I've read. I just want to lie down in bed and sleep, and do nothing. 

I'll skip classes today though. Just wanted to share that with you, maybe you'll know what to tell me what I should do. I'm thinking about getting some CBD as there's a shop 5min next to me.

Kind of feel like BoJack Horseman when he was driving through America after he suffered a panic attack on the set when he was doing the new Horsin Around show after Sarah Lynn died."
762,Anxiety,What physical symptoms did you get from constant anxiety?,I recently developed constant health anxiety and have felt numerous physical symptoms which worries me even more and the cycle doesn’t stop. Just wondering what physical symptoms did you guys get from anxiety and how did you stop your anxiety from manifesting?
763,Anxiety,It seems like progress has been made✨✨,"I've been afraid of social situations for the last 4 years and it became worse due to the lockdowns!! BUT rn I've survived through 2 weeks of physical school and I'm also a month sh clean!! VERY proud of myself and glad I've been trying to get better!!

I've also been trying to get better with my anxiety around food intake and my body image!! Not really doing the best with that one but issokayyyy!!

I've made a good amount of friends in school and i also managed to get invited for a movie AHHHHH it's exciting, scary but still exciting!! 

Ive been trying to be patient and understanding with myself, my body and mind!! I'm understanding my patterns, triggers and moods!! I wish I had access to a good professional but I'm too scared of them after my last experience and i think I'm gonna take my own time with that :) 

I hope everyone here is doing well too!! Remember that you're strong enough and I'm always here of anyone needs someone to talk to :)"
764,Anxiety,How do you guys earn an income?,I need an income but I get overwhelmed even by low stress jobs. Am I just fucked?
765,Anxiety,Anxious about my commute due to road rage,"I'm sorry in advance for the length of this post! So just for some context I am based in the UK and changed jobs a few months ago and my new commute just seems to be full of angry drivers.

In the last 2 weeks alone I've been yelled at at traffic lights and antogonised by someone after I'd honked my horn because they overtook me dangerously. I would not say I'm the best driver in the world or that I've never made a mistake while driving but I do my best to leave good gaps and not be reckless or dangerous. Anytime I have done something stupid it has just been a mistake with no malice behind it and I will happily admit to my mistakes. 

Today was the worst incident so far. I was at a roundabout turning left at the first exit, there was a car who was in the right hand lane coming around the roundabout. For this car to leave at the next exit (the same one I wanted to use) you'd need to be in the left hand lane or at least indicating to go into that lane. Since they were doing neither of these things I pulled out. They then merged into the left lane and honked at me. I admit they had to brake fairly hard so I flashed my hazard lights as an apology, I truly didn't believe they were using the same exit as me. They preceeded to hold down their horn and were inches from my back bumper. I was near work so I turned off toward my gated workplace and  they followed, I assumed we worked at the same place. I scanned my card to get through the barriers and noticed them turning around to leave. I realised at that point that they must have gone that way just to follow me.

 I am now full of so much anxiety what if they come back after I leave work to yell at me or something? What if I run into them again and they recognise me?
I truly didn't mean to inconvenience them, it was a mistake and I think could have happened to anyone, and just thinking I might get verbally assaulted or worse for making an error on the road is just making me feel so anxious. 

TLDR: After a near miss on the road a driver followed me to work but turned around without doing anything and now I'm nervous about driving my commute."
766,Anxiety,Im pretty terrified right now,"My brother goes outside very often and he is 9 years old.
He's been having a fever for two days now , and today he woke up with difficulty to swallow juice and a bad neck pain.
There is a lot of wild dogs where I live so I am really afraid he has picked up rabies , but my mother (who is a pharmacist) keeps insisting he will be fine.
I used to get a fever like that as a kid but I am really worried for my brother."
767,Anxiety,How can I stop the “What-if” scenarios in my brain from ruining my day? Why do they pop up all the time.,
768,Anxiety,Sertraline side effect,"So I (21M) started a course of sertraline tablets (50mg) just over 2 weeks ago, and I have been having a big increase in long, well ""sustained"" erections. The usual side effects of sertraline says that difficulty getting it up and actually cuming is common, and yes one of those is true as it does take a long time to reach orgasm, however I can't seem to find any other text on other people having the opposite side effect to trouble with getting a hard on. It doesn't take anything to set it off, it's rock solid and really sensitive, and can sometimes last 40mins to an hour. 

Don't know if its something I should be worried about or if it's just a natural side effect given the drug changing my brain chemistry. Mainly making the post to make sure I've not got some weird 1 in a million side effect."
769,Anxiety,Need help regard psychiatrist,"I visited a psychiatrist 10 days ago. I thought I had Adhd we talked barely ten minutes and she gave some meds and tests to get done. Test were Adhd and MCMI. I did test with psychologist she refered. They were questionnaire. So no Adhd on test and have Anxiety on it. ""These test are supposed to just hypothesize about patient condition and need to confirm with other clinical information"". This is written under the test results. So I visited my psychiatrist again today, she just asked how was meds, prescribed new meds and refered another psychologist for therapy session and told me that psychologist will talk to you about future progress and done. Thats it. When I questioned her about can you explain the reports she straight up said no,  psychologist will do it.
I mean no explaining about reports or asking about my childhood or anything at all and straight up therapy. And its a hell lot expensive. I don't if this is the procedure or not?

My symptoms
Overthinking everything
Excessive forgetfulness
Lack of motivation

I imagined meeting psychiatrist and having a good conversation about my problems but that was uncomfortable experience. I don't if I should continue visiting her or change psychiatrist?"
770,Anxiety,I have unbearable anxiety right now I'm afraid I'm gonna die of it,Right now I feel so much anxiety and my heartbeat is increasing so fast it's like a panic attack please I think I'm gonna have an heart failure but I would be happy because I can't sustain ot anymore please I need oxygen
771,Anxiety,this sub helped me sm today,"i had to do a presentation today in class in front of maybe 60 students i was TERRIFIED i took propranolol and while waiting for my part i was on here, i searched “presentation” and just read everyones comments helping others and it was so so insightful it calmed me down a lot.

for the presentation i got way too lucky, professor was running out of time and she asked our group to keep it as short as possible 2 sentences max and she’ll give us our grade based on our delivery so my 5 minutes of script i had memorized and practiced everyday was cut to a barely 20 seconds of an abbreviated version of what i prepared, not complaining at all lol.

i was still too nervous to look at anyone in the audience but that’s for another day to tackle..

at the end of the day this just shows how much my anxiety is so set to catastrophize everything, i was stressing about this the moment i heard a presentation was required just imagining the worst possible outcome it ruined a lot of days for me because its all i could think about.

what ended up happening was the total opposite. i enjoyed preparing with my group i was able to stay calm and crack jokes with people i’ve just met and i didn’t shake i didn’t stutter and i did not embarrass my myself i had sm fun today, not at all what my anxiety was telling me for the past three weeks.

as small as this is it seemed impossible for me to do something like this and im really proud of myself."
772,Anxiety,Want to talk about anticipatory anxiety :),"So I recently joined these 9 hour lectured held on tuesday every week.  And it was absolute hell for me because I have anticipatory anxiety and on top of that I was attending alone. It was so severe that I had anxiety on wednesday about the class im about to attend next tuesday. Anxiety 6 days in advance :(

After getring fed up with having these anxietic thoughts I turned to self help books. One that helped me the most was ""power of now"" in which the author said that as long as you ground your thoughts/mind in the presence, you cannot get anxiety. This did work to some extent but the issue is, soon as you let your guard down, intrusive anxiety causing thoughts flood your mind. So it wasn't reliable and i learnt that the hard way when I had a nervous breakdown 2nd week after i came back home because I was trying so hard to block my thoughts that it was stressing me out too much.

So i gave up trying to fix my anxiety issues. gave up reading self help books, reading reddit posts on anxiety fixes and hopelessly attended lectures for 2 more weeks. Wanna hear something funny? the anxiety went from 90% to 5% on these 2 weeks i attended lectures without trying to fight anxeity. bruh. -_-


I've learnt 2 important lessons from this. In dealing with my anxiety, just sucking it up was way more effective than trying to fight or avoid it. 
&gt;""Each of us must confront our own fears, must come face to face with them. How we handle our fears will determine where we go with the rest of our lives. To experience adventure or to be limited by the fear of it.""
--Judy Blume

Eventhough I have heard of this quote before millions of times, I've never had an experience i could associate with it. But now I do

Lesson 2 : anticipatory anxiety is basically our subconcious mind fearing all possible ways an event could go wrong. But in reality almost all situations fall into a template and when you face a certain situation regularly for mutiple times, your subconcious realizes that template and no longer bothers you with reminding you 1000 ways how that event could go wrong."
773,Anxiety,DAE get weird feelings in their head/neck?,"i’ve been experiencing weird feelings, kind of like giddy/fuzzy feelings in my head - particularly at the back and down my neck. I also feel like my head is restless and i have to move it. Is this a common symptom with anxiety and does anyone else experience this?"
774,Anxiety,7.5 milligram of Abilify for anxiety,Any experiences?
775,Anxiety,"Don't want to move forward with my life, I want to remain where I am","Does anybody else feel this way? It's like this weird double layer thing where the obvious thing is the uncertainty of the future is making me anxious, but it's also the *certainty* of some things that make me anxious. Like, just the fact that I will eventually have to work a job, probably 5 days a week for 8 hours a day (or at the very least somewhere in that ballpark.) and I can't even imagine doing that because it feels so not like me, not like a thing I should be doing with my life. I've been successfully avoiding work/a job so far. I'm 23 and now starting my fourth semester at university. But that's stressing me out, too. In the past 3 semesters I have passed exactly one exam. It's all been online because of Covid and the last semester I didn't even bother attending the online classes after like week two. And I am scared about going back to uni next week when classes start again. But I know I have to. I have to catch up 3 semesters, so I have to retake my early courses, I have to do *something* with my life because I am not allowed to just exist. I am not allowed to just find a place in my life where I am comfortable and just stay there. I don't want much out of life, you know, I don't need a big house or apartment, I don't need impressive accomplishments or anything. I'm fine with the apartment I am in now, I'm fine with my low level of luxury I have now. It wasn't always like this. I wasn't fine with where I was two years ago, but I am fine with where I am now, so why can't I just stay here, at this point of my life, for the rest of it. Why do I have to keep moving? Why do I have to keep changing what my life is? It just doesn't feel right. I stay up late because I don't want the days to end and then I stay in bed too long because I don't want a new day to start. Because it's one step closer to change. One day closer to all new anxiety inducing things that for some reason have to happen in life. I just want to stop moving forward."
776,Anxiety,Anxiety from being Trapped,"I usually avoid crowds. So, it's been a long time since I've experienced this. Earlier today, a tall man blocked my ""escape"" from a corner of a room. I'm still feeling wigged about it. Of course, there was no real danger. But, I felt the surge of panic building. I told him he was blocking me, and he didn't move. I gestured for him to move and he finally did. Now that I reflect on it, his position was either blatantly stupid or purposefully anxiety-provoking. Now I just feel a little angry by it. I feel men especially should know not to block women in."

778,Anxiety,pushing myself to go on a date tomorrow (terrified!),"my mental health has been so bad this year that for the past month that ive actually been off sick from work with a doctors note because i began the month in a state of catatonic depression triggered by a sudden breakup this year that sent me spiralling. 

since then ive been pushing myself to go out more as i noticed my anxiety was peaking. at the supermarket i was feeling my heart rate go up, the paranoia of people staring at me, the fiddling of clothes with my hands just it all felt like i was back at square one. ive always had social anxiety but this year it’s returned to its worst. but fighting against it as best i can, ive been travelling to meet friends, going on nights out/activities before my sick note ends to really throw myself back into the life that ive been missing out on this year before heading back to work. 

i’ve been speaking to this guy on tinder for a few weeks now. he lives about half an hour away and he is 100% my type in literally every conceivable way??? it’s as if i had created him myself if that makes sense. when he asked me out i was delighted but then the dread crept in. 

ive never been on a date with somebody ive never met before. i know he is who he says he is that’s not the issue, im just so so terrified ill embarrass myself. that’s where most of my social anxiety comes from, this fear of judgement and people laughing at me that’s invaded my life all these years. im scared ill trip up or say the wrong thing or spill a drink. and at the end of the day i truly don’t expect anything from the date, i know im going because we get on well, he’s funny and kind, i might as well whilst i have the time with my sick note’s final week and he’s so my type that id be a fool not to go meet up with him. i know the likelihood is nothing will come from it and that’s fine because it’s been a great boost getting to know him and he’d be an amazing friend, too! and if it does go further then also great! and if neither happens then my life will go on as usual. my fears for the date aren’t anything to do with that aspect of it, i just don’t want to embarrass myself and it’s holding me back so much

i just wish this fear of making a fool of myself would stop holding me back and i am begging myself not to cancel on this man because of my own insecurities about things i know deep down probably won’t even happen?? so why is this controlling my life so much??"
779,Anxiety,I don't really know how to put this in words,I feel anxious but at the same time I don't. My mind is running a million miles and I feel like my soul is far away and I'm just watching my body as an outsider. But my body looks droopy. I'm slouched and my eyes look dazed. But I don't have that panicky feeling that I usually do when I'm anxious. I recognize that I need a break and I've scheduled ample breaks throughout the day. I've tried calming myself by my usual means but it isn't working because I feel anxious but at the same time I don't. I really don't understand. Help please?
780,Anxiety,Has anyone's anxiety increased even you are on meds for a year?," I've been on anxiety's treatment with meds (and medical follow up, of course) since November, 2020. During this period we had to adjust the medication, I felt that my anxiety was decreasing... Everything seems to be working. 

Last year I spent 4 months in my native county, at my parents house, and I didn't have much trouble with my anxiety there. But, since I went back to where I live, I noticed that my anxiety is increasing and I'm already  feeling the same way that I was without meds/at the treatment beginning. 

I already talked to my doctor about it, but until now he hasn't changed anything... I just wanna know if anyone has had this experience?


Ps: Right now I'm taking Venlafaxina, Bupropiona and Venvanse at morning and Duloxetina at night."

783,Anxiety,Crippling anxiety gang wooo and I’m too young to deal with it on my own and my mom is unsupportive as all fuck,"I’m probably not too young to deal with it on my own, I mean I’m pretty sure I need medication at this point. I’m seeing a therapist and the meditation, positive affirmations shit doesn’t work. Like I know I’ll be fine doing whatever it is that’s making me anxious but I’m still anxious. Like I know school/work will be fine and if I put in the effort I will be okay!! It will be fine!! But the days before it I just can’t relax, I can’t enjoy anything bc I’m constantly worrying… I’m having severe constipation issues due to stress despite eating well, drinking plenty of water, and using laxatives/stool softeners… 

I’m 20, and I work a part time job given I’m in nursing school, so I’m willing to pay for the meds. However I know nothing of how the real world works bc my mom hasn’t taught me anything. She doesn’t want me to take anxiety meds bc she says they’re all benzodiazepines even though that’s not true idk why she’s saying that when she’s forcing me into nursing school so I know that’s not true…. (I don’t really have an interest in anything else other than nursing tho for the money) I just feel like at this rate I need meds and my therapist even suggested it before I started feeling this anxious but I told her I wanted to try more things like meditation/yoga/exercise/positive affirmations but honestly it’s not working it’s not enough. For example I literally KNOW nothing bad will happen at school or work and I KNOW everything gonna be okay and I’ll be fine, but I’m just so anxious for no fucking reason"
784,Anxiety,So I think I may have had a panic attack,"*not asking for medical diagnosis* just feedback. 

I woke up last night while being on the verge of sleep I believe with my heart RACING. It was going so fast and reminded me of when I used to take ecstacy (been a few years ago no correlation). It was very scary and I wavered on whether to call the ambulance for a few minutes. I felt like I was going to throw up

Sn: (even writing this description has me tearing up right now)

So I walk a few feet to my bathroom, turn on the lights and try to orient myself all the while trying not to move too much for fear of accelerating my heart. It wasn't until I laid back down that my heart started to calm down. But then a few minutes later, it came right back. Heart rate shot up. This time I got dressed to go to the ER. After I got dressed, my hr went back down so I decided to lay back down....

THEN I started shivering. Badly. And it increased in waves. I started getting super clammy hands and it was very hard to regulate my temperature. I was in a t shirt and underwear but felt sweaty. I get up to get dressed and my legs are TREMORING really badly. Like debilitatingly so. It was harder to get dressed this time. Idk why but I laid back down and tried to calm down again. After a few minutes, I felt like maybe a change of environment would help so I went to my guest bedroom and fell asleep within 10 minutes.

This was one of the scariest things I've experienced ( at leastsince I took too much ecstacy in 2014).

Background: I did smoke before bed but have absolutely never had an adverse reaction to weed. I've been really pushing myself the last few weeks driving for Uber to pay off credit cards so I definitely have not been taking care of myself. Work the last couple weeks and the next few weeks has been and will be very stressful so I'm sure that contributed to it. But I've never had my body react like this before and felt specifically like a panic attack but Idk. I read a few posts on this sub describing panic attacks and started crying cause it matched up so closely."
785,Anxiety,Catastrophizing,"My anxiety is part of my PMDD, and manageable with hydroxyzine most of the time.

Usually, I have general anxiety for 24-48 hours, and then I'm fine until the next monthly cycle.

The past few days, I've been having extreme swings from feeling fine to catastrophizing, and I wish I was dead. (Not going to self-harm or anything, just wish I didn't have to live like this.)

My condition didn't even begin until August 2021...how in the hell do people live like this for years?"
786,Anxiety,Any tips for managing email-related anxiety?,"So, I just had to send an email to one of my lecturers asking a question about something, and it's made me really anxious. Every time I send an email, I start worrying about how it comes across, if I'm saying the right thing, if I sound unprofessional. I reread it like ten times before I send it, and I put off pressing send for as long as possible. Honestly, I'd rather never ask anything than have to ask in an email, but that's not really an option. 

So does anyone have any tips for managing anxiety about sending emails?"
787,Anxiety,How long do effects linger after a major attack?,"I had my first real genuine full blown anxiety/panic attack 2 days ago while 3 hours from home, and after calming down enough to have a friend drive me back I haven't been the same? I've always suffered from overthinkong and slight/mild panic attacks that usually start and end within 5 minutes. However I just can't fully shake this one, it's gotten better but as things stand I can't muster the courage to leave my house for more than a few hours and the thought of going back to work or doing anything scares me because of the possibility of another attack. 

My real question here is, how long does the lingering effects last for anyone that has gone through anything similar? The rest of the day after the attack i couldn't fully relax/calm down until I was staying still/laying down. Yesterday I woke up fine but as soon as I got about my day to go to the doctor the slight shaky feeling and constant panic was there but not major. While sitting in the doctor's office I felt fine, and after eating and moving there was slight scared moments but overall no attacks but again once I was in my room and laying down I felt calm and could sleep or watch my show. 

Right now I'm sitting at a park overall relaxed but my head still feels off? I'm tired often and Not so much overthinking but I can't focus nor concentrate, it feels like my head has this pressure in it. The doctors did an EKG to check my heart and there was nothing wrong there, he just recommended an MRI and diet/exercise change. I'm still waiting on the MRI results though. I've had these tension headaches prior so I feel like the anxiety attack I had is just trying to convince me that this is related, but I figured I'd ask here to see if anyone else has felt the same. I just feel like there's no going back, and I will always feel a slight panic :(

The doctor prescribed me .5 of Xanax to take daily as needed but I haven't taken any, I have them there if I have a bad attack similar to what caused this"
788,Anxiety,Buspirone,I’m currently taking Buspirone 10mg 2x daily. It seem to work at first but not so much now. Plus it was my first time on it so my question is does it mean I need a higher dose now. Because it was working well at first but now not so much. I know it’s trial period to see what’s good for me. Just asking my Anxiety Family 🙏🏾🙏🏾🥹
789,Anxiety,Car anxiety and worrying about losing my job,"I have a service appointment scheduled in a few days for my car (which has 122k miles so far) which I depend upon to get to/from work. I have constant anxiety now that the dealership will call me and tell me that there's a major issue with the car that'll cost thousands to fix (which I don't have). If that's the case, then I'll lose my job and have bill collectors harassing me since it's very difficult for me to find work being neurodivergent and all.

I wish there was something that could ease my mind about this, as I feel miserable now and am starting to have trouble staying asleep."
790,Anxiety,Why is finding a therapist so difficult,"Honestly I want to give up on finding one even though I KNOW deep down how badly I need to find a professional I can trust to talk to. My first experience with trying to look for help was in high school for body image issues/EDs. The counselor I met with just looked at me and said it was “a load of horseshit” that I see myself that way lol. And that’s basically it. “Wow thanks sir, my ED is cured now” 🙄

Anyways that turned me off from seeking therapy for about a decade and in the meantime, my anxiety has just been festering and growing to the point it’s affecting my physical health. I had a recent health scare where I felt/had all the symptoms of a heart attack and went to the ER just to be told there’s nothing wrong with me. Besides just general existential anxiety, life has recently thrown me a huge financial stressor that’s ever-present in the back of my head, and my physical symptoms, like difficulty breathing, have just gotten worse and more frequent. 

I tried Cerebral for a couple weeks (the online therapy app) thinking that would be a “gentle” way to get into therapy, but they just wanted to prescribe me meds right off the bat and the talking session felt very generic/textbook. I didn’t really feel like I was heard as an individual at all, more like treated as “just another anxiety patient”. I personally don’t want to go on meds because I already have anxiety over health issues and I don’t want to deal with any possible side effects. 

Anyways now I’m doing what my friend suggested by looking for therapists on PsychologyToday but most either don’t seem to be accepting new clients, and the ones that do that I emailed just straight up ghosted me lol. Idk just give me a reason to push through with finding a therapist/I’m open to any other suggestions. I just feel like giving up"
791,Anxiety,Anyone struggling with head spasms(involuntary head twitching) ?,It's really so much. I can bear with it when I'm alone but in public I keep on trying to controle it although it's so hard cause I can't let people see that. It's so tiring.
792,Anxiety,"Starting a new job soon, need to reverse my sleeping pattern. Advice?","I don’t want to post this on insomnia, because I actually sleep consistently at the same time, issue is that time is 6am. I’m just nervous about how I’ll manage to do this.

I’ve been jobless for a couple months and I’ve fallen into sleeping around 6 and waking up around 2. The clocks went forward the other day and this has made it worse. Today I woke up at gone 3pm. 

I start a new job for the summer soon where I should be out of the house by 9. I don’t think I’m gonna be able to adjust my sleeping pattern gradually, because every time I try to set an alarm even for 12, when I don’t have anywhere to be that day, I don’t even remember turning off the alarm and just wake up later.

Any advice for how I can adjust myself to waking up early in a short amount of time? I figured worst case it’s just a rough first week, but I’m honestly worried having no sleep will make me feel anxious or cause my to panic while learning a new job."
793,Anxiety,Creating a resume/cv is hard if you have extremely low self-esteem. Any thoughts or recommendations?,"I'm advised to take internships to boost my chances for grad school. The thing is, I can't write a decent resume without thinking that that's not me, I can't do any job well. I kind of don't even want to say that I have imposter syndrome because that implies that I have a highly adept intellectual ability to doubt upon. 

Honestly, I focus on team-based project experiences just so I can't deny the accomplishments made. I've written numerous research papers with my groupmates and, for most of them, acted as project manager tasked with allocating time, delegating tasks and writing progress reports. 

I can somewhat acknowledge my importance and relevance to a team but I can't find my individual skills valuable, if that makes sense. 

It's when I am confident that I can contribute to a research paper but it'll surely be abysmal if I write by myself. What does that mean about me and how can I improve my outlook on myself?"
794,Anxiety,I made it through a job interview!!,"I’m visibly shaking right now, but I did it. I made it through the anticipatory anxiety, the panic of “oh my god. Ok. I’m in the interview room” and the after-anxiety of What Ifs and What I Should Have Dones.

I’m proud of myself for getting this far and working through my panic and fear. I stumbled through my words sometimes and forgot a lot of the things I wanted to say, but I feel like I made a good impression.

Even if I don’t get the job, I know I can be proud of myself for getting this far. It took a lot of steps to get here and I did it!!"
795,Anxiety,"First time, need guidance","Hi all!

Not sure where to start. Normally im a young energetic guy that doesnt worry. 1 week ago I tried ritalin as a ""fun"" thing. My friend said 5 minutes after taking the tablet that as long as I dont have any problems with psychosis or the like im ok...thats where I think I got a panic attack. I personally dont have any history of psychosis. Not at all. But my brother has some form of schizophrenia. So I think I literally panicked and thought id ruined my life. I got dizzy and had to lie down.

Next day was ok didnt sleep much. The following days I had a big test for university and then work...slept bad, ate bad...etc

Started reading about schizophrenia and thought I was developing it. Which im clearly not lol. I remember how my brother was when he got sick. Im not like that. Anyway I got a panic attack I think at work and had to go home.

My big issue the past week is the insane dizzyness/vertigo. I think its from anxiety. Does anyone here recognize this? Will it go over? Ive never had this dizzyness feeling before...ive never had an issue with anxiety before. But I definitely feel like the past week ive worried a LOT."
796,Anxiety,Psych recommended Prozac…,"Hi! As the total states my psychiatrist suggested Prozac for my anxiety, as I already do all of the good things like exercise, meditate, journal etc. I have unspecified anxiety.

I’m a little stressed about this tbh because as a teen I was put on Zoloft and was very numbed and emotionless and I’m worried that Prozac would do this. I used to take Zoloft for depression but depression is not an issue for me anymore. It was likely situation based when I was a teen.

Does anyone have experience with this med?"
797,Anxiety,Physical symptoms,"Why does this have to happen I have health anxiety and it's killing me. Headaches for weeks dizziness for ages, never blackout or fainted btw I'm 15 I can barely enjoy my life. All i think about is if I got a brain tumor or if I'm gonna be alive tomorrow it's killing me. Everyone is so happy I just can't I have to put a fake face on and get on with it ."
798,Anxiety,I am so unbelievably humiliated,"A bit of context for the full story:

Since i’m currently deciding what i want to do career wise, i still live with my parents, so i try my best to keep things clean and help out around the house. But sometimes i get into really bad depression episodes, and i let trash and dirty laundry pile up for weeks until i get the motivation to clean. 

That being said, today is my day off of work where i planned to clean my entire room. My parents forgot to mention a woman they hired to help clean came today. I had to awkwardly greet her unshowered with no bra, then take my phone and rush downstairs where i’m currently hiding in a pile of blankets. This poor woman has to somehow vacuum a carpet covered in clothes and pet hair, dust around empty cups and packages, and worst of all, clean my stained toilet that i got glitter stuck on the inside to due to an art project gone wrong. I’m so afraid she thinks im some weird lazy kid who never cleans and just leaves my shit everywhere and lives like a gross slob. I know this probably isn’t the worst she’s seen, but my messy rooms are one of my major insecurities. I don’t know if i want advice or am just venting, i just hate how i’m an adult and still have trouble taking care of myself.

TLDR: my room is a disaster and unbelievably messy, and i didn’t know someone hired to clean was coming until they were already in my room."
799,Anxiety,jeeesussssssssssss stop the fucking time it's running from under my feet,[deleted]
800,Anxiety,First bad panic attack in a while,"I woke up to the feeling of an extremely faint heartbeat, I couldn't really find a pulse and then I begin to get an uncomfortable ache in the middle of my chest, my hands begin to tingle. At this point I'm panicking thinking my life is in danger, as it is hard not to think I'm having a heart attack. I get up, pacing around, I go downstairs and drink water, I calm down then it happens again. The aches in the middle of my chest come back and I think that I'm going to die.

I'm still going through it as I type this, I don't know what to do.

To add, I'm also trembling badly."
801,Anxiety,Third breakdown this week,"I don't have many, if any, friends I would consider close, let alone friends which I feel like I can share deeper feelings with. I would say 1 - 2 semi-close friends. Which again I have trouble opening up to.

For starters, I have an issue speaking up at all, due to constant overthinking. Overthinking which again leads to most of my breakdowns lately it seems.

In the latest, I unintentionally hurt one of said friends by bringing up a bad topic. I'm beating myself up for not taking the hints earlier. This person means the world to me, and of course I would never intentionally go in to harm them, but things happened. 

I feel so stupid for not being able to express myself properly. I want to let them know how much it hurts me that I made them feel this way. But I feel like I'm invalidating their feelings by doing so. So it ends up in me choking, and not being able to say anything. 

They're pretty much what keeps me going in life, and I feel so guilty and selfish by thinking about my fear of losing them over this.

So, now I'm crawled up, hiding under a blanket, crying. When I really should be there for my friend."
802,Anxiety,called someone a droogie and they got upset with me,"a fellow redditor was in need of help so in my comment i called them droogie which is nasdat for ""friend"" (from A Clockeork Orange .) well , theyre sober , and thought i called them a drug addict . 

for some reason i feel horrible , and that i further jeopardized their health ? did i do anything wrong ?"
803,Anxiety,"Weird feelings, wondering if these were related to anxiety or something? I can’t find answers","So I’m (F18) in the process to get help but I might have to wait up to a month to get to see a psy. There is something that is happening more and more and is very distressing. I remember it happening even before my 11th birthday. It seems like not everyone experience this(I used to think it was as common as a simple headache). In fact, almost everyone gives me concerned looks when I talk about it. I can’t even find informations online. 
If anyone ever lived this i would love to know

So

It happens most of the time Around people I am attached to, or comfortable around, or in a safe situation

Suddenly I feel really uneasy around them or within myself. On some occasions, its as if my body needs to hide. 

The feeling last from 1 to 10~ seconds. Like a big peak in the beginning

Then it make me really scared because i don’t understand whats happening and i feel incredibly disconnected from everyone

I feel the urge to be alone in my safe place (my bed)

The fear doesnt leave, it only brings more 
Such as ""what is wrong with me, who are they really""

The fear slowly calms down, lasting for max 1h and everything slowly goes back to normal. 

I remember rare times it was so huge. Those moments are very short lasting, but make me feel so terrible it’s almost panic-like. I feel incredibly wrong deep in my chest. It is so intense i can only pay attention to that. It is so disturbing.

Thanks"
804,Anxiety,Cluttered environments.,"Realizing now how much of a negative effect this has on my mind. I cannot work efficiently with clutter.

Makes my head spin and amps up my stress. Maybe there is something to minimalism."
805,Anxiety,I'm just so tired.,"Might as well post this here as well, but this is just a vent. TW: This will go into topics of anxiety, depression, and if there is anything else I should add as a trigger warning please let me know. And I guess verbal abuse is another thing mentioned in here? Not sure if it would be considered that? And I guess the gagging and vomiting portion as well is another thing. 

This might be a long post, but I'm just so tired and I just don't know what to do or how to understand what any of this I feel is. 

This is a throwaway account, but I might end up deleting this just in case later. 


Anytime I've tried to talk to a therapist about what's going on with me and my anxiety, all I'd get told is to do breathing exercises and write things down in a journal. Both of which never helped in the slightest, the first therapist just stopped doing appointments altogether and I never had a chance to get another appointment with my second attempt with a therapist.

I've tried to talk to my doctor about it, but my mom being in the room made it hard to explain it fully but she did give me therapist recommendations at that time. That was a few years ago however and I don't think I've seen her since, I don't know the pandemic and covid has just made my sense of time all fucked. 

I have experienced panic attacks before, I'm constantly overthinking and I would get intrusive thoughts that made me fucking hate what I was thinking. Being in a crowd makes me anxious, people touching me makes me anxious, talking to people even if I know them makes me anxious. Because I'm constantly overthinking, it's hard to concentrate on things that I'm not thinking about. I have trouble sleeping as well, sometimes I don't sleep at all that night because I can't stop thinking. I'm always told that my hands are always sweaty even if I try to wipe them off on my pants.

I'm also constantly thinking about situations in which I die or get hurt even if I know that will not happen. I have thought of how anything I'm doing or what I'm about to do could end horribly even if it won't. I always take a while when it comes to responding because I have trouble with tone and I'm worried about how this person will react if I say this or that. I've been told I apologize too much. I don't think the anxiety I experience is regular anxiety that occurs every once in awhile, especially since I'm constantly like this often for a majority of the days and months.

I have been like this for as long as I could remember, especially with the environment I grew up in and am still in (parents, yelling, often drunk or passed out, smoking, etc in front of me throughout my childhood. They would also often leave me as a child to my older sisters to take care of when they were only teenagers and still in school and be out all night- only to come home drunk). My mother and my older sister would constantly yell, sometimes at me or at something else and would bang on the walls or throw things which as a result, I constantly flinch when I think I will be hit or someone touches me. My friends and classmates have asked me before why I flinch so hard or why do I act like they hurt me when they touch me. I still do this, and it still happens. I have told a friend about this before and he has remarked that my mother is a narcissist. She would twist her words and tell stories about events that went much, much, differently than they actually did or what she thought of someone compared to how she interacted with them in person. I have also been told that she is a racist so I guess there's that.

I was also severely depressed for several years since childhood and throughout middle school, I've now been getting slowly better in highschool but I still get those thoughts occasionally. I won't go into it but it was pretty bad especially the thoughts and impulses I would get, although I never acted on any of them even if I was seriously considering it. I also never practiced personal hygiene often, where I would just stop taking showers for long periods of times and wouldn't take one unless someone told me to. However, my parents chalked it up to me being lazy and I just didn't care and didn't want to do anything even though it was apparently extremely obvious that other people could tell I was depressed and needed help. I didn't go into therapy until a few years ago and am not currently in therapy anymore as it never worked out.

I have been told that I was being rude or mean when I didn't mean to or I didn't think I was being either of those in the slightest. I have trouble conveying what I actually mean and how to express emotion. I would actually observe my classmates to figure out what I was feeling because I didn't understand social interaction or emotions. I'm still not good with social cues, but I do have a better understanding of what I'm feeling. Making eye contact is hard however unless I know the person. Being touched makes me insanely uncomfortable unless I know the person. Even if it's just a brush against my arm or my back, it makes me feel uncomfortable and I need to get away. Sometimes I get the urge to pull away and make myself as small as possible to avoid being touched. I have also been told by a friend that a physical motion I do looks like a tic because sometimes I will violently shiver even if I am not cold in the slightest and it'll sometimes happen repeatedly. Certain textures also make me have the same feeling, I don't know why. 

Trying to talk to people is hard, I never know how to add into a conversation without being ignored. Anytime I've tried to talk to someone one-on-one, I've been ignored or they just simply didn't hear me and I feel too awkward to try again so I stay silent. There's been times where I've wanted to say something, but I can't get anything out. It feels as if I have gone mute, and no sound can be produced no matter how hard I try or it's like a barrier I can't get past. It's why I stay silent so often because I can't get out what I want to say or I just feel too awkward about trying to interact with people sometimes because of anxiety related thoughts. 

I was considered a picky eater growing up, and certain foods were my ""safe"" foods according to my dad. I would only eat certain things, sometimes for a long period of time. I can't eat vegetables and some fruits at all even if I try to because they make me gag. I can eat raw carrots but never cooked because the mushy texture makes me want to vomit. Eating broccoli, cauliflower, blueberries, peas, tomatoes (like slices or whole ones), and etc without feeling like gagging and throwing up either because of the texture, the taste or the smell of it. I have tried to force myself to eat broccoli before but trying even the smallest piece made me instantly want to throw up. I remember my sister being pissed at me for taking an hour to eat six pieces of broccoli when I was a child, I remember that I was on the verge of tears and gagging with every bite that I forced myself to swallow but I didn't want to be yelled at so I ate them anyway and spat out the last one when I went to the bathroom. Sometimes even with food I like, the texture suddenly fucks with me and I have the urge to throw up. 

I don't know why that happens, but I hate feeling like I'm being judged or being rude for not eating what I'm given and picking off what I don't want to eat because I know I will not be able to eat it even if I try to. 

I just hate experiencing these things, and I don't understand why I feel these things or what it is. I'm just tired and nothing has helped. I've tried therapy, I've tried the advice my therapist has given me, I've tried talking to my doctor, but none of it has helped. Although I do know that with therapy it can take time especially to find the right therapist and all.

If anyone has any idea or at least some advice then thank you. I'm sorry if none of this makes much sense or if it's a bit all over the place, I tried to explain as well as I could and I'm hoping I explained it the way I wanted to but yea, thanks if anyone does end up reading this."
806,Anxiety,Anxiety or Losing My Mind,"Hello people of Reddit.

I have never really took part in Reddit other than just viewing other peoples post and such. And I’m not sure if anyone will see this or responded but I need to put it out there.

I am a 24M with healthy anxiety and probably regular anxiety. I am always worry about my health like for example I am going through a time where I am worried I have MS. And when I was younger and I convinced myself I had a brain tumor. Freaked out so bad I went and got a CAT scan and everything came back normal. 

Now that you know that. I can’t tell if it’s just my anxiety messing with my mind or if im losing my mind. I get paranoid when something weird happens to me. Like today for example I found a new song in my playlist on Spotify that I don’t remember added. At first I was freaking out that someone hacked my account but then I started thinking that maybe I did it and don’t remember. 

This led to me having anxiety that I’m losing my mind and can’t remember stuff I’m doing. 

Thanks for coming to my tedtalk, I would love if someone comments some tips to deal with anxiety.

Much love"
807,Anxiety,People who downvote on this sub should be banned,People are being vulnerable opening up. Downvoting people and making them feel bad is not cool. Stop being cowards.
808,Anxiety,Lost appetite,"2 days ago a family thing happened and it triggered a major break down. I say major because it was the first time I broke down in front of my parents, but since then   I haven't really eaten anything. I haven't even felt hungry the entire time. I'm trying to force myself to eat a potato and egg taco but starting feel nauseous. I don't know what to do."
809,Anxiety,How did you overcome anxiety,"Everyone says meditate and eat better and all these things, like just think about it rationally. My anxiety overtakes me there's no way I'm going to just think I'm fine and I'll be fine. 

Now I actually had a stint of anxiety years ago for about 7 years. I never had a panic attack or any anxiety before that. I swear I cute my anxiety almost instantaneously I had this thought about compassion and even though I felt like everyone had done me wrong I have to go beyond what I thought was appropriate and have compassion for people and I felt this weight lift off my chest. I mean does anyone have any stories about how they overcame anxiety?"
810,Anxiety,Why is anxiety making me push away people I love?,"So I’ve been in this really bad loop lately stressing about collage/ the new change in my life, but my friends don’t understand and they’re making it really hard. They’ve even said rude things about me and how I’m inconsiderate. Am I? I’m just trying to prepare for college but I feel like I can’t move forward if I don’t have anything/ anyone behind me….."
811,Anxiety,Am I going crazy ?,"It's been a stressful year to say the least for me and my husband. We love each other but have gotten into some nasty fights and it's been 5 years of our marraige.
 
We were in the car when this altercation started and he left leaving Me and toddler in the car. 

We continued fighting on the phone which resulted in me throwing my phone on the street amd screaming at the top of my lungs in BROAD DAYLIGHT.  I was outside the car and toddler inside. 

People were watching and the cops pulled up soon after. Husband returned to car and everything was alright but I'm SHOOK. 

I'm generally a very shy person and would avoid attention at any cost."
812,Anxiety,Anxiety sucks,"(Tw: mention of suicide) I've only been clinically diagnosed with anxiety since I was 13 but I feel like my symptoms only continue to worsen. I can't even have a conversation with a kid my age without shaking or bursting into tears. I went on medication last year for my anxiety and it worsened my depression but when i switched over to a different medication it did the opposite, affecting my depression but worsening my anxiety. My mom went to get me tested for ADHD a couple months back and the people at the doctors office denied her request to get me tested since i'm too old to be diagnosed. Personally though I don't care about that because I live with myself and know I don't have ADHD. I just don't know how much longer I can go on. I'm so alone and have barely any friends and i don't want to scare off my new ones with the problem i have. Anxiety has affected my grades, relationships and any opportunity given to me. I even tried to end my life a week ago by taking an entire bottle of ibuprofin and downing it with vodka. It clearly didn't work and i spent my entire Wednesday morning puking on myself. And it's been almost a year since my mom called the suicide hotline on me. I rembere exactly what my lowest felt like, and that was it. I was all alone since school had just gotten out and I didn't have a phone so I was cut off from my friends. And before you make assumptions, covid was big at this time and I'm not lucky enough to have friends who live close to me. Anyways i'll tell you the story,  my mom had walked into my room to wake me up. She came in to make sure I didn't sleep the whole day and she found and empty beer can in my room. She yelled at me as any parent would and we got into an argument when she started going on a tangent about how my depression affected her and how much of a bad and selfish person I was. Anyways she stomps off to her room and I go into her room to look for a bandaid because the previous night, when I was under the influence, I made a pretty deep cut on my left arm. It was deep enough it was still bleeding the next morning even after i had put a towel over it all night. Anyways my mom calls up the suicide hotline and a man comes to do an evaluation. Anywasy when it's all said and done he goes ""all right so were gonna meet up at the hospital"". And yada yada ya yk the rest. I have so many stories I could tell about things that have happened to me I think are interesting or make me, me but not many people are okay with hearing this. I mean this story alone would get me shunned. In my school it's not okay to be depressed or anxious. My government teacher even said and I quote ""the world does not care if you have anxiety and neither do I"". Now don't get me wrong, he's right but when you've spent the last three years wanting to k1ll yourself, you might see things a little differntly. Or the time when a girl jumped off the breezeway of our school headfirst trying to kill herself. The school kept it so quiet you'd think it was a rumor until you saw the blood splatter. I'm sure we all ask ourselves why we have this disorder but I truly want to know why me? I want to know why certain people in my life were put there when they ultimately ruined it. I don't think I've had a single friend in my enitre life truly help me. it's always been me and I'm so sick and tired. Maybe i'm a brat or selfish but that's an outsiders point of view. If you truly knew what went on in our heads, you'd think twice before you decided to speak what's in yours. That's all I have to say and remember don't get mad over what a stranger has to say."

816,Anxiety,I semi-conquered my fear!,"So I (21f) have a pretty big fear of doctors and hospitals because of some past experiences. Even just the thought of making an appointment with a doctor gives me so much stress and anxiety I always end up putting it off. This time though I know I needed to go as there was something wrong with my heart (not just anxiety tricking me this time LOL). It took a while but I finally worked up the courage to go into the walk-in at my doctors office. Unfortunately, they weren't able to do anything for me there as they didn't have the right equipment for the tests so I had to go to the hospital. I had to go by myself because due to COVID I couldn't bring my friend or a parent with me cause I'm not a minor. The whole drive there I was in tears, shaking, extremely on edge which I think was making my heart worse. I was terrified I was going to have a panic attack and considered driving back home at one point. 

But I pushed through and got to the hospital. At one point I had to get blood work done and because I passed out last time I had it done I was kinda freaking out. I have really deep veins so it took the nurse 2 tries to get the needle in. I was shaking, couldn't breathe, tears in my eyes, could barely speak and I accidentally looked at the needle as it was in my arm and immediately got really woozy and sick. The nurse was very kind and always asking me if I was okay or if I needed her to stop which was really nice. 

I was extremely anxious and uncomfortable the whole time. I brought a book with me to read while I waited but couldn't even focus enough to read it. While I was waiting for my test results, my mind of course ran through every worst case scenario. My stomach was doing that ""dropping"" thing every few minutes the whole 4 hours I was there.

In the end, everything is okay! I had this heart thing before a few years ago. It's called pericarditis and it's the swelling and irritation of the thin, saclike tissue surrounding the heart. Which causes some pretty painful symptoms. It basically feels like walking around with heart attack all day. Luckily this time it wasn't as bad as the first time, so I can just take some Advil and it should go away on it's own within the next few days. 

Overall, I can't say I've conquered my fear as I'm still terrified about the next time I may have to go, but I did it this time! I know it's kinda silly considering I'm a full grown adult, but I honestly didn't think I was going to be able to go to the doctor/hospital by myself again. But I did it! Thank you for reading and remember that you are stronger than your anxiety makes you think!"
817,Anxiety,When I was quarantined becouse of covid I had daily anxiety attacks (I'm not afraid of covid). When It ended and I started working again the attacks stoped completely. What gives? It seems like it's not a chemical imbalance in all fairness.,I hardly even want days off from work becouse my anxiety increases. I don't have the money for therapy to know the reason behind this strange anxiety of mine. I feel normal in my work days but I feel like absolute shit in the off days. I stay at home on my off days and I think that this is the reason behind my overall anxiety. I spend over 5 years without going out once with friends somewhere. I stayed at home and played games all day long thinking that I like it. The most strange part is that my anxiety attacks happends in a very specific hour of the day. I'm still trying to find the reason behind it.

819,Anxiety,"Does anyone else use tv, music, podcasts to zone out 100% of the time?","It’s becoming a problem for me lately. I work from home and from the moment I wake up I put something on in the background and just disappear. If I turn it off for a few minutes I just overthink and cry. I always fall asleep to something, Which isn’t helping my insomnia. I just wish I could be a person and exist but it’s so exhausting to hear my thoughts. I’ve been trying to wait until I finish breakfast this week before I put on a podcast and numb out for 8 hours while I work. I honestly have no idea how people just exist. My attention needs to be occupied or I spiral immediately.  Has anyone dealt with something similar or have ideas on how to get out of this bad habit?"
820,Anxiety,Anxiety and asthma/constant shortness of breath,"So quick back story, I'm 26 and have had severe anxiety since I was in my teens. However, for the past year or so I have noticed issues with my breathing. I believe I had asthma as a child but this feels different as it's a near-constant feeling of not being able to catch a full breath, like I get 90% of it and feel like I hit a wall. I had covid in early Jan and between the infection and the anxiety about it I almost went to the ER as my breathing was so bad it kept me up 2 days straight. The weird part is that any time that I am extremely focused on something (video games, work, etc.) It goes away. For example while I'm typing this it's there, but it's not as bad. The other day I had an important work meeting and didn't think about my breathing once or had any noticeable issues the whole time. It's like my brain was too busy worrying about doing the meeting properly and forgot about my breathing issues. I also never wake up in the middle of the night struggling to breathe; once I fall asleep I sleep through the night. 

Does anyone struggle with something similar to this? Could it be anxiety or something else? I went to the Dr for this a while back and I didn't really feel as though the provided inhaler really worked so I just have no clue."

What if I’m late and they leave? What if they don’t actually want to be there? What if I get shot or something like that? All these “What if’s” and also just social anxiety. Also to add to it my grandmother is dying and is likely to happen in the next few days so I’m already feeling down which makes it worse.

Does anyone here have any ideas to help me out?

Thanks a ton guys

826,Anxiety,Existential anxiety and feeling depressed,"Where do I start?
 
Well, first of all, somehow this period happened again after almost 4 years, and, if I remember correctly, it happened at the same time of the year. 

I should maybe mention my habits, my sleep is ruined, I sleep during the day and ruminating and watching tv during the night, no exercise whatsoever, my diet was pure crap before this, and now its even worse because I eat almost nothing, I used to eat only junk stuff and play GTA online most of the time, I quit my job before all of this because I was anxious at work, I've been through a very traumatic breakup with my gf couple of months ago, I really don't know what triggered all this AGAIN. 

Should I change habits? Start exercising? Start spending more time outside? Cause I don't go outside at all almost, just for bare necessities like cigarettes and water etc. 

I also should mention that I'm moving in back with my mom and stepfather, they are great and positive people, hard workers and I envy their views on things, I live alone and my two friends come over very often, that are my best friends btw, but I must admit that they are really negative and have morbid jokes and stuff like that that didn't suit me at all in the past two months, it did all the opposite for me than making me laugh and relax, I'm moving to another country and maybe I should stay away from them for a while, and also from my environment, I live in Serbia and people are weird and mean, everything looks like a ruin, like it's stuck in some post soviet era, all in all depressing place and depressing people. I'm going to Slovenia tomorrow and I wonder will environment play any kind of role in this. I hope it will."
827,Anxiety,Coping mechanisms,"I need to get a handle on my anxiety. It’s been getting really out of hand. And I want to tackle it head on because it’s been taking over my life lately. I intend to start therapy soon and hopefully get on some medication. But I know that there will be more work that is required. 

I need to develop good coping mechanisms to help calm me down when I’m getting anxious. Thinking about getting into meditation and such for now. Breathing exercises.

I hate that I have to work five times harder to be on-par with other students. I hate that if I take a break for one day I can't ever seem to catch up.

831,Anxiety,anxiety &amp; the sudden urge to excessively clean/be flawless? how does one manage this?,"about a year ago, i believe i was in a pretty bad cycle of depression &amp; anxiety due to quarantine and the stress of an underlying health condition i had. it was hard for me to get up in the morning as i often wishes i hadn’t. my room was pretty messy most of the time ( clothes everywhere, organized drawers, hadn’t been cleaned thoroughly, etc ). i’ve gotten better but lately i’ve noticed ill be doing absolutely nothing and get the urge to get up and clean. and it doesn’t even matter if i had just cleaned a few days ago i manage to find something new to clean (drawers, rearrange my closet, rearrange my room layout). and it can never be a quick clean it’ll always end up taking me 5 hours or so. i find it most troubling when i do it in order to avoid doing homework that i really have to get done. the older i get the more minimalist &amp; precise i’ve gotten. i have barely anything on my walls in my room and always have nothing on my desks/drawer set. when i get ready to go out, i find that i’ll be running late bc i feel the need to put everything back in exactly the right place. thoughts?"
832,Anxiety,I think I'm having panic attacks. Doctors aren't open until Monday.,"I'm based in the UK, the doctor surgeries aren't open until Monday but I feel like this is getting worse and could use some advice and maybe reassurance? There's not much I can do until Monday morning. 

I never thought I'd suffer with anxiety and/or panic attacks but it truly feels like I'm having them. Randomly, I just feel weird. My chest tightens and feels heavy, sometimes my arms starts feeling strange and I feel like I'm really hot. 

Around two weeks ago I went to the hospital with these ""symptoms"" as I was worried it might of been something heart related and after being in there for a full day, everything was fine and they didn't diagnose anything. I'm not sure what triggered that but since then a similar feeling is happening regularly and I've noticed that when I think about certain things or people I care about, it starts. 

I feel like I'm pretty self aware about it and can calm my mind down but my body still feels like that. My partner is currently on holiday but has contracted COVID and her condition is pretty bad and worsening too and this isn't helping - I haven't slept this night AT ALL. 

Does this sound like anxiety or a recurring issue? Is there anything I can do before I can speak to my doctor?

Now, something a little controversial but I want to be as open and honest as possible. I never understood anxiety and when it effects other people and always use to think to myself.. ""why is it such a big deal?"", ""just breathe"", ""stop worrying or thinking about it"" but these events have really opened my eyes to the problems that people face everyday and how little control I have."

836,Anxiety,Currently freaking out over a potential modeling job.,"I’m winding down from a panic attack rn and sometimes it helps me feel better when I make a post about it. People have told me I should model and I always thought about modeling but have never really viewed myself as attractive I’m more or less just tall and that’s it. I’ve been trying to challenge my anxiety and do things that are out of my comforts zone so one day I decided to send in some images to a local agency and they wanted to see me and do an interview. I was really happy at first but the agency wanted to see a portfolio when I went on the interview. Which as someone with no experience, I didn’t have. So I found a local photographer and scheduled a photo shoot. I payed a down payment of 100 and I am expected to bring in 260 more during the shoot. That is a lot for a 17 year old who works part time. So at first I was excited but the more I’ve been thinking about this the less I want to do it. I keep telling myself that it’s just my nerves and I need to suck it up and just go to the shoot but I don’t want to model. I have had problems with my body for a while and was doing pretty good at recovery but I’m starting to get into a dark mindset because of this. I want to but I don’t want to at the same time. I know I can’t get the 100 back cuz it was a deposit but I can still cancel. I’m worried about what my mom will think, she tells me all I do is quit everything and she’s right. I can’t tell if it’s just my anxiety not wanting to do with it if I genuinely don’t want to do with. I’m so panicked. It’s kind of stupid. I wish I thought this through."

I then told my customers I'd be right back since ""I had to fix something in the back really quick"".

842,Anxiety,WTF is wrong with me,"At the beginning of January I had a dental procedure done to close a gap in my front teeth.  After a few days I started to hate it and became obsessed with how it felt and the fact that there was something “fake” on my teeth.  So I had it removed, but it doesn’t feel the same.  The pictures show that they are as close as possible and 99 percent the same, but it doesn’t matter.  I’m a second opinion on it by a different dentist because for some reason I think that will put my mind at ease, but  in reality I know it won’t.  

I know it’s irrational but I literally feel like I’ll never be the same person again.  I think it feels weird when I talk but everyone says I sound fine.  I’ve had ridiculous anxiety and some OCD all my life but for some reason this small incident has sent me into a tailspin of anxiety attacks almost daily.  I can still function but everyday I wake up sick to my stomach and with a lump in my throat.  This is embarrassing because I know im overreacting but I cannot help it."

It was alright from the start but after my boss gave me a hectic job for 1 week, it started to stress me out. Now one of the client was very frustrated and disappointed because I did mistake on backing her files up. One mistake and it shattered me. Maybe the stress was filing up. I can still back it up again. But it really shattered me. I literally cried because of the stress was too much. I don't have anyone to lean on. I mean I have friends and family but I can't let them feel down just I because I shared my depress feelings and thoughts. One night, I was sitting at the chair of my desk in office, it was already 7pm. My usual out is 5pm. I was sitting and staring into emptiness for 2 hours... 'I want to end this but how'. I found a scissor on top of the other desk. I grabbed it slowly and point it at my wrist... I didn't have the courage to do it. I still want to live my life... But my mind was telling me that 'it is the only way out'. I know I won't do that suicide thought, I know it. But my mind's telling me that is the only option. I hope I bounce back from this storm of my life. Thanks for my friends and family."

I was literally shaking during the first episode. im not sure if it’s because of me just thinking it’s the awful anxiety from my childhood thats coming to hunt me or just regular anxiety from starting a new venture. i smoked before the pod and was still nervous. but i still got it done which i am proud of.

My only difference that I've done was start taking vitamin supplements and paying attention to what I might be deficient in. It started out with Vitamin D and I also added Vitamin C supplements as well. It's no cure, as I still do get anxious, but no attacks, and I'm linking it to that. Since starting supplements, I've also just generally feel better (minus the depression I still face, but physically/mostly mentally).  


I know this might sound stupid and obvious, but I genuinely think that being deficient was one of my root causes."

856,Anxiety,im terrified of anything i eat or drink being drugged.,"im gonna add a trigger warning just incase. i talk about trauma, paranoia/anxiety/ocd.


so ive been dealing with something for about a year now, after i had a bad experience with my first (and l a s t) edible when i was 16. it was such a horrible experience, i did used to smoke weed and decided to take my first edible on new years with my old bestfriend. i thought i would be fine, but i practically ate the whole cookie while she only took a couple bites. i know its my fault entirely because it was my decision, but she didn't know how much was in it and didn't really warn me about how much i should eat. 

a while after the experience, everything was okay until i started having ""trauma dreams"" about tripping the fuck out and not being able to do anything about it, or accidentally eating something with weed or even drinking alcohol and absolutely freaking out. or taking something and being later told that its an edible and trying to make myself puke it up and waiting in fear for it to hit me.

and now, for almost a year, i check every single thing before i eat or drink it to make sure there's no ""thc"" in it. i read the ingredients carefully and examine the container, package, or bottle and i usually check it more than once incase ive missed something. if i forget and don't check it while im already eating, i start to get anxiety and i go back and check to make sure. that actually happened to me just now with the hot cocoa i made thats never been opened. 

some of the thoughts that go through my head are ""what if my parents accidentally left this out and no one was supposed to eat it because it has weed in it"" or ""what if they accidentally bought something with weed in it"" and so even when everyone's asleep, i absolutely have to wake up my mom and ask if something is okay to eat or drink because im scared it would have something in it. 

one of the reasons i hate going over to other people's houses is because im afraid to eat certain things. i have a rule in my head to not eat at anyone's house if they smoke weed or have anything to do with it because i could ingest something. at my cousins house, i grabbed a jar of pickles from the fridge and i was checking everything like usual but i still had to ask if it was okay to eat. 

its just food honestly, even touch gives me anxiety. my step dad used to smoke weed and he has his stuff in the garage and i was looking through his tools one day for tape and my mind immediately said ""wash your hands, now. do not touch your face, there could be weed wax on his tools and you just touched them"" and i booked it and washed my hands pretty hard. its even happened with tree sap. even with normal things, I worry that it could make me trip out if it gets in my mouth. it happens with flowers and plants and random substances on the counter or in a drawer. i always look up if certain things like that can mess you up. im terrified of nutmeg and i will not touch it or even smell it. i will not eat anything with nutmeg in it. my new deodorant has hemp seed oil in it and i was scared to use it at first. i know it wouldn't affect me though. 

after i eat, sometimes i sit there panicking, waiting for the ""drugs"" to kick in, and it never happens of course. 

this one time at my cousins house, the same cousin from before, it was thanksgiving in 2021 and their neighbor made a dish for us and i refused to eat it because 1, he makes me uncomfy and 2, i was afraid he laced it. he kept trying to get me to try it and it just made the thoughts worse, i kept thinking he WANTED me to get drugged or he got some weird sexual thing from it. i get thoughts like that a lot too :( 

i will not take anything from strangers or people we haven't seen in a while, i even hate the idea of trick or treating now, even though im 18 now. its hard to believe  younger me ate candy from completely random fucking strangers ya know? 

last year, it got to the point where my cousin had to be there with me and eat the same thing with me to assure me that it was okay, and id force myself to eat while thinking about the possibility of tripping out later and i would cry because i hated dealing with this and i hated the anxiety and i just wanted to eat normally. 

it doesn't matter if the package is sealed or not, my mind still thinks of a way that it could get drugged. like whoever made it or someone in the company or factory or whatever could've put something in it before sending it off. i also squeeze bags too, to make sure no air comes out. i feel stuck and unsafe :( i don't even wanna drink alcohol. im scared to take certain medications. i do take medication for my mental health and i really need new ones and a part of me is a lil nervous that the pills will make me feel ""high"" in a way. i had a procedure back in january and i was panicking because i had to be sedated and i was scared it would make me feel high, i did research and everything and asked friends but it didn't help. does anyone understand what im feeling?"

861,Anxiety,Public Speaking Anxiety,"To start I am a 19 year old male, who has had anxiety my entire life receiving a formal diagnosis when I was 15. Over the years I have learned to live with my general anxiety with only specific situations causing an increased response. A lot of this situational anxiety I have been able to overcome through repeated exposure such as my fear of amusement park rides, which I no longer have any issues with. 

Now onto the issue at hand, I have always had an irrational fear of public speaking which has gotten significantly better over the years again due to repeated exposure although I have seemed to hit a “plateau”. Interestingly over the years I discovered that this anxiety would only present itself when presenting to my peers or other people around my age. Anytime I present to those younger/older than me I have no issues whatsoever. 

I have also noticed that this anxiety does not seem to manifest itself consciously. Essentially, even though I tell myself that I am prepared, my presentation is good, others are in the same position as me, I am acting irrationally etc a response is still elicited. 

My theory is that my mind is subconsciously acting based off of a sort of association-based response stemming from social interactions during my childhood. 

As I am in university this has started to affect my performance with common symptoms being restlessness, profuse sweating, dizziness, feeling lightheaded and short term memory loss. This results in a detrimental effect that cannot be combated by methods such as preparing more, as no matter how prepared I am my thoughts turn into a disorganized mess. 

Treatments appear to consist of CBT, SSRI’s, benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers. 

I will admit I’m against taking SSRI’s as my anxiety only becomes  debilitating in certain situations as well as their side effects and long term effects. 

I also am somewhat against taking benzodiazepines due to their tendency to cause short term memory loss and their reported awful withdrawal although I would consider them if the benefit outweighed the risk.

CBT seems to have very mixed reviews but I guess couldn’t hurt to try.

Beta-blockers such as propranolol appear to have great efficacy for performance based anxiety so this seems to be the best option.

I would love to avoid exploring these avenues but it has gotten to a point where my performance in school is being hindered. 

Does anyone else suffer with something similar and if so what methods/medications have you found effective.
Any advice is welcomed. 

On a final note I have never been prescribed any medications for mental health issues and occasionally drink, vape, and smoke weed. I also do not consume Caffeine."
862,Anxiety,High + tired going to bed,"Felt some anxiety but breathed through it after I realized I was anxious??
I thought I had felt a tingling in my head and a few months ago I like hit a bag of ice on my head swinging it over and the doc said I should be fine... and go to the ER if I ever have a tingling in my neck or head *but* he said he doubts they would happen.


Well earlier I like bumped my head not even hard with my headphones on like leaking forward but that was hours ago but like 30 minutes ago I thought I felt a tingling almost but it could be me just needing rest cuz I didn’t get much sleep also it’s late now....

Was worries about being injured or whatever and worried is die? Weed paranoia? 😕😕

863,Anxiety,So i think that i am beyond help now. Now i just don't know what to do. TW.,"21F. No su!cidal stuff but i think I'm beyond saving. I think my previous even was not even OCD. I think i am actually a pervert and that i made a huge terrible mistake and i cannot be forgiven. I just don't know how to accept it. My chest feels heavy at the thought that i will need to carry this burden for the rest of my life. i don't deserve love or affection considering how bad i messed up. Feel like putting this up on social media too. Basically if yoh don't know what I'm refering to:
So i have OCD. 21F. I was at this party a few months ago. I had just started my medication after having a very bad time. My crush was there too. It was a pool party so he was showing in the bathroom in the bedroom. I am not sure if this event happened as i have false memories, however i remember going to the bedroom at one point and not telling him i was there hoping that my crush comes out naked (i mean with underwear) after showering and feels awkward after seeing me there. Now i doubt id make out with him because i haven't even had my first kiss. Max I'd want there to be a moment. But in hindsight, if this did happen, creepy as fuck. Secondly i don't know how to get over the guilt now. Help.
Don't help. If this happened, I'm a pervert and i might need to go to prison or something. I really feel like it did happen hence i don't know what to do. Guilt is a horrible emotion. Really."
864,Anxiety,advice needed!,i’ve noticed when i’m drunk i’m more in tune with my feelings I can actually feel. obviously I don’t want to depend on alcohol to feel my emotions; but it’s something i’ve observed. i’m also more motivated when drunk? i’m unsure what this is or if it has to do with prozac. but any Insight is helpful!!(:

867,Anxiety,Worried about germs,"So I cooked some dippy eggs this morning - but when I went to put one of them in the water I realised it was cracked - idk when this happened. I thought maybe I might be able to salvage it so I put it in the water anyway, but as you could expect all the egg white started leaking out. I already had another egg in that same water so I continued to soft boil that and then eat it. My question is, am
I at risk of the germs from that cracked egg getting into contact with the uncracked egg surface? And then me eating it?? Or would the boiling water have killed any bacteria from the cracked egg?"
868,Anxiety,Infection Anxiety,"Does anyone else suffer from anxiety about having been infected with Covid, after attending a social event or being on public transport?

I wear a mask, and I am vaxxed and boosted, but I still get very upset and nervous that I've caught Covid every time I've been exposed to people I don't know for any length of time.

I had Covid right at the beginning (wasn't hospitalised), and I have a mild version of Long Covid, and that worsened my asthma permanently.

I became quite mentally fragile during the first year or so of the pandemic, so I'm trying to reintegrate into the world, but this infection anxiety is absolutely overwhelming me.

I'm not very sure how to handle it, as there's no assurances I won't get it, but I feel like sometimes my reaction is overblown."
869,Anxiety,"Overwhelming emotions (catharsis?) AFTER finding successful treatment? Has anyone else experienced this? Did it get easier to feel ""normal""?","Hi all,

(Very brief tl;dr at the end for those who don't wish to read it all)

I did a really basic search with most of the key words in the title and I didn't really find anything similar to this. I also don't possess the wherewithal to look that hard.

Anyway, I recently had what I can only describe as a nervous breakdown. Like the whole façade I had built over my entire life just collapsed from both internal and external factors and caused an onslaught of mental, emotional, and physical symptoms at once. It lasted for about two weeks with varying degrees of intensity. It was terrifying, but I also think it was really important. I have been diagnosed with so many different things over the course of my life as the result of so many problems of my own invention. The real *problem* though, is that I have been constantly worried my entire life. When that aforementioned façade collapsed, I felt completely lost. 

I was able to get in to see my psychiatrist unusually quickly because of a cancellation. I just told him, flat out, ""I have anxiety (it's understandable he missed it because I only ever seek treatment when I give up), I don't want SSRIs (took for several kinds for several years and none had any effect), and I don't want benzos (personal feelings about this type of drug)."" Then I just simply asked for help. We had a long conversation which outlined a number of adjunctive and complementary treatment options beyond simply the pharmacological ones.

It has been two weeks and last Friday was the first day in as long as I can remember that I was not worried. It took that day to help me truly understand that every day up until that one, I had spent worried. The moment I realized that, I collapsed on my floor bawling and I just really let it all out. It felt so good, but so intense; so joyful for the process of healing and improving to begin, while simultaneously grieving how much time has been wasted always worrying. 

What's happening now, although they have not been as intense as the first one, it seems like every day or night there is a wave of overwhelming emotion and I just let it out--happy and sad at the same time. I have always been an emotional person, so the thought that I somehow have repressed emotions is mind-boggling. I just can't think of how else to describe it. Like I'm still the same me that I have always been, but now it feels like a dam has been broken that blocked certain feelings, expressions, or emotional depth from my conscious mind.

I feel like I am experiencing life normally, it's exciting and I know I'm improving, but it's also overwhelming and scary. Like it would have been easier to just remain an anxious wreck, but I would have literally ripped myself apart if I didn't seek help.

So I just want to ask if anyone else has experienced anything like this? Like happy anxiety (is this catharsis?) from feeling like whatever treatment you have found to work for you? Does this get less overwhelming? Did you find anything helpful in making the change sustainable after the honeymoon phase with feeling ""normal"" ended? The little internal dialogue in my head also wants me to ask if this feeling of normalcy is actually just me going completely crazy, but I'm not going to because my heart tells me that's not true.

Thank you for taking the time to read all of this. It has been a wild experience, living life, and I look forward to continuing until its natural end.

TL;DR: Had nervous breakdown. Realized I have anxiety. Finally advocated to my doctor that I have anxiety and need help. Help actually seems to be working. Help has created feeling of normalcy, normalcy has created overwhelming emotions that come each day. Normalcy is kind of scary. Can you relate? Are you scared of normal too?"
870,Anxiety,"How to deal with being extremely anxious, please??","School starts tomorrow and I feel really anxious. Last night I woke up like 3 times and my heart was racing so bad and today when i woke up my heart was racing even faster, my head hurts and I feel nauseous I can't do it anymore I swear I need to study but I can't. I am literally lying in my bed becauee I feel like passing out. How to stop feeling so anxious??"
871,Anxiety,Anxiety in PE,"(Sorry for my bad english) 

I am not good at sports, mainly bcs I don't like to sport in front of people so I barely practice and when I do, I never go all in bcs I'm afraid that I will look crazy or weird and people will laugh at me. So I never have good points for PE and everyone assumes I'm just really bad at sports even though I know I could be better but I never say or show that.
For PE we need to wear either wide shorts or girls can also wear sport pants that are really 'skinny' and I don't like to wear them bcs they make me feel fat but I do wear them bcs if I wear shorts everyone will see that I pick my skin and I have a lot of scars as a result.
There are these girls in my class that always laugh and judge people in pe not only me but also a lot of other people. Especially this one girl is always really judgy, I was in a team with her multiple times and everytime I messed up she would sigh and give me dirty looks and made me feel worse about every mistake I made wich made me play even worse. Luckily there were other people even of opposite teams that see this and try to encourage me. For example 2 weeks ago we had volleyball and I was with that one girl and 2 other friends in a group and she was bitchy to me in rhe evaluation like she had enough of me and after the evaluation it became worse, she was complaining the whole time how it sucked and sighing every time I couldn't catch a ball even though she didn't even throw it well to me. At this point I had enough so I turned my back on her didn't look at her anymore and didn't pass to her. Even though I still felt bad every time I missed. My friends were really supportive even when I missed, they gave me tips and said that I was getting better wich made me feel better. 

On a semi unrelated note: 
This week we had rope skipping and I'm really good at that but like always I didn't go all in bcs the girls were laughing on how stupid I and some other people looked (this happened the most during warm ups were we would be in line and I was last in line so I had the whole class watching me). After warm us we needed to learn a new trick every 4 min and I picked them all up really fast but every time I jumped I felt like an idiot so after one or two minutes I would stop and say that my asthma (which I have but not severe) was not so good lately and I was tired wich was true but I was able to do more. But in 2 weeks we are going to get evaluated and that gives me even more anxiety bcs we are going to need to do 40 counts (5 tricks for 8 counts) without hesitating or stopping wich is really hard for me to do bcs my anxiety make it so I can't breath bcs I always feel like there is a pressure on my lungs so I wouldn't be able to do more then like 3 tricks even though I can do them all I'm really scared and really don't wanna go to pe anymore.

I have had multiple anxiety attacks in pe and every time I go I feel more and more insecure I really don't know what to do anymore and really need some advice on how to deal with my anxiety for all of this basically 

Thank you for reading this"

873,Anxiety,I'm going to try and stop Catastrophizing!,"For months I've been Catastrophizing. I only learned about the term today. I thought I was just purely anxious before I learned about it. It's so re-assuring to know it's a real thing and I'm not going loopy.

&amp;#x200B;

It's almost always to do with my girlfriend. I'm overprotective and jealous. It's probably rooted somewhere in my teenage years. There's a few things I can think of related to where it started. But she thinks the world of me and is always there for me. She's the woman I want to tackle life with. We're getting engaged in the summer. 

&amp;#x200B;

She always sees past my catastrophizing and loves me for me. She's unbelievably supportive. I'm not just doing this for me. I'm doing this for her. And our future family. From today, I'll try my absolute best rationalize my thoughts instead of jumping to the absolute worst case scenario. It's not going to be easy, but it's the least I can do. I'm so excited to learn and grow."
874,Anxiety,I think it's time I face the music,"I've been having anxiety and I think its finally reached a point where I should search for some sort of cure or at least something to help ease this. It's turning into panic attacks and preventing me from sleeping or even thinking straight once it hits bad. I just don't know what help I can get considering I can't think of what could be causing this :/ worst part is ive always been a solid/hard person and now that i'm hurting emotionally im worried there's not many I can talk to that are close to me without them looking at me differently.

I just want a distraction,  atleast till I can fall asleep and get through this one :(

Btw this is the furthest I have come with being open about this, I hope this leads me to something good"
875,Anxiety,Can i pause therapy?,"I've been on therapy for three months now and i was taking weekly sessions since.
I have social anxiety, generalised, and OCD with mild depression. I'm also using cipralex for one month now.

I feel like I'd like a break from therapy but i don't know for how long and I'm afraid that I'll need help during the exams but at the same time, i want to find the lost me and restore it.

I want to forget about the situations that stress me and what to say to my therapist or to even THINK.

877,Anxiety,Overthinking Life,Does anyone else feel like when you have had a good day you’re anxiety can sometimes be worse then when you’ve had a bad day ?

878,Anxiety,Physical symptoms,"Hey guys. I wanted to ask you what your physical symptoms are when you suffer with severe bouts of anxiety. Do you suffer tight chest, muscle pain, lymph node swelling and inflammation? I’m trying to figure out if these are all connected. I’ve never known anxiety to have this many physical side effects. 


The last week or so, mine has been so  severe to the point where I’ve had so much physical discomfort as well as uncontrollable panic attacks. I didn’t even know it was possible until I felt one today whilst talking on a live meeting. It’s like gasping for air and feeling everything tighten up, I just wonder if this is common. Thank you."
879,Anxiety,Current events,"Hi everyone first time here but I’m so anxious with everything that’s going on. I know everyone else is of course but I’m literally losing sleep over this and I’m a big ball of anxiety. I’m afraid it can go nuclear and it’s so sad that we are living through times like this. I cant take myself away from the news bc the thought of something turning worse sits on my mind. I read the news hoping for some hope but I feel like every time I read, it gets worse. I feel like I’m going insane and keep having anxiety attacks."
880,Anxiety,i think my mum gave me my anxiety,"all throughout my childhood and even now in my adult life my mum has done so many things that have messed up mine and my siblings mental health. and the other day she found out that my brother had been confiding in his girlfriend about her behaviour and she got really upset saying that her childhood was worse and that he has no right to be complain to his girlfriend about her being emotionally abusive..

there's been times in my childhood where she locked my dad out the house and me and my siblings were screaming and crying trying to fight her to open the door and let him in. there's been times she has attacked my dad in public (one time at a theme park she scratched my dad's back so bad that it left scars)..

another time she put me and my siblings in her car and chased after my dad in his car when she found out that the sport event he was attending also had a woman in attendance (she doesn't like my dad being around women or even listening to women on the radio). and she was on the phone to him while she was chasing him with us in the back of the car screaming at him down the phone that she was going to crash our car into his and i quote ""kill all of us""

another thing she's done probably about 5 or 6 times throughout the years is opened her door while driving at 60mph on the motorway and threatening to jump out and kill herself because she was having an argument with my dad. all I remember is me and my siblings crying and pleading in the back for her not to jump out.

and im pretty sure once or twice I've walked into the kitchen and my mum was holding a knife up while arguing with my dad.

now im 21 and still living with them and still these things continue. im saving up to get out this house and doing well in college to hopefully get a good paid job. but it's hard to keep studying and keep up motivation when theres always awful stuff happening in the house. literally as i was typing this a massive argument erupted between my mum and brother and they just finished screaming at eachother. last year my parents had a huge vicious argument between them and it sent me into a panic attack in front of them (i was in the same room at the time) and ive never had one before but i just instinctively curled up in the corner and sat there shaking for half an hour before I could calm down while my mum was stood there looking at me like i was crazy and telling me to stop being dramatic. then my dad came up later and told me to stop crying because we were about to visit my grandparents and he didn't want me to ruin it by showing up with puffy red eyes

im sure all of these things have added up over the years and made me extremely anxious. I can never get too close to people and i have little trust for anyone. I'm constantly worried that I've angered people and I chalk that up to constantly walking on eggshells my whole childhood so that my mum wouldn't start screaming at me. I could accidentally leave the cap off a tube of toothpaste and she would go red in the face and yell at the top of her lungs for about 20 minutes straight. I'm sure the neighbours hate us..

anyway i just wanted to post this because i have no friends or anyone to talk to about it with. i need to escape this house but i just can't afford it. I'm stuck here alone with absoloutely no friends and mountains of college work to do. idk sorry this was word vomit and I don't think I've coherently described my life and everything my mum has done - it's way too much to squeeze into 1 reddit post but it just angers me how my mum will do all these things and then switch to pretending to be a perfect mother who's never done a single thing wrong and that me and my siblings shouldn't be affected in the slightest by the emotional trauma she's given all of us"
881,Anxiety,GERD and heart palpitations,"Dear all, my partner lives with anxiety disorder and experiences heart palpitations during the night almost regularly.

882,Anxiety,Car buying when buying is a trigger,"When I was in college, before I met my now-wife, I often didn’t have enough money. I had days when I just didn’t eat. I was supposed to be covered, but wasn’t, but we won’t go into details of family politics here and now. Suffice it to say, I don’t like spending money.

Yesterday I went out and traded in our minivan for a used SUV. It was time, the van was getting long in the tooth and we needed something different. I was actually starting to dread driving the van. 

While I remained calm and smiling on the outside the entire time, it was rough doing that. Came home with the new car, took a klonapin, and laid down for a nap. 

But wait, there’s more coming up! Next I have to call up our insurance and get that changed! And I have to take in the old plate and register the new car! More spending, yay! 

But it was the good thing to do. And my very knowledgeable on the subject father in law tells me I negotiated a great deal on it."
883,Anxiety,Does anyone else experience this?,"I've always had bad anxiety, since I was young. Normally it's about what most people experience, but maybe a bit more intense. However it's still manageable and I can still function.

Sometimes however, I get HUGE waves of anxiety that last week's, making it impossible to function or enjoy anything. I find myself having panic attacks at random moments and the triggers aren't always consistent. These waves end up dying down eventually, but they are completely unbearable.

891,Anxiety,People are becoming tired,"Short background: In February 2020 suddenly my life changed. During physical education my heart went out of rithm and was very very fast. My PE teacher called an ambulance. I've done exams for heart, blood ecc...  All good. After this episode I developed severe panic attacks and two times I went to the hospital. One good teacher suggested me to see a psychologist, so I did just that. It's been 2 years and I'm still in therapy. I'm better now, but still I have some minor panic attacks and I don't go out. I also avoid every human interaction, like going outside. The problem is: at the beginning friends, teachers, family were very supportive. My friends left me alone, so I didn't strees myself to go out, my teachers gave me extra lesson for free and my parents supported my psychology sessions and supported also morally. Now, after 2 years, people are getting tired. Friends don't call me anymore, teachers started to be nervous and my parents say that I'm wasting my life. Basically now I'm alone fighting my own mind and I really don't have the strength to fight back. Srry for my English."
892,Anxiety,How do I get out of a dissociative state?,"Basically, my BIL whom I’m no fan of and my in laws are all pro guns, which is fine. I haven’t been around it so I’m not used to it. My FIL has a gun room with about 30+ guns in which they are only meant to handle them etc in. BIL keeps his guns there so he comes to get them when he goes out shooting. I live there atm (long story, feeling too weird today to get into it).

BIL is arrogant, shows off every chance he gets and makes constant digs at everyone when he’s around, when he leaves someone is always upset. He especially hates my husband as he feels threatened that he’s younger and more successful, I know he doesn’t like me and I don’t care. When he’s around the 2 of us he goes above and beyond to “one up” us. I avoid him as much as I can. Unfortunately, I could not avoid him yesterday.

He went shooting, came in with my SIL and while we were all talking, my husbands back faced to me so he didn’t see anything, he takes out his shot gun and cocks it infront of me. I jumped and he looks at me and says with a smirk “ohhh I love that sound” I ignore him and carry on my conversation. I look again and he has another gun in his hand, looking at it like he’s examining it and pointing it right at me. I may not shoot but I know you don’t point a gun at anyone. I thought nah, he can’t be doing it on purpose so I moved 3 times and he changed position and still aimed it at me everytime. I went straight next to my husband and he stopped. 

It was like I didn’t realize at the time what was happening until they left. I actually forgot about it for an hour, it was like I lost my memory it was crazy. It hit me hard when I remembered and told my husband. He is furious, he told me my BIL knows he’s not meant to take the guns out outside of the room etc. Sorry, I really don’t have the energy for the entire story.

From the second it hit me what had happened, I’ve been having major anxiety and a dissociative episode. I slept for 4 hours, my head hurts, I feel like I’m on the verge of collapsing and I can’t shake feeling dissociative. I feel completely out of body, everything around me feels like a movie. I do not want to feel like this, I’m mad at myself for letting someone like that make me feel like this. I want to feel like myself, anything I do to get myself back please?

I work from home so I’m alone when he comes around to pick up guns etc and I don’t feel safe."

894,Anxiety,"Anxiety relating to death/passing time hits me right as I try to sleep, or in the middle of the night. It’s getting worse. I have no idea how to control it.","Hi all. 

I’ve never been diagnosed with anxiety but I’m starting to suspect I have it. In the past six months or so I’ve been experiencing something really upsetting when I’m lying in bed trying to sleep, or when I wake up in the middle of the night and am still sort of dozing. It just hits me that I’m going to die someday and that time is passing and it FREAKS me out. I obviously know I’m going to die. But this intrusive thought feels incredibly scary because it’s REAL (aka, yes I will die someday), and it comes on out of nowhere. It’s terrifying. It used to only happen every couple of weeks but now it’s practically daily whenever I try and sleep, and it’s starting to bleed into my day and making me constantly think about death and time passing. 

Nothing specific brought this on. I’ve also only just turned 27 years old, so it’s not like I’m old or hit a milestone birthday. I have no idea how to manage this but I feel like I can’t go on like this. It’s making me miserable and scared and detracting from my joy. 

Has anyone else dealt with this sort of anxiety specifically? If so, how do you manage / overcome it? Does anyone have any advice for me?"
895,Anxiety,Does anxiety makes you struggle with your partner?,"I've been dating her for almost 2 years since we broke up (we still talk) and the main reason we did is because of her anxiety 
She tells me she has feelings for me still, sometimes tells me she still wants me and saying she love me but later, a day after or something she ignores or she barely respond then saying she has hard time to decide if she loves me or not
Ever since our relationship began being really bad I started dealing with anxiety too, but for me it just makes me want her or be with her more then before 
She said I make her happy and she still care, then later saying she don't know if she want me in her life
So my question is, is there anyone here that deals with that too? When you don't know what you guys want with your partner?
I really don't know if it's actually her anxiety or just don't wanna talk to me at all"
896,Anxiety,I really needed to hear this and this might help - what is it that your anxiety wants from you,"So I subscribe to many therapy channels on youtube and today I was suggested this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96zzrgH_J34

The point that hit me hard was:

&gt; What does your anxiety want from you?

&gt; What does your anxiety want you to do?

&gt; What does your anxiety always end up doing?

If you sit and introspect just a little, not much, on these, you might be able to identify the thought patterns that start your specific anxiety and thought patterns that constitute your specific anxiety and finally, the patterns of temporary resolution. You might not get resolution at all (GAD, anxiety for weeks till one day you get up not being broken and so on)

When I did this exercise I saw:

**My anxiety is a big coward bully, that once scared, starts throwing a tanrum in my nervous system**, activating all my fear circuits and pushing up my heart beat, pumping out adrenaline, generally making my body and mind unliveable, in the hope that its fear goes away. It is adamantly convinced that  throwing a tantrum is the only way to solve a fear or problem or danger depsite the rest of mind knowing fully well that problems are always ever solved only by calm thinking, steadfast emotions and assertion rather than avoidance.

So, in my case, **anxiety takes the form of a bullying, adamant, stupid child unwilling to listen or change its behaviour, very egoistic and very dumb**

Also, it's like a part of me is anti-me, but not actually, because anxiety is functional, a pattern of behaviour, a collection of bad habits, not a fundamentally broken brain. 

I have OCD in which there is also self-sabotage by way of mischief (which was basically a coping mechanism to fight depression once upon a time) and there is also a persistent neurological ""pulsing"" or spiking of impulses that never ceases. Sometimes these impulses push the fear system, sometimes they push the limbic system (trembling, flinching), other times, provoke euphoria and excitement and still other times, sexual organs (unexpected unwanted body arousal when mind is preoccupied with some work or chore). 

While I have no solution yet for the neurological impulses apart from ignoring, controlling or shaking them off, I believe asking and remembering **What does my anxiety actually want me to do** makes me see the bigger picture and **pulls me out of anxiety's trap and cage** and I can see I am going to repeat the same stupid pattern again for the millionth time.

**This prevents the pattern from repeating because somehow the anxious mind gets wind of the fact the cycle is the same well known routine and there are no surprises, which means no danger**.

Hope this helps someone."
897,Anxiety,Does anyone have any tips regarding concentration?,"I get these weird intrusive images of places and just stuff almost all the time , it is really making it difficult to concentrate. It makes concentrating on anything really difficult, when i watching any media or using social media there are definitely not there which definitely helps by creating distraction , but I always end up wasting time , and then thinking i could have done something about it. It's only when i am unable to shut these intrusive images i keep scrolling on social media apps , is there any tips or suggestions to concentrate? 
Ps: ignore the grammatical errors please."
898,Anxiety,I don’t know what to do,"I don’t feel here. I feel like I’m dead or Im dying or somethings going to happen to me. I don’t know how to explain it but I just don’t feel here. I’m having such bad anxiety and I don’t know why, and when I try to think all I can think about it something bad happened and that I’m not really here. I think I’m going crazy and I don’t know what to do."
899,Anxiety,"My landlord is selling our rental and just told us yesterday evening, &amp; I have to deal with people being in my personal space tomorrow and then possibly every Saturday until the end of February. I have issues with this and I don’t know if I can cope. (Possible trigger warning)","I have cptsd amongst other diagnosis’. I keep reminding myself that it isn’t that big of a deal. I have the choice to be here but our home is so small that it is extremely awkward to be in while people are looking around, especially at our stuff that includes my own personal artwork that I’m super self conscious of. My social anxiety is horrible and I’ve been going through a really hard time as of lately.
When I was younger I had a very invasive dad that would rummage through my room and journals and then beat me if he found something he didn’t like. I also had a neighbor friend who ended up being a creep and breaking in to our house and stealing me, my sisters, and my moms underwear, and taking them to school and showing them off to other boys. The embarrassment and feeling of being violated haunted me. Later on I found out he molested my friends and younger sister. I also had neighbor boys that would knock on my window in the middle of the night and run away so I always felt paranoid someone was watching me. Besides all that I was sexually abused by a family member and my trust n everyone was forever tainted.  My last experience with a landlord was a mess bc the maintenance men would walk in while I was sleeping and one time showering during the day and I never felt safe. Now this! I don’t want people to look or have access to my personal stuff but I have no choice. I’m suppose to be looking for a new job and a new home while packing up everything I own but I feel like I’m on the brink of a breakdown and I feel stupid because of it. I know logiscslly most likely it will be okay butt I have thIs feeling of not feeling safe. I have a feeling that creeper will end up going through my personal items. I have this feeling of having my personal space/safe space being violated and they haven’t even had a walk through yet. I know I’m overreacting and I hate myself for it. I hate myself for crying. I’m scared of this whole month. I wish I don’t have these problems. I don’t even know why I’m ranting. I don’t think I have itin me to reply to anyone. I just feel like a jumbled mess and a loser. I wish this fear would go away. I wish I don’t have to rent. I’m scared of panic attacks bc I disassociate sometimes and start harming myself. IAnxiet and trauma is so fkn stupid. I honestly hate myself. I’m going to try my best but it’s still just so fkn hard. :("
900,Anxiety,I don’t know what just happened. (Storytime/Question),"     Jumping into it; I was sitting in the kitchen with a friend and my dad. Anymore I kind of want to distance myself from this friend. My dad and this friend were having a political discussion. I used to have these all of the time, and then my anxiety started getting the best of me. Today was my first day of work, one hour of sleep, political discussion, crazy ass tension headache, nicotine, anger, growing dislike for this friend, BOOM. I just had this spontaneous and wild attack of sorts where my heart rate went nuts and anxiety through the roof. It subsided within’ 10-15 minutes but it drove me up the wall. Long story short; I interrupted, put my arm around my dads neck and just kind of hung there for a second to calm it. Can I still call myself a man?"
901,Anxiety,Any tips for someone who obsessively overthinks?,"I can’t go a day, an hour without overthinking. My mind is constantly going and going. I can’t stop it. I’ve tried distracting myself and doing hobby’s but bad thoughts always find a way. Depression and anxiety have gotten worse and I feel stuck. I need any help I can get. 
Thank you all so very much ❤️"
902,Anxiety,Etiquette for staying at a friend’s place?,"I’m visiting a new city soon and a newish friend/crush has offered to have me stay and show me around. I’m a bit anxious about what we’re going to eat, should I bring a gift etc. They have a flatmate as well who I don’t know and I feel nervous about making a good impression with them too!

What’s the norm with eating at a friend’s place? Who buys the food, who cooks etc? I’m their guest but I don’t want to take advantage 😅"
903,Anxiety,Speaking for long periods of time gives me anxiety,"For example, when I participate in class discussions, I start to hyperventilate if I have to talk for a long time. I can talk in front of people for a little while, but when its longer than that, I feel like my body goes into flight or fight mode. Even talking to my therapist, makes me feel like this sometimes. (This also could be because of my performance anxiety/public speaking anxiety). In a little under a week, I'll be starting my 2nd semester of college and now I'm stressing about talking in my classes. Has anyone had similar experiences with this or advice?"
904,Anxiety,Anyone have experience with sedated MRIs?,"I have an MRI of my wrist tomorrow afternoon. It'll be ~25 minutes in a not so great position for claustrophobia. I'll be face down, arm extended in front of my head and then head first into the machine. I don't know that I'd label my claustrophobia as extreme, but it's probably on the upper side of moderate. That said, adding in I started having panic attacks ~6 months ago (just in general, not directly related to claustrophobia) and I'm a bit more concerned about how I'll handle things.

I've had 2 MRIs in the past (before panic attacks) both of the same hip and my head was basically just in line with the entrance side of the machine. So essentially sticking out maybe 4-6 inches or so, and I was OK, but not great. Still had to try relatively hard to not freak out.

I spoke to the wrist specialist who ordered the MRI and she prescribed me 3 tablets of 1mg Xanax for 30 minutes before the MRI. I was told start with one and if I still feel anxious take another, but that doesn't really leave much of a window for the second one to take effect. I've used .25mg in the past for panic attacks and they worked pretty great for knocking the anxiety out, but I didn't really feel sedated or anything.

I know they probably see it a lot, but I don't want to be that guy that freaks out and has to reschedule. Even knowing they see it plenty, it's still embarrassing.

Long post all to get around to this, do benzos really work that well for MRIs? They offered to put me to sleep for it, but that seemed extreme for what amounts to 25 minutes or less of a procedure. Just curious what other's experience may have been like in similar situations."
905,Anxiety,help with health anxiety,"wanna start this rant off with i do have a therapist lol. i just still wanna see what tips you guys have on here. so i have a lot of health anxiety, mostly just i start getting super anxious about possible diseases i could have or could get in the future, i start thinking i should make appointments just to check and make sure absolutely nothings wrong with me (even tho i have no symptoms and i do go to yearly checkups) i’m getting laser tattoo removal in a few days so that’s definitely made it spike because i’m super worried about it but also just need this tattoo off. in the past few months i’ve also had that sort of realization that death is inevitable and i think that feeds into my health anxiety as well lol. sorry if this was all over the place just looking for any tips if any of you struggle with this too!"
906,Anxiety,First job interview,"After years of being an unemployed socially anxious person, I finally went to an online job interview!

I've accepted at this point that I'll probably not get the job. It was a mess! I haven't used English for so long, that I stuttered and paused a lot of times.
But I'm glad I did it. Gosh, there were even roosters crowing in the background because I live in a farm area lmao. Mortifying at the time, but a funny thought to me now.

Any job interview tips? What are your tricks when your mind blanks out and you don't know what to say?"
907,Anxiety,If you struggle with anxiety like most of us in this sub probably do I just wanted to recommend a book Im reading that is making me feel SO heard and seen right now that I never have felt - “Notes on a Nervous Planet” by Matt Hang.,Im not a reader and I get bored easily but this book explaining what’s it’s like to be me to me is really bringing some things up that I couldn’t put my finger on and helping in a way that feels significant. This author is amazing.
908,Anxiety,Anyone have personal experience/ stories about managing anxiety with THC and/ or CBD? Especially for those of you using low doses for sleep. It has worked wonders for me for sleep and panic attacks (in addition to weekly therapy sessions). I figure it’s this or benzodiazepines. Thank you!,
909,Anxiety,"Can't get meds from psychiatrist, thinking to killing myself because this anxiety is killing me","I have trauma in past which made me develop this severe anxiety and panic disorder, I'll kill myself asap today so the pain can stop"
910,Anxiety,Crippling fear of socializing?,"I've let my social anxiety take control and now it controls me. It's more than social anxiety at this point, I don't know what to call it. Everybody seems to think it's not that bad, but it's so much worse than they think. I don't even feel safe in my apartment. I hear someone knock at my door and I feel a sense of paralyzing fear. I can't bring myself to move and it feels like my heart is in my throat. This is why I'm afraid to go into public, let alone leave my house. I've wanted to get prescriptions for this but ironically I need to go see a psychiatrist. I don't know what to do at this point and it feels like my life is ruined"
911,Anxiety,Any teas out there that help with anxiety?,Honestly want to try to find anything that can help with anxiety before hitting the meds. I'm afraid of the side effects and being dependent on them for the rest of my life.
912,Anxiety,Anxious about Covid isolation/ rant,"I just tested positive for Covid for the second time (last time was in early March 2021). I’m fully vaxxed and boosted and so far it’s much more mild than the last time I had Covid. As of right now I am just feeling exhausted and achey. 
I’m not really anxious about getting more sick but I’m in college and they had to transport me to a whole separate campus for isolation. It was so embarrassing packing all my stuff and waiting for the shuttle and having everyone know right where I was going. Being here makes me really anxious because it’s out of routine. The beds are uncomfortable and they didn’t give me many blankets. I also don’t know anyone who is here right now and I’m not feeling up to socializing (we all have Covid so they let us go outside and hang out with each other at certain times of the day). 
I’m worried I won’t get any work done here and I will fall super behind at school. I don’t want to have to play catch up especially because my motivation has been so low lately anyway. 

Ig that’s all for now I think I just needed to rant"
913,Anxiety,I have been having a lot of moment where my heart won’t stop racing. sometimes it hurts and I can’t breath. Also I start to get angry. I don’t understand where this came from.,"I had some things to deal with, which gave me a big deal of stress. I decided to get a tattoo today. I had i had it scheduled for 4:30 and before I even left the house my mom and sister started yelling and for some reason I started shaking and I felt tell sick and I wanted to cry.  And when my mom started asking me questions I yelled at her and we had a fight. My heart hurts now and it’s all I can thing about. I’ve dealt with my depression and other things but I never got to experience this kind of anxiety. I really don’t know how I can fix it. But the thing that throws me off more is I’ve never felt like this so why start now when I’m 19."
914,Anxiety,Non-benzo anxiety relief?,"It’s so much easier to go to sleep after I’ve taken a benzodiazepine like Xanax. I know this isn’t the best solution, and oftentimes I can’t take one because i’ve had a drink or two of alcohol. However, if I don’t have one, my anxiety is so high trying to sleep. I feel nauseous and my heart pounds. Is there anything I can do to replace benzos that will help me calm down to sleep?"
915,Anxiety,How to deal with intrusive thoughts?,"I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, but I'm kinda just trying to gauge whether I really *need* to spend $120 for a GP visit or if there are other solutions I can try at home.

I've always had intrusive thoughts. Whenever I'm holding a knife while eating, I get a quick image of doing something with it other than cutting meat. They were few and far between, and not a regular occurrence. 

Lately it's been constant. I want to be clear: I would NEVER act on these thoughts. That is absolutely not my concern. It's just, when I have these thoughts several times a day, it can be distressing. You ever have a dream where you or someone you love gets hurt, and when you wake up you feel like shit even though you know it's a dream? That's what I'm dealing with.

Just having these thoughts - and the sometimes vivid mental image that accompanies them - is sending my anxiety through the roof. I don't even have to be holding a knife to get these thoughts anymore. A couple times I've been on my way back upstairs with a glass bowl of hot food, and I see my mom on the couch. I'll let you imagine what my thoughts are in that moment. 

I would love to try something that doesn't involve actual medical services. Worst-case scenario if I don't go to the doctor is these thoughts keep upsetting me. Worst-case scenario if I DO go to the doctor is a 45 minute wait, 10 minutes of nurse taking my vitals, and 5 minutes of the doctor explaining in a professional way that it's not a big deal and to just deal with it. Oh, and a $240 bill.

I'm not asking for medical advice, aside from if you think I should go to the doctor. I'm looking for breathing/thought exercises, or just about anything I can try before seeking costly help."
916,Anxiety,"I faced my biggest fear. Not only that, I loved every moment.","I'd like to share my story but I'm doubtful anyone would particularly care to read 4 or 5 paragraphs. So, long story short, I faced my biggest fear. In a way, I was forced to face it. I was 99.9% sure that not only would I fail, but that I would set myself back. The exact opposite happened. 12 years of panic disorder and agoraphobia feel foreign to me now. I waited for the initial high to wear off so I could fairly assess my mental state and any changes. I can honestly say that my life has done a 180. I'm not who I was. If anyone is interested in me going into detail, I'll write out my story. If not, please take one thing with you..all it takes is ONE action to change everything. However you feel. Whatever you ""can't"" do..it's bullshit. You truly can squash your anxiety into a quiet and pathetic puddle with ONE action. Only you know what the action is, though."
917,Anxiety,How do I get rid of this heavy feeling since I got 2:00 grade in one of my subject,"You know it feels like my world is falling apart....
I know Its not something that I should worry but.. it really feels devastated and I feel like I lost all of my Inspiration 

I got 2:00 on one of my subject and I feel like my grade to the other subject is also lower... It felt really hard... damnn Im so sensitive..  

I GOT NO ONE TO TALK ABOUT SO I DONT KNOW HOW SHOULD I CHEER UP MYSELF..

Pls... help me... my anxiety is overwhelming me.... so much that my heart might exploded... 

And also im overthinking noww....."
918,Anxiety,Help with holding breath in large crowds,"Background: Anxiety, depression (not sure what type), and nuerodivergent (most likely a mix of autism and ADHD, only diagnosed autistic)

Does anyone else hold their breath for long periods of time while out and about alone? Whenever I walk around campus, i hold my breath when I'm near loads of people, in groups, alone, in pairs, any amount of people. I'm not 100% certain why I'm so anxious at this point, or if maybe it's something else, but I don't usually realize I'm doing it until I'm dying for air and breathe really heavily, increasing my anxiety because I'm breathing weirdly and too loudly in front of other people. 

If anyone has any tips to help, that would be amazing. I've tried having headphones in, with and without music, with and without active noise cancelling and with and without transparency mode (allowing more noise to pass through), I've also tried various types of music (ranging from dream pop, metal &amp; deathcore, pop music, acoustics, and stuff that usually relaxes me) and I've tried just being on my phone the entire time so I don't have to look at anyone. I don't know anyone on campus yet, but once I do, maybe I could walk with them? I would rather be more independent though, if possible."
919,Anxiety,Years of anxiety and I don’t think I can take it anymore.,"TW for sort of suicidal thoughts

Title about sums it up. I’ve tried multiple different medications over the years, various forms of therapy, exercise, diets, no smoking, no drinking. But I can’t stop feeling anxious. I hardly sleep anymore, and if I do it’s only for about 3 hours at a time then I wake up with my heart pounding out of my chest. Gotta get up and make sure the door is locked, make sure I didn’t leave my wallet at the restaurant, make sure I didn’t lose my keys. Then once that’s settled I sit there thinking through the day, all the little missteps, that I’m going to be fired from my job and then I’ll lose my house, my car, I’ll be homeless, my life will be ruined and I’ll die alone and homeless under a bridge. Then I think ‘well maybe I can go for a walk and calm down’, then that leads me to thinking of all the horrible things that could happen if I leave the house alone at night without my partner. Then I spin into wondering why my partner is even with someone like me, that he’s going to leave for someone normal, that I’m going to anxious and irritable towards him one day and it’ll be the last straw and he’ll leave me and I’ll be alone. So here I am sitting on the couch at 2AM, shaking with anxiety, heart pounding, work in 3 hours and I can’t sleep because I feel like any second I’m going to die. 

My partner knows I have anxiety, but I don’t think he knows how bad it is. No one knows how bad it is. I get told a lot that I’m overreacting, getting worked up for nothing. I seemingly function well, I have a job and keep that mask on all the time when inside I feel like I’m about to die or my life is about to fall apart. To me it feels like everything, it’s just this all consuming thing on my back that won’t let me breathe. My therapists tell me I have a chemical imbalance and I need to just find coping mechanisms. I’ve tried hobbies, gaming, knitting, writing, painting, but then when I go to bed it just all comes back. My hands shake, I hardly eat, I vomit nearly once a day just from the anxiety making me sick. I can’t keep going like this. It’s been years since I’ve had a full nights sleep. I’m so so tired."

921,Anxiety,Anxiety management?,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone could share the ways that they manage their anxiety that do not include medication?"
922,Anxiety,Looks like my life is ruined because I have fallen into this habit of not being to able to sleep even for a minute when there is a important event the next day and I know that I have to wake up early for it. This has happened twice in this month already.,"The next day I don't feel like eating anything. I get a headache. I feel like puking even though I haven't eaten. I feel like I am stuck in waking state. It feels like the worse hours of my life till I am able to go to bed the coming night. I somehow push through the day... doing my job in a tired, depressed face. And when night arrives, I fall asleep easily(brain doesnt have enough energy for any anxiety). But its sucks that I don't get any sleep on the day I REALLY need it. And I sleep fairly well when I know the next day is going to be a usual day.  


I am not even exaggerating any of the above. It seems some kind of reverse psychology trap I have fallen to. I don't even want to know the side effects my body and mind is going through because of zero sleep."
923,Anxiety,Inflammation/body swelling all over body?,"Hey guys, this might be strange or could be normal I have no idea hence I’m asking lol. Does anyone experience all over body swelling when they’re super stressed or anxious? And it doesn’t go away unless somehow your in a state of relaxation which could take weeks? 
The inflammation is all over and I’ve taken an SSRI once before for a few days and all the sudden the inflammation went down because it’s like I was calmer and sleeping better."
924,Anxiety,Time off,"I took 2 weeks off of work to deal with a particularly bad anxiety attack. Now, I can't stop feeling bad about resting while everyone's working."
925,Anxiety,Snow storm,"Since my worsening anxiety and panic snow storms freak me out so bad. We’re expecting *a lot* of snow Saturday, blizzard style and I have a fear I’ll be trapped in the house and if I have a medical emergency no ambulance will be able to come and/or my car won’t be able to get out because we’re snowed in with low visibility.
🥲 
Anyone else have storm-fear like that? For me it’s just snow though as rain can’t really “trap” you. Also hate losing power which happens sometimes. It’s sad because just a few years ago I wouldn’t stress like this over a storm, I use to like waking up to an ungodly amount of snow. Anxiety sucks"
926,Anxiety,I feel like I'm going to do amazing things. But no one will remember me...,"I'm only 25 and I've already done some positively crazy things. I graduated highschool early with a 4.0, despite brain damage, memory loss, and a half year of school missed because of medical reasons. I'm the first person in my family to go towards a college degree. Even more, I'm going towards two Bachelors and then I'll be going towards my masters. And eventually my doctorate. I don't come from a rich family but I've been able to do some wonderful, usually expensive adventures. I mean, college itself is expensive. But with that, I've also done research and studied abroad in South America, in the middle of the rainforest! I've got my diving certificate and studied abroad again on the island nation of Fiji where we did both land and sea research while we dove. Also, I'm not just going to a university. No. I'm going to the university I chose. My dream university! And I am set for another study abroad experience. This time in Africa, spending several months in the nation's of Kenya and Tanzania! Where we will not only be going to school, but doing research and wildlife studies like I did in South America and Fiji!
Along with this, I am also working towards my sports pilot license. I mean, I've had my driver's license since I was 17 (a year later than intended because of my illness in highschool), I have my PADI Scuba certificate and am working to advance with that too, I have my motorcycle license, and soon my pilot license too! And along with my personal successes, I took my family on an adventure for all of us this last year, to a place we've all wanted to visit, and not only that, payed for and took my Dad and little Sis skydiving where we visited! Something else we all fantasized about for the longest time! I'm also an author. And while my spelling and grammar still need practice, I am working towards becoming a published creative author. I write descriptive works, poetry, documentary journalism, and absolutely love it! I am a scientist and an artist!

I have plenty of other great goals I am working towards and have confidence in. Beyond school I will continue to literally travel the world! I will succeed. But...

I feel, although I am and will continue to be a world traveler, a student, a teacher, a scientist, an artist, an adventuror, doing things others dream of, I will never be seen for this.

I don't think I'll ever be seen at all.

I am proud of myself, and I do not desire fame for any of my actions. But recognition.

I am proud of myself, but I don't think anyone else is or ever will be.

I mean, I'm a very friendly person, always happy to help and share kindness with others, but I can never seem to make a friend. Not even a social connection! I do not interest others.

Not only friends and family do I have issues making but relationships too.

I've been single for 4 years with barely a flirt from the opposite sex.

I don't think I'm ugly. I do think I'm a healthily handsome young man (not crazy sexy, haha! But still. I'm not ugly!). I've even hopped on a few dating Apps with almost no luck. With no actual conversations yet to come! And on my profiles I have pictures of me around the world, doing some great things. Scuba diving, skydiving, trecking through the rainforests, traveling!

And with no luck so far it seems.

I am invisible. Weather I desire to connect with family, make friends, start a relationship, or even just a kind conversation, I cannot it seems.

I am invisible to all.

And no matter what I have done, am doing, or will do, I expect to stay invisible...

I'm lonely..."

I have a seizure disorder which has always been pretty well managed but the last 6 months it flared up and I had one while driving and it was a bad experience for me. I have cptsd and severe anxiety however driving was always kind of a relaxing escape for me. I haven’t driven in 4 months and I hate it.

929,Anxiety,Overcoming Anxiety without Medication?,"Been extremely anxious for years. I think my worst issue is being a hypochondriac, which has let to legitimate physical symptoms that are not fun to deal with. Does anyone have any general advice on taking on anxiety without therapy or medication?

My only experience with taking medication was taking Zoloft a few years ago, just for a few days. It made me feel better, however I despise the idea that I need to take medication to function as a normal human being.

Couldn’t breathe (gasping for air), body went numb, eventually was paralyzed. Truly thought I was dying. Felt like my soul was getting sucked into a black hole. Was praying to God to not let me die. Probably the most scary thing that happened. Also could literally feel and hear my heart beat (192 BpM). In addition it felt like a 20 minute never ending dropping roller coaster. After the attack my body felt stress for 7 months, I couldn’t even work. I had another 1 but not to the degree. Pretty damn scary."
931,Anxiety,It sucks that my life can’t be put on pause,"I’ve been battling the same thoughts and crippling fears in my head for over 8 months and I still cannot wrap my head around the fact that I’ve been fighting the same battle for this long. 

When I’m in school I look around and people are just living their life like everything is normal. I have not felt the same since before my episode. I feel like I’m grieving the person I used to be every single day while life goes on for other people."
932,Anxiety,Am I the only one,"Hey guys! Do you guys ever get anxiety, but no amount of advice seems helpful because that’s not the advice you wanted? I feel like I get reassurance from people but I always end up having anxiety afterwards. Nothing seems to help. It’s kind of difficult to describe."
933,Anxiety,Worried about increasing medication,"Hi guys! I’m(23f) not sure if I’m allowed to ask about this (I know no one on here can offer me medical advice) but I’m just looking for maybe some personal experiences. I started having severe anxiety when I was 16, i couldn’t leave the house and had to do all my schooling online for 6 months. I started Celexa very slowly and once I got to 20 mg daily I felt better! I was able to do so many things! However I never completely healed and still struggled with things- just to a lesser extent. The 20 mg just took the edge off, I did have some uncomfortable side effects when I started, but they passed. I am now 23, and for the last year or so my anxiety has been gaining traction, I’m struggling to do a lot of the basics again and depression is getting worse. My doctor has been encouraging me to increase my medicine from 20mg daily to 30mg. Again I will do this very slowly. A huge trigger for my panic attacks is taking medications, so I’m just so so terrified of raising my meds or changing them in anyway. But I also want to because I am struggling so much and in theory they should help. I worry about ruining the slight quality of life increase they have given me. Like if I go up on the doseage and it feels worse, will I be able to go back to 20 mg and be ok? Hoping I could have some insight to increasing meds and how that experience was for others that will hopefully encourage me to make the leap! Thanks(:"
934,Anxiety,I delete most of my posts and comments on reddit,"Because I hate knowing someone has seen and likely downvoted them. As a writer I have to come to terms with accepting criticism but man, I cant even handle posting on reddit without taking everything personally....!"
935,Anxiety,Heart Racing,"How many times roughly a day do you guys get periods of heart racing and out of breath. It's driving me insane. Going on just over 4 years now. I'm beyond sick of this condition. 

Nothing makes me anxious, I just get horrible symptoms daily after a panic attack in late 2017."
936,Anxiety,I hate living like this,"I don't know how much of this is my anxiety, how much of it is my OCD. Both play into each other and both are diagnosed.

My biggest fear is death. At the end of the day that's it, and uh...sucks, because can't really avoid that one forever, right? But the direct connection is that I'm deathly afraid of cancer and I can't go more than a few weeks without being terrified that I'm dying of something.

I'm on meds. They're clearly not working well. Things get worse if I try to mess with them. Right now, I can barely feel anything at all that isn't just anxiety. I can't escape it and every time I knock one fear down another one comes back up.

It's not fair that I have to live like this. It's not fair that I can't catch a break from my own mind. It's a hard thing to understand from an outside perspective - maybe that's why I've gone here. Ignoring it just turns me apathetic.

I don't know why I'm posting this. Maybe I'll just take it down or won't post it at all. But if you ARE seeing this...I don't really know what I want from this. Advice? Reassurance? Just someone who understands?

I don't know. I don't know."
937,Anxiety,I keep having irrational fears and i dont know why,"As of a few months ago, I suddenly became scared of getting on trains, with the fear that theyll crash (resulting in me trying to avoid then, taking bus when i can and having frequent nightmares of train crashes) and another is of an explosion or meteor striking, any noise of an airplane causing my body temperature to rise and i get really scared, also causing nightmares.  

Ive tried to think back and the only possible explanations I can imagine was that my ex had both a severe fear of trains and meteors striking, but id never had these fears before and i dont understand why they would begin at our breakup, or how i could ""learn"" them in that way"
938,Anxiety,overthinking and being obsessive about my things,"It’s 2 am right now and i feel really anxious i
don’t know why i keep thinking there’s something wrong with me mentally, like lately i’ve feeling very detached and everything feels like a blur i feel like i forget so many things and this causes me to think my brain is like deteriorating or something i’m only 16 but my memory is so bad and etc. This might be just the cause of long term anxiety but it’s making me anxious i can’t even sleep."
939,Anxiety,Keep thinking about death,I can't go a day without thinking of death. I'll get it in my head that if I don't do certain things my family will die. It's usually just that I have to hold my breath but sometimes it's other things. Have any of you overcame your fear of death?
940,Anxiety,When do you trust your gut?,"I’m starting a job Tuesday, parents think it will be good for me. I’m 23 and have been doing nothing with my life. I went to college but life isn’t easy. I almost dropped out of high school, had multiple failed starts at college. Suffered endless bullying at school. I rely on my parents for housing and  if I didn’t take the job I’m not sure they wouldn’t have kicked me out. I do nothing because the anxiety of getting hurt again and how I’ll manage is immense. What do I do? Parents aren’t bad people but this feels like it’s going to kill me."
941,Anxiety,Why is googling medical symptoms so scary?,"I have a very bad habit in that when  i have any mild or moderate medical issue i go straight to google then i see the first things that pop up are cancer, needing surgery and possibly death. I do not understand why google allows this knowing they give so many people anxiety when if i were to go to a doctor they would not do that."
942,Anxiety,Driving Anxiety,"I've had people honk their horns and flash their lights at me for every reason imaginable. Flat tire. Forgetting to turn my lights on at night. Not moving at a green light etc. 

I was never a great driver, but I've gotten considerably better now. However, every time I see someone flash their lights or honk their horn it makes me incredibly paranoid as I think I am doing something illegal or there is something wrong with my car.

It has now gotten worse as at night I feel like everyone is flashing their lights, almost like I'm hallucinating, and it's making me incredibly stressed. Does anyone have any tips?"
943,Anxiety,Anyone got some good news for me?,"Hey, 

So I'm totally not sitting at work almost crying because I have - again - lost almost all of my self confidence and self-worth for some reason. 

Could really use some cheering up. 
How's your day going so far?"

945,Anxiety,Unsettling pregnancy dreams,"This post talks about pregnancy loss which may be triggering to some people.

I recently found out I’m pregnant. I’m almost two months and have my first appointment next week. While this pregnancy comes as a surprise I am trying to be mindful of this forming life. The thought of the future is too overwhelming for my anxious mind so I try to take it day by day. I’m also trying to find a therapist.

Now to the dreams. I’m already a person who has vivid dreams but I’ve been reading while pregnant you can have some pretty vivid dreams. Well for the last two nights I’ve dreamt of having what I believe are miscarriages. Since I am still early in my pregnancy anything can happen. I keep telling myself I’m not being pessimistic by thinking worse case scenario, I’m being realistic. But these dreams are extremely vivid and unsettling. I know they tied to my anxiety. 

Like I said I am trying to be mindful of this new life and apart of that is trying to get a grasp on my anxiety. Aside from therapy, any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to ease my mind a bit would be greatly appreciated!"
946,Anxiety,Scared of failing school,"I haven't been to school since November, and this week I went back. I struggle with social anxiety and have no friends. As soon as I got back my teachers were giving me midterm on top of midterm, so much stuff. 

Today I just couldn't go I felt really sick this morning and my whole body was tired despite going to bed at 8pm. Around December I weighed 120 pounds but all of a sudden I started losing weight randomly. I weighed 114 yesterday and today I weigh 110, my body feels super light and I'm shaking lots.

 My mom was very mad at me and my brothers didn't get up to go to school either (they are in elementary) they kept saying 'why doesn't Myname have to go to school?!?' Then my mom replied with 'well you know what's going to happen to her? She's going to have to repeat the grade!"" 
I'm so scared. I don't want to repeat the year, I've worked so hard to get here. Before 2 years ago I was a straight A student 90%- 100% on every test, I was every teacher's favorite. I've been trying really hard, having lots of internal conflicts trying to convince myself to go to school, to do my work, and to love myself. 

When I was in french class yesterday the teacher turned on a short audio book we had to listen to and reply to questions on paper. I couldn't understand a single. Thing. The lady was talking so fast her french accent was so thick I couldn't answer any of the questions. I've been in french class for  over 10 years why couldn't I understand.

 I'm ruining everyone's life I know they all hate me. My teachers probably hate me because I never turn in my work I'm just a huge burden on them. My parents hate me,  I'm ruining my siblings future they aren't going to school because of me and I'm ruining my own future. I feel like I'm crazy, I've imagined my future self hating me and being broke because I couldn't do school properly. I disappointed my whole family and all of my teachers that have ever taught me, all of their hard work only for me to be a failure."
947,Anxiety,Advice for Working,"So I've had anxiety all my life. I just turned 22. I can't hold down a job for the life of me. I'll work somewhere for a few days, get overwhelmed, leave, try again. I worked at a GS Station for 3 days before I stopped show ok my up. Worked at Cumberland farms half a shift before I had a panic attack and left. Worked 1 day at Walmart, no call no showed there. Worked at Amazon a month, then left. Longest job I've had was UPS for 3 months. 
How do I get over this and actually work. I get so overwhelmed and worried while at work. I'm about to try Dunkin Donuts so... Any advice on working with really bad anxiety? Ty in advance."
948,Anxiety,Any tips on how to calm stomach when having anxiety.,"At times I feel really anxious.My heartbeat rises and I feel nauseous.The bigger problem is my stomach.It feels like I need to use the bathroom immediately.I really don't like this because it can happen at any time even out of the blue.This gets annoying because I had a presentation I was ready and pumped up for but I felt really sick and had to postpone it.

Do you guys have any tips on how I can calm down my stomach while being anxious?"
949,Anxiety,I messed up an email,"Hello,

I'm in a tough spot at work. I had a deadline Wednesday of work I was supposed to submit. I got two reminder emails. It was very important. I submitted it by the deadline and bcc'd myself. 

Today, I got an email saying that I am being formally reprimanded and should meet with HR to discuss potential dismissal for failure to complete tasks. I found out I bcc'd myself but forgot to send it to the team lead.  I forwarded it to the team lead and hope the time stamp shows I did get it in on time. This is an internal matter so as far as I can tell, business wasn't distupted. Is this a common mistake or am I just stupid?"

952,Anxiety,Not wanting to eat when sad,"Anyone else doesn’t want to eat when feeling sad? I’ve never had issues eating but when I get depressed or stressed I just don’t want to eat, even if I’m really really hungry and feel like my body needs the food. I just feel like I don’t deserve to eat and just starve myself, idk how to describe it. Is this normal?
I should also add that I’ve never been medically diagnosed with anxiety or depression or any mental health issue, so Idek if it’s related to that."
953,Anxiety,Am I overreacting for having university choice worries?,"I recently decided which university I'm going to, but now that I've finished my application and been accepted I'm kinda freaking out, almost seeking out negative things about the city and everything else and worrying if I made the right choice, despite being convinced of it previously. Is this a normal reaction? How do I stop myself from panicking?"
954,Anxiety,How to get over overthinking and rumination?,I can’t stop myself from ruminating and I can’t distract myself
955,Anxiety,mental health is at its lowest and idk what to do,"recently, i feel like my mental health has been deteriorating and idk what to do. the past few months weren’t that bad but ive had some bad moments that have eventually led up to now. it just feels like my mind is consumed by so much negativity and im having so much issues with a various things that i feel so overwhelmed.

i feel like my physical health is a big part of this. earlier in 2021 i had so much ambition to become healthy, and fit. fyi im a very skinny and underweight person so it was a pretty big goal for me. that was until i decided to “dirty bulk” as it felt hard for me to gain weight. even still, it did not last long and i probably wont do it again. it felt like i just kept giving myself excuses to not eat healthy. that happened until mid last year, when started my job and i stopped working out and dieting completely.

i would completely like to start getting into fitness again, but right now im deep in a hole of laziness and junk/fast food addiction and its harder to get out than it seems. i feel like it impacts my mental health tremendously. one big part is advice that ive heard, to eat what i enjoy if im going to do a bulk but i found it hard to enjoy many of the healthier options and my mind just went to junk food. i also feel like i dont drink enough water as i should.

another big part is my job which i just kinda mentioned. ever since i started (mid 2021), my lack of motivation started increasing as i was becoming more lazier because of my job. it felt very hard to accustom gym life into work life because i have full availability. something my therapist told me was to just go even if i felt lazy and essentially force myself to do things but it feels so hard. i requested for pto in a couple weeks so i would have a small break to try to adjust myself thankfully

one thing that’s affecting my mental health that i feel a bit more embarrassed to talk about is my romantic life. i tend to still maintain a few obsessions when it comes to relationships and its a trait i feel i need to let go of. it does not benefit me and i am afraid of becoming too obsessive. i also feel like my friend who dont get me wrong, i enjoy the company of, but he is kinda a bad influence on my view of relationships because ive never had any urgency to get a girlfriend. ive always felt like it’ll come along the way but he is the opposite, coming out of a relationship and having such an urgency and desperation to get back into one. somehow it feels like this tendency is latching onto me which i dont want to happen.

one last thing i should mention is sleep and gaming. sleep has always been a big issue for me and it is not getting any better. staying up late at night doesnt even feel fun anymore. i feel like this is why i wasnt able to really progress when i used to work out. now about my gaming, i feel like video games are the only thing that make me happy right now. i love video games but they are detrimental to my sleep since i stay up late playing them and i lose time during the day. i cant let go of video games but i need to fix my entire schedule. my internal clock is so messed up and i find it hard to sleep at a reasonable time

anyways i hope someone read this because i seriously need the help rn. i want to cry but its so hard. i was just trying to sleep but my head is just overwhelmed by all these thoughts. my head feels like such a dark place right now. i feel so hateful and pessimistic towards a lot of things which is not a pleasing feeling and it doesnt make things any better. any advice would be appreciated"
956,Anxiety,Will I be prescribed medication (if deemed appropriate) at my first GP appointment?,I have a GP appt for a GAD diagnosis today
957,Anxiety,Do I need to see another therapist?,"So a little background, I’ve had anxiety (OCD) and a panic disorder since I was 7. but diagnosed later on and I’m 18 now. my first panic attack was in second grade and I’ve had them consistently since. I’m a very “go go go” type of personality so I’ve tried my best to make sure my anxiety doesn’t hold me back and I know when it starts to get bad. It’s still really difficult because I’m constantly stressed out, I get panic attacks while shopping almost every time and I’m just exhausted from the stress. 

I started seeing a therapist in the fall for the first time ever, my parents never really did much for my anxiety. They knew I had it but would tell me to just get over it so I ended up developing my own coping strategies.

My therapist doesn’t seem to understand how bad it is because every time I tell her what is bothering me, I also tell her what I’ve done to overcome it (bringing a friend along, going for walks, reaching out for support etc) and she tells me I’m doing everything right. In fact she told me out of all her clients I understand myself the best and I’ve basically been teaching myself exposure therapy this whole time. This is cool to know, but in a way it bothers me because I feel like my anxiety is still really bad and I don’t think she understands that. Is therapy going to help me at all? Or am I already “good” lol. Maybe it’s just not working with this one? I’m not sure."
958,Anxiety,I don't know if it's my GAD or if I am actually dying from an illness I have :(,
959,Anxiety,Anxious that I might have covid,"So for some background I'm 17, I have asthma, and I was recently in the ER for a separate issue. Day before yesterday was when I went, I now today began feeling generally sick with a mild cough and odd feeling in my chest when I cough. Minor flu like body aches followed, making me worry about covid since it was said to be similar to the flu. I'm scared that suddenly while I'm sleeping or while I'm not it will sparraticaly become severely impacting my breathing, (even though right now it isn't at all). Right now I do not feel as though I need to see a doctor, nor do I want to bother my parents again about another medical thing.. my father is at risk too and since we live in a small place it's really hard to distance out of caution.. please help me."
960,Anxiety,"looking into therapy, confused about some things","i’m finally looking into therapy to deal with my issues better. however, i haven’t ever been diagnosed with anxiety or depression, but i can tell that there’s something major wrong with my mental health. do i need a diagnosis before i go see a therapist? or does the diagnosis come later? i’m super clueless as this is my very first time exploring therapy as an option. would really appreciate some insight."
961,Anxiety,I just had one of the worst panic attacks I’ve had in months…,"My body still feels like static TV and my face is all puckered up and my chest hurts so bad. I almost called 911 because I genuinely thought I was having a heart attack. I’ve not had a panic attack with severe physical side effects in sick a long time and I thought my meds were controlling my panic attacks better than I thought. I don’t know why I’m posting this I just still feel really…. “Off” I don’t know if something medically is happening to me though and I’m scared as fuck. Like fuck my I have panic attacks at least once a day and in a bad day I can have 5 or 6. Even taking 2.5mg of Ativan a day my anxiety is absolutely torture. I can’t work and I’ve missed so many therapy appointments that my therapist has discharged me “uncooperatively” even though I try to tell her what’s going on and she is always very understanding. I just got the letter in the mail yesterday and I feel like a total failure because my anxiety is keeping me from getting the help I really need. Fuck. My. Life. How do you guys do it? I don’t feel suicidal but I wish I could just disappear. Or just become invisible and live totally alone. My girlfriend is on the brink of breaking up with me because she doesn’t know how to help me and my friends all left me because of my bipolar disorder, OCD, and anxiety/panic disorder. It’s so hard right now and I just needed to get this out lmao."
962,Anxiety,Health anxiety and COVID-19 diagnosis.,"Health anxiety and COVID-19 diagnosis.

25yom, I was diagnosed 10 days ago with COVID (self test) and I’m assuming it’s Omicron since 99.9% of US cases are but anyway, my symptoms have began to resolve. Not as congested, cough is better and so on so forth. Now I’m dealing with chest pain that radiates into my back and underneath my left pectoral area. Even though my symptoms are improving I am freaking out that maybe I have pneumonia, a pulmonary embolism, a dissecting aorta and so on and so forth. Nothing seems to make the pain better or worse and it comes and goes whenever it wants to. I’m super worried about it even though my family which knows about my health anxiety has repeatedly reminded me that it is probably nothing and I’m getting better and that these things just take time. Idk what to do anymore. I feel like I’m going crazy and I’m low key scared to death."
963,Anxiety,Cavemen - Selfwritten poem about what I think might be Cavesyndrom,"Good day folks!  
I am a newbie to social anxiety and don't know how to deal with it. Right now I am working in a foreign country and basically have to spend most of the time in quarantine so my bad thoughts come back. In the past, I found the Lockdowns quite boring but really peaceful and after everything opened up again I was even tensed in the companion of friends. Moreover, last autumn my university didn't accept my bachelor thesis because of some error in their system and I had to fight with them for 3 months. That made my brain go completely bonkers. As I can't get professional help here I just wrote all my stuff down. Maybe some of you have similar experiences and can take something from this. Moreover, I can highly recommend this kind of cheap therapy.

Lyrics:  
Hey guys remember the interesting snack this Chinese in 2019 got  
And since then everybody on this planet is facing an invisible flood  
Containing never-ending waves forced mankind to separate and go back to its caves  
Now a medical miracle happened step out there is land in sight  
This time it really might be the final tide

Can’t handle so much freedom it makes me go insane  
 Spend 4 months in single room waiting for a verdict in pain  
 Now every look I get hurts like a stab  
 Only when I feel alone I am in my comfort zone  
 Cope it with more screentime, cover that as metime  
 Guess you can win in court and still lose trust in people and sadly yourself  
 Guess know I can choose between being bored or overwhelmed  
 Not really how you imagine the end of isolation  
 My lungs are fine still I feel like one of the plagues patients  
 Others are okay as long as they stay strangers  
 Was fine with the cafe at the corner, as long  they were just neighbors  
 Suddenly they call me best guest, invite me four a private breakfast  
 My heart rate I better dont measure  
 Since when do compliments mean pure pressure   
 You got sniped at by bureaucrats not in war trenches  
 They watch you rise a coffeecup no need to fall for trembles  
 A night later junkies try to rob my phone  
 I fight them off calmly coz I am just on my own  
 Spend my sleep imagining the horror  
 That was yesterday and might be tomorrow  
 Waking up thinking I must be too late  
 See messages from my boss and straight get afraid  
 Oh no lol it's just a well-done mate  
    
 Yogis say just stay in the moment and be aware  
 How if the body reacts faster than you can think just dont care  
 Tough when you used to be a dreamer whose mind is longer a safe space  
 And something inside tries to jump from one to the next worst case  
 A single doubt or sound makes your body quake in lightspeed  
 All serotonin vanishes and confidence plays hidenseek  
 The daily life unmutes – I just wanna contribute  
 The woman infront gets nude – Sees my look and gets confused  
 Aks her if her shape makes me feeling blues – Na your hot I just need 2 minutes to switch the mood  
 It takes time for my body to accept it deserves your boobs  
 Dining with la familia should make you feel cozy  
 I get tensed like Tony Soprano would make a bad Mafiosi  
 The only lad who gets my mind straight to ease  
 Is my I guess 2 years old niece  
 N That therapy dog I maybe saw for five days  
 She grew into a person I faded into video calls and games  
 I like that she can't cheat, well but she can’t even speak  
 Only when I'm tipsy I can judge my fear sober  
 Wonder if drinking is healthier than this hormone rollercoaster  
 My anxieties eat me alive  
 So desperate even fight them with boring exercise  
 Try to master meditation though it seems hopeless  
 Maybe coz try so hard it takes ages to make progress  
 Where is my fucking pay off this doesn't makes any sense  
 I know how to be funny make enough money  
 and have it easy to make friends  
 Panic parasite did you not see who you chose  
 I have the spirit of a sloth I am not your right host  
 Don’t like living healthy can’t waste this time   
 Though my back won’t agree I should be in my prime  
 I love mocking people but under this circumstance, it feels like a wrong number  
 You caged me into the body of Bambi but my brain works still like motherfucking thumper  
 

Oh no wait the 5 minutes passed  
The attack is over just forget what I said  
Now the hormones bounce back everything goes reverse  
and I feel like the craziest Mofo of the universe,  
 

Oh no wrong hope, now there is omicron you can stay a homo digitalis everything is fine"

965,Anxiety,Citalopram - Thoughts?,"Hey there, 

I'm currently going through somewhat of a tough time.  I feel anxious quite a lot of the time, wondering always the worst-case scenario, if someone would do something to me, and always seeking reassurance about things.  Also going through a tough time with a number of things in life which has all come at me at once which I do not want to go into detail about.

Anyways, I spoke to a doctor today (my GP sucks in my opinion, even the convo with the doctor today I got the vibe she didn't know much about citalopram), but she prescribed it to me. I was on it previously, but I can't remember the exact experience I had except it killed my sex drive.

I am now here a few years on, more anxious, more worried, and I am just curious as to your thoughts about Citalopram?  I see it can cause permanent sexual dysfunction?  She prescribed me 20mg to start with and I am nervous about starting it.  I would say my anxiety is really bad, but my mood is medium - I can still joke around and be okay.   I also take anti-histamines for sleep - which I do not want to be on. Would this help?  And that also reminds me, does citalopram cause memory problems/dementia?

Just wanted your thoughts and experiences on this?"

967,Anxiety,"Anxiety and ""not feeling present""","For the most part I managed to cope and overcome my health and social anxiety. The big problem that remains however is the inability to focus and be present in the moment. If I'm having a conversation, the stress is causing me to zone out. I'm able to talk but it feels like autopilot and I'm not really there in that moment. This creates grater suffering because I feel so distanced from my environment and myself. 

Anyone dealing with something similar ? How did you manage to overcome this ?"
968,Anxiety,scarring alopecia?,"okay, i already know this post is going to sound silly. i don’t have scarring alopecia, my mom does. and it happens to be causing both of us a ton of anxiety. she hasn’t lost a ton of hair yet, it’s just thinning near her part. it’s only noticeable if you look close. however, i can see that it’s causing her a ton of anxiety and insecurity and it makes me really really sad. i don’t want her to be bald. it’s also apparently irreversible, which is making me more nervous. she’s seeing a specialist for treatment, but i’m still worried it won’t get better."

My heart pounds in my chest, my ears get hot, sometimes I even hear ringing in my ears. I’ve always experienced some amount of anxiousness when talking in class, but lately it’s gotten so much worse. I really don’t know why this happens! I don’t remember it being this bad in undergrad, though those classes were in person. The shitty thing is that now a lot of my classes are graded largely on participation. 

Anyone else experienced this? How do you cope? Any advice?"
970,Anxiety,Can’t eat or drink,TLDR I have NEVER had anxiety issues but the past few days I haven’t been able to eat or drink without throwing up. I have an unrelated issue with my esophagus narrowing but I just got dilated so I know it’s not that. I genuinely don’t know what’s causing this could it be anxiety? Yesterday night it went away and I could eat but now it’s back why? Any anxiety sufferers see any similarities?
971,Anxiety,I think I’m afraid of the dark?,"I’ve been unable to sleep at night recently until closer to when it’s light out, and if I do try to sleep at night, I have to have a light on. This only developed in like the past couple of weeks. I thought my sleep schedule was just messed up from my holiday, but tonight I realized I am actually frightened to go to sleep in my room at night! I haven’t felt this way since I was a child! I also find myself fearing nightmares or dwelling on fear when I lie down.
Anyone have any tips on how to soothe sleep anxiety? I want to get back on a good schedule and not be nocturnal 😅"

973,Anxiety,Could anxiety cause dizzy spell,"Hey guys I'm 20 years old, 6,0 and weigh 205. Conditions I have are anxiety disorder. 

Okay so I was having a good time playing games but while doing it I started to feel dizzy but it went away. But after a while it hit me so strong I got really dizzy like my world was spinning and moving left and right. I went to go lie down I fell asleep after and hour and a half. Now I wake up in the middle of the night and still feel a bit dizzy but not as strong. I was about to have a panic attack but calmed myself down. 

Why is my dizzy spell lasting so long. Could it be anxiety? What could have caused this? I am lowkey freaking out because I still feel dizzy."
974,Anxiety,Cigarettes,"Hey ex-smokers, how much did quitting actually help your anxiety? I've been wanting to quit for a long time (I'm 31F been smoking since I was 17), but.. you know.. anxiety.. and addiction.  🤣

In addition, did your anxiety sky rocket during withdrawal? If so, how long did it take for you to level back out? I think I'm getting close to taking the plunge, but I want to be prepared."
975,Anxiety,failed an exam bc of anxiety,A few days ago I had an oral exam (business english - not my native language) for which I was well prepared but as soon as I started talking I just couldn’t form correct sentences and my mind went blank. It was my first oral exam in uni and I was terrified of failing since I’m usually great in English. My professor offered me to exercise a few times with them to get more comfortable and I’ll do that but… how can I prevent my mind going completely blank when I’m super anxious and afraid? I have another exam in a week.
976,Anxiety,Decaf tea,"Hi all.

I used to drink tea loads and loved the clear headedness I got after, but the caffeine would usually send my anxiety into overdrive.

977,Anxiety,Lost my spark,"Anyone else feel like they’ve lost that natural spark/warmth because of their anxiety. 

The sort of warmth that represents being present in the moment and just happy and relaxed.

978,Anxiety,What's the best way to stay informed besides the news?,"A common theme here for people, myself included, is that the news freaks us out. I try to avoid it and it does help but, if I start watching after a while it feels like I missed a lot and everything's worse than when I stopped watching. I get an instant panic attack and it takes a lot out of me to calm down. Any suggestions?"
979,Anxiety,Sensory overload,"Anyone feel like sensory overload contribute to their anxiety? I have three kids and the minute they wake me up in the morning it’s chaos. Between them yelling, loud tablet noises, tv shows, I feel like I’m losing it. I don’t know how to deal with this without taking all of those things away from them, which doesn’t seem fair."
980,Anxiety,Metoprolol succinate,"(29, f) (hypothyroidism and t2 diabetes) I have been having palpitations and rapid heartbeats. Earlier my doctor had prescribed me propranolol but I didn’t take them for the fear of my heartbeat going too low. I have stopped taking coffee and chocolate and started cardio, it has helped my palpitations a lot. But last 10 days my dad got covid and I had a horrible anxiety attack and my heartbeat is usually elevated these days. I keep imagining something will happen to my dad or me and it will be horrible. Today I got ecg and echo, both normal but my bp was 140/100 probably due to increased heartbeats. The doctor prescribed me metoprolol succinate but I have the same anxiety that it will really lower my heart rate, which remains around 75-85 when I am not anxious. What are your experiences with metoprolol? I will start taking it from tomorrow."
981,Anxiety,anxiety attacks at work because coworkers hate me,"So i recently started a part time job (waitressing) and im like the youngest there(?) since im still a student. And basically its the full timers job to take care of the part timers and make sure theyre doing their job properly. I think the full timers have something against me? They treat the other part timers with respect but when it comes to me, theyre all snappy and rude. Theres this one other part timer thats like super extroverted and friendly and whenever she talks to them, theyre ok with her slacking off and everything but they get pissed when i talk to the other part timers. Whenever i ask them questions, the full timers are like 'cant u use your eyes/brain' and i dont know what im doing wrong. I admit im a little scatterbrained and probably not as good at the job as the others. But ive only worked there for a week. Im super (overly) polite because my anxiety does not allow me to stand up for myself. What should i do. Im planning to work there for another two months or so but everytime i get back from work, im like sobbing. Today, a full timer even apologised to me saying she was in a bad mood but she treated the rest of the workers fine? What am i doing wrong? do i just have ashit personality? For the entire of today, i was on the edge of tears which is bad because i think some of the cusstomers could tell? which is very not good"

984,Anxiety,Anxiety,Hey guys! I read this blog about anxiety and it feels kinda relatable. Check it out and let's have a conversation where we each can share our similar experiences. Kind of a virtual help group if you guys are up for it
985,Anxiety,"I fked up my 3rd Year University Paper, feeling lost and dissociated with everything","It was supposed to be an easy paper, I prepared so hard for it. But a combination of events just fked me over. 

I really don't know what to do now, my parents paid so much to send me overseas for uni, it feels like now I can't even repay them back with decent results.

The least I could do is score a 1st Class Honours for my degree, but due to this fk up, it is putting this at risk. I am scared of the trials ahead of me, the huge amount of extra effort I need to put in to make up for the mistake. Especially the anxiety that will come with the pressure of compensating for this incident."
986,Anxiety,...I'm scared I'm losing my friends.,"I have these friends, we've been friend for 5 years at this point. We're a close knit group of people, and I really can't imagine my life without them. We've been through stuff together...

It's just whenever I confide in them about something... I get told I'm overthinking. If I apologize, I get told to stop. It's obvious they care ,,, but sometimes I feel like they're tired of me. Even though they told me to always speak about whats on my mind...It's gotten to the point that I'm scared they all have a seperate discord server without me...and that they're happier there. (We mostly speak through discord)

I've lost friends before because of how my brain works, overthinking everything they say to me... 

I'm really tired... I just need help ...I need advice. Should I give them space? Or talk to them...not confront them though, I probably won't even mention my discrod server theory..."
987,Anxiety,advice needed,"I feel like i’ve suffered from anxiety since i was in kindergarten. i can vividly remember having some sort of anxiety attacks and heart palpitations at 6 years old (very randomly) and thinking i was dying. I’ve been to therapy on and off my whole life but i can’t find someone i’m fully comfortable/connect with. for the past year or so I wake up at 4 am with intense anxiety and cannot go back to sleep. this anxiety stays with me all day and comes from the most simple thought. a thought as simple as “i need to take my brother to the mall tomorrow” will have me up all night &amp; feeling like i cant/don’t want to do anything. A couple months ago i finally built up the courage to tell my doctor and he basically told me that it’s all in my head and to do breathing exercises.
I would like to know how others deal with this on their own. 
Should I ask for a different primary doctor? Would another doctor be able to offer me more help?
I don’t know how I feel
about a therapist anymore considering it’s hard to find a good one in my area and my insurance only covers the most basic ones. 
Living like this is torture at this point. I don’t see my friends, stopped going to school, and have a hard time getting up to go to work in the mornings."
988,Anxiety,Heart Palpitations,"*not asking for medical advice* 

I’ve had anxiety since I was younger and as I’ve gotten older I’ve experienced heart palpitations off and on. Last year I went to see a cardiologist because my father died young of heart disease and I’m not in the best shape. I wore a monitor for palpitations for 48 hours and they found nothing. To clear my mind I had an EKG, Echo and CT scan.. all came back perfectly clear. But I have been having consistent heart palpitations (out of rhythm) for the past 3 days. I just started a new position and started my period so I’m not sure if that’s contributing. Anyone else get consistent heart palpitations randomly? Again not asking for medical advice, just wanting to hear similar situations. 

Thank you."

995,Anxiety,"Please Help, I Want Chikfila, But I'm too Anxious too Ask!","So I'm at work right now. I'm new here, working in IT with just my boss in our area. I'm very shy and have a hard time opening up to people. Usually on Fridays someone in the office makes a run to go get everyone lunch. They have asked me a few times before, but I have politely declined, because I have a gluten allergy.  Yesterday my boss said that today they were gonna do Chikfila. I love Chikfila, and grilled nuggets won't upset my stomach. My boss isn't here today, so it's just me in the IT room. I really want some nuggets, but I'm very anxious about asking the front desk lady if they're going to get Chikfila today. So far I haven't heard anyone mention it. Every time I leave my area to go ask somebody, they look super busy, so I go sit back down.lunch is in an hour and 45 minutes...what do I do? I know this sounds silly, but yeah."
996,Anxiety,Gained anxiety from a life event,"25 yr old here. I had some anxiety through middle/high school but since then, I gained more confidence and felt that my anxiety had pretty much gone away. For years, I've been doing great. But then in March of 2020, my work environment became very toxic where I was working around the clock, I couldn't eat because it'd just come back up, always shaking, no sleep, didn't feel valued, and constant butterflies in my stomach. I didn't feel listened to when I brought it up to my manager so I lived like this pretty much every day for two months. My mental health was the lowest that it's ever been in my life. My situation has changed since then and life definitely isn't as crazy, but I feel that anxiety has become a bigger part of my life now. 

I left the toxic job for a new job during the summer of last year and thought that would relieve my anxiety. This job is much better in terms of work/life balance and there's really nothing significant that should be giving me anxiety. But it's like every email I get, every meeting I have, every new task where I don't know 100% what to do gives me anxiety. It's definitely not as bad as when I was working in a toxic environment, but I know it's there... 

I just want to go back to how I felt before without the constant anxiety :/ anyone else go through something similar or have any tips?"
997,Anxiety,Having a panic feeling right as I’m about to sleep. As if my brain is afraid to fall asleep.,"I’m someone who has on and off suffered from derealization and depersonalization where I essentially just feel out of it suddenly or out of my
body. Sometimes sleep is what has helped me not feel that way when those bouts get bad.

About a week and a half ago I noticed j had these tired lines under my eyes I was self conscious about and thought it was due to sleep and ever since then I’ve had such terrible sleep. I know I need to sleep because of work, general life energy, and to not be so self conscious of these lines and suddenly I have these panics before I sleep. 

It’s like suddenly sleep is my energy. I’ve slept fine my whole life but now suddenly when I try to sleep my heart races right when I’m feeling myself actually fall asleep. As if my brain is like “oh there it is you’re about to sleep!” And I’ve made an anxiety about letting myself go to fall asleep.

I was going to try melatonin but I don’t want to have to rely on a sleep aid. I can’t for my life of me figure out why sleeping is so hard now and I’m so scared this will never go away"
998,Anxiety,Help with going to the Gym?,"Hi! I really enjoy exercising and have found ways to do it on my own but I am interested in weight lifting and doing sets at a gym. However Im really anxious just thinking about it because I don't really know what I'm doing in terms of getting set up and being sanitary (like wiping down equipment and other etiquette). A not exercise related gym anxiety is after I work out. Like how do I use the locker rooms? What do I need to bring with me in my gym bag so I can leave feeling fresh and not sweaty and gross post work out? What would a good gym bag look like and what things should I plan for in a trip to the gym?

I'm not looking for workout advice, more how to conduct yourself in a gym and how to respect other people in the space.

Thanks for any help! I have gone a few times, and feel good bc I was moving around but I definitely feel like I could get a lot more out of my money (since I'd be paying for a membership)"
999,Anxiety,Positive/Neutral Thoughts,"Hi all! 
I’ve been having a lot of trouble with negative and intrusive thoughts lately. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to produce positive or neutral thoughts??

So far I’ve been journaling all my thoughts, using Headspace to meditate, go on walks, and numbing my brain with tv/podcasts/games.

My thoughts right now are about horrible things happening to me or loved ones and unfortunately being around people i care about has been triggering anxiety or panic attacks.

My brain is tired, i just want to be able to live without all these disruptive thoughts and i want to enjoy being with the people i love again."

1002,Anxiety,Eye contact tip,"Here’s a useful tip I have found to assist with maintaining eye contact in social situations. Eye contact can be difficult especially if you suffer from anxiety. If you blur your vision whilst looking at someone’s eyes, then you can appear to be maintaining eye contact without having to look directly into someone’s eyes!"
1003,Anxiety,"New to this subreddit, but not to anxiety. Looking for some guidance","So just for clarification, I’m not asking for any ‘quick fix’ and I’ve already been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with an anxiety disorder; I don’t need a diagnosis. I just wanted to be upfront about those things because they are against the subs rules.

Back story:
I’ll try to keep this brief, leaving out a lot of the theatrics and explanations of how I felt.

Basically in 2019 I had a health scare that turned out to be nothing. It is the cause of my anxiety disorder. After that scare, which lasted several weeks, I found myself walking miles a day, eventually biking for hours a day. The only thing that stopped my anxiety was doing this. Luckily I had a job where I could basically just take all my phone calls while walking, so it never interfered with my work.

I had a routine; wake up at 8, go on a walk/bike ride until noon, get a salad to eat, wak/bike ride until 5-6pm, another salad or very calorie conscious meal (steamed chicken breast, unseasoned broccoli, etc.). I lost 50lb in 2 months, and actually felt really good.

After 4 months, I went on a family trip and it destroyed my schedule. I literally didn’t ever go back to it. I regained all of the weight, but the anxiety was mostly gone.

Fast forward a year to this month; the anxiety is back. The problem is, the thing I’m throwing myself into isn’t healthy anymore. I have to play video games. It’s the same schedule as my exercise last year, but it’s video games this year.

My questions are:

1. Is avoidance okay? If I want to do something to not think about my anxiety, is that okay? Or do I need to confront it each time it comes up?

2. Has anyone had luck with transitioning yourself from one avoidance technique to another? How can I move away from games and on to exercise again?

3. I’m new to discussing my anxiety. Any other thoughts are absolutely welcome."
1004,Anxiety,Any advice?,"Currently having an anxiety attack that has been building up since the start of the day. I barely show any physical symptoms other than a little shaking, dry mouth and slightly elevated breathing. However, my mind is racing and I can feel my heart pounding. I feel like I just want to collapse. Does anyone have any tips? (I’m a 17 year old female). Because this as been going on for the past few hours and I don’t know how to calm it down. I’ve noticed it has calmed me down a little writing about it here but I can tell it’s going to start up again after I post this. All help is appreciated :)"
1005,Anxiety,Am I crazy?,"Hi all, currently half away from extreme to manageable and just looking for some help. I have daily anxiety and it comes and goes in different forms. Done the tests with the doctors with the concerns of the physical things. I’ve been having this one spot in giving me a sore/tight feeling in my left armpit area and constantly in that area/same spot. Smoke weed pretty much daily working on quitting as I find it’s starting to hurt more than help now. I normally get my highest levels of anxiety at around 3-5pm so basically after work. I was doing alright today and took 3 hits at around 7:30pm and my spot where it’s been on and off completely went off and then freaked out. My question really is can you have random areas that are heighten when maybe a bad time with weed because anxiety? I use to have another spot on the bottom right but that has gone."
1006,Anxiety,Would it be worth it to see a therapist/get on anxiety medication just for health anxiety?,"
I live a pretty stress free life. However, I have MASSIVE anxiety for only one thing: health anxiety (hypochondriac)

I had a life threatening event a couple years ago (I choked on pork, almost died, then got the food stuck in my esophagus and needed surgery) and that life threatening experience made me realize I am a mortal person, and ever since then, I’ve had severe health anxiety.

I wash my hands multiple times per day. I call poison control at least once a month for random things (I thought I got glass cleaner in my eye last week. I actually didn’t)

I wake up almost every night in a panic checking my heart beat if I’m still alive. I am extremely afraid of bleach, laundry detergent, and cleaning supplies since if you injest them accidentally, you can die.


But I have no anxiety for ANYTHING else. None for work or social anxiety at all. 


Should I get on medication just for this?"
1007,Anxiety,Propranolol bad luck?,"Psychiatrist recommended it to be used when needed so I do. My heartbeat was like 113 for half an hour, so I took it and half an hour later felt better.
But after I stood up to walk from class and now I’m feeling light headed and it felt like my blood pressure went low all of a sudden, not to the point of fainting but I just felt that sudden need to.
When I went to the school nurse to check my blood pressure I got 107/69 and 102bpm.
Thought it was supposed to reduce heart rate? I still feel so weird… Is this normal?

First time taking it. 10mg pill."
1008,Anxiety,having diarrhea and abdominal pain and i’m afraid,i know i probably just have a stomach bug but i literally can’t help but feel like what if i’m dying. what if i have like e. coli and i can’t go to the doctor so i’ll never know. i’m in a lot of pain and i’m shaking and i can’t calm myself down :p. i’m mostly just ranting
1009,Anxiety,Anxiety Dream,"Over the last year my anxiety has just been getting worse and worse. Lately I’ve been having anxiety dreams and the last one I  had was kind of traumatizing. I’m in the shower and start having an anxiety attack. I lay down and just start balling my eyes. And get the most real and intense feeling of complete hopelessness. Like I will never be happy or fine, and I come to the conclusion that there really is no point of living if I have to suffer through this my whole life. I woke up after that but that’s honestly how I actually feel. I think it came out in my dream because in real life I have a wall up that I use to avoid confronting everything wrong with me. I’m going to seek help still, but if I can’t find relief then idk that I can continue on."
1010,Anxiety,How does an anxiety attack feel to you?,"I don't know if this is anxiety, but all of a sudden while doing some studying I feel really weird. I feel like I can't focus and think properly with a lot of brain fog. My typing gets weird and it requires a lot of focus to correctly write something. I just zone out and everything is really foggy. Feels like it's harder to have a conversation. 

I don't have any sweating, fast heart beating.

I'm my day I do have anxiety and I fidget a lot. I used to have panic attacks a lot when I was younger, but those were characterized by fast heart beat, sweating, feeling like I was going to die.. etc...

I still feel like these after about 40 minutes and I don't know why."
1011,Anxiety,Shy Bladder,"Hiya, just wondering if anyone else in this group has paruresis? I’m a girl suffering from paruresis and unfortunately most of the members of the paruresis thread are men. I would like to have a female pee buddy to practice with but can’t seem to find any other women interested, only a couple men. I hope this doesn’t seem ungrateful, I just don’t know how comfortable I am with the idea of peeing on the phone with men and the only way to get better from it is graduated exposure :’)"
1012,Anxiety,Sometimes I get what feels like mini heart attacks but not sure if it’s anxiety,"Today while at work, I took a deep breath and it felt like I was choking. I couldn’t breath for a few seconds then felt a little dizzy. It felt like I swallowed something and it was stuck in my throat. The choking feeling went away pretty quick but then came an overwhelming feeling, my heart started racing and my chest felt tight. I started taking short breaths and took a drink of water. I’ve felt this feeling before a few times and brought it up to my doctor once. She advised me to count when I breath and distract myself with objects in the room. I tried it but sometimes it doesn’t feel like enough. 

I usually get these when I’ve had a lot on my mind, and lately it has been my relationship. I try not to let things get to me but I feel like my body is fighting against me now. I never thought I could actually get this bad and I never thought anxiety could feel like this. I always felt like it’s something in your mind and you can always control it, but now idk what to think. I know I’ve had past trauma and maybe some depression, but I’ve put my past behind me and I’m trying to move forward. Should I seek more help? Or ask my doctor if she can prescribe me meds? I really prefer not to take meds."
1013,Anxiety,Burnt synthetic fibres,Am I overthinking? I did not have ironing board in my doorm so I used my bed as an ironing board. I didn't realize that the bed sheet was made of a synthetic fibre. The sheet was burnt and the burnt sheet made a nasty smell... doesn't seem like a good smell.... I ended up breathing in a lot of that nasty gas. I changed my bed sheet but parts of my bed is slightly browned and had light odour of the burnt sysnthetic fibre. Should I change the mattress? Would my bed become a health hazard 😓
1014,Anxiety,I know what triggered my fear of dying . This life is miserable.,"I am so overwhelmed. Feel like something is wrong with my body all the time I could literally feel like my body or eye twitch and think I’m gonna have a seizure or die . From ages 14-17 I attempted suicide and overdosed 9 times and had to be be in the icu . It was on pills each time , and I never blacked out i remember how I felt my first overdose. Which was also my worst one ☝️ it was a very uncomfortable feeling I couldn’t speak , I walked very funny things were very off . Now at 22 I’m scared to take pills , the hospital tried giving me Tylenol but didn’t open it in front of me so I was scared to take it . Thought they were gonna try to kill me . Also all of my overdoses was at night time and also my sexual abuse by my father from 10-13 so automatically as soon as it gets dark now I’m not ok . I feel the best in the mornings and I wish it was like that all day . My anxiety is so intense that I check my blood pressure at least 4 times a day or any time I’m having anxiety and get the thought of dying in my head . I also use an oximeter to make sure I’m breathing even tho I am . That one does comfort me at times tho but I got picked at by sum old friends about this and it hurt me . I wish I felt like them , I wish I was ok . It gets 10 times worse one week before my period . I get a check bc I can’t hold a job or even function. I end up in a mental hospital Atleast once every month!. I know I’m saying some personal things but I’m ok with that . . Anyway this is not where I expected to be at 22 I’m not happy and truly believe this will not change . I’ve been on every medicine . Someone mentioned dbt or some other kind of therapy I’m not sure might try but ughh I feel so alone . Like can anyone feel worse than this ? Because this is just bad . I’m in an episode currently so my paragraph is all over the place sorry . Someone just talk to me if u don’t mind ."

1016,Anxiety,new to this,"hi, so i just finished my first semester of college and kinda due to lack of belonging i started to develop a lot of anxiety all at once. and ever since then my minds just been racing with thoughts, my heads felt constantly heavy, and my breathing doesn’t feel as clear and kinda like my chest feels cloudy in a sense?? i can still perform daily tasks and live as normal, thankfully, but i’m scared of how bad my anxiety has gotten so quickly because these symptoms aren’t just for a couple hours a day, but it is CONSTANT. like i’ve had a CONSTANT headache for the past month.

i know anxiety in an of itself is not normal, but is this what anxiety feels like? is it constant?"

1020,Anxiety,Everything hits harder in the morning…,I try to fight my sleep when I’m having terrible anxiety because everything just feels 10x worse in the morning when I wake. I don’t really know how to cope with these feelings except to just sit through it. Crying really helps but I have a hard time doing that and I always have to force myself to cry. Nothing feels real and I feel as if im always on the edge. I have been feeling this way since I was a kid and I just want to wake up one day and not feel anymore pain. I have mixed feelings about going to therapy because I don’t see that it’s something that would work for me. I would like to hear what works for everyone. I know everyone’s different but I would just like to talk and hear out some suggestions
1021,Anxiety,Anxiety from reading too much “fail stories”,"I am currently in day 4 of my 7-day snowboarding trip. I have always had bad anxiety about getting off the lifts but this resort offers 3 gondolas. For the first time in several years, I am starting to enjoy snowboarding more and actually improving because I am not constantly worried about falling while getting off a lift. Anyway, I am actually looking forward to the next 3 days. But today I came across an Internet forum where people shared all sorts of horrible stories of ski accidents (hitting a tree; hit by someone going really fast; etc.) these thoughts really didn’t cross my mind up to this point and now I am so worried that something bad will happen to me or my family in the next 3 days…. Ewww frustrating and now I can’t sleep. Just ranting"
1022,Anxiety,Globus sensation,"Tonight was one of those nights where I completely thought I wasn’t able to breathe, and I know it’s all because of anxiety. I ended my isolation after covid and now my anxiety wanna come back and I don’t want it :( I’m scared! I’m so scared of not being able to be normal again, please I need someone to tell me everything is gonna be fine :(

I swear sometimes I feel like a little kid begging for someone to hug me! Begging for someone to just hold my hand, begging for someone to pat my back while I cry. I know for a fact I’ll be fine, and that anxiety is not gonna kill me. I been here before and I will make sure I get better, one step at a time. Right? 

Thank you for everyone reading this, and no, I’ve only had therapy where I talked to someone and it really helped me. Didn’t need medication because exercise helped me completely."

1024,Anxiety,Panic attack over food,"I had a panic attack today over something my mother said to me earlier. It was about my weight and all I could think about was that I should just give myself an eating disorder so that she'd stop making endless comments about it. When I lived with her she used to weigh me every day. It gives me nightmares. I don't feel like I measure up.

My partner enjoys letting me eat what I want and things that my parents didn't let me eat. I still feel anxious about taking large portions. If someone makes a comment about me taking a lot of food I usually throw up later or feel really sick.

I have long hair and I almost cut a huge chunk out in the middle of my panic attack. I was holding the scissors and everything."
1025,Anxiety,I'm only 20 but I can't shake off the feeling that I've already failed at living because I'm not settled and okay.,"All I think about is my future. And how my future just sounds like an unachievable dream. I am aware I just hit adulthood, but the feeling of uncertainty is anxiety-inducing. 


I still don't know what my career is. I still don't know how I'll move out of the country. I still don't have any genuine relationships with anyone. I still don't like myself. I don't like anything about me."
1026,Anxiety,Are intrusive thoughts a symptom of anxiety and are they bad? TW: Somewhat gruesome intrusive thoughts,"So, I think that these are intrusive thoughts? I'm not sure though, and I'm not sure if it's a symptom of anxiety and if it's bad.

Basically I get these really weird thoughts all the time. In class, while driving, traveling, falling asleep, or even just sitting at home watching TV. An example would be just recently I was on a flight back to my home after visiting my family across the country. There were flight delays and uncertainty if I'd get stuck for the night in some random city - but luckily everything worked out! On the last flight, though, as we landed, I just suddenly thought of the brakes on the airplane failing and just crashing into the airport and how horrible that would be. My mind started focusing on how horribly painful that would be and if I didn't immediately die how much screaming I would hear. It made my stomach flip and I felt sick after that, so I put my earbuds in and listened to my music to distract myself. 

But thats like... normal thoughts for me. I'll think of these horrible situations and it makes me feel sick to my stomach and then I feel like I'm a bad person for thinking these things. Is this bad? Is there something I can do to help it?

Thanks :)"
1027,Anxiety,Had a episode,"Had my first long anxiety attack in awhile.  About 2.5 hours long.  Started with me listening to music and while I had the music paused and was trying to find something to listen to I could feel my heart beat which triggers me immediately.  So I do the dumb thing and check my heart rate, and of course it's elevated which triggers me again. And so started my episode of muscle tension everywhere.  Random sharp pains In my chest which just cause more anxiety.  Back tensing up driving me insane and a tingling in my jaw and cheek. Then my neck tenses up.  So I try diaphragm breathing but sense I'm already in full blown tension I can barely feel myself breathing and start thinking I can't get any air, so I put one hand on my abdomen and the other on my chest and feel that it's the same movements.  I release I'm starting to hyperventilate so I slow it down.   The anxiety subsides a little bit and I can actually move and do stuff so I decide to take a cold shower that usually helps me.  It did brought my anxiety down a little but didn't help that much.   A hour passes by and I have moments where I feel better but still feel like im dying.  So I decide to take another shower but this time hot.  While I'm taking the shower I keep repeating.  You've had multiple ekgs that all game back great.  You've had chest x rays that were great.  You have multiple blood tests that came back great.  Finally my anxiety attack calms down.  I'm still anxious but at least I'm not in full blown panic mode.  I can feel my body still tensed up but it's nothing like it was a hour ago thank God.  Sorry for the rant everyone but I just have to get this out.  I'm gonna go lay in bed and hopefully fall asleep soon"

1029,Anxiety,"Getting weird symptoms, is it anxiety ?","I am a 20 year old getting these weird symptoms lately. Couple months ago I got this weird feeling on the left side of my chest, basically it felt heavy 24/7 and I could feel the pulse beat a lot harder than usual. Naturally I freaked out, basically I created these scenarios in my head and convinced myself that I had some serious health condition. I went to the doctors for it, got a blood test, urine test, x-ray, EKG and he said everything looked fine and I was perfectly healthy. Of course, this gave me the peace of mind I needed and 2 weeks later, the heavy feeling in my chest was gone. Fast track a couple weeks later, I started to get these hard pulses again (with no heavy chest feeling) and noticed it around my stomach area too. I also then developed this mild headache (2/10 to 3/10 pain?) that has been stuck with me ever since. Im going through everyday with this “off” feeling and I hate it. I am so scared of my life right now and I have thought of every single serious condition possible (Brain Tumour, abdominal aneurysm etc). Have any of you guys experienced anything like this? Is it anxiety? I’m sick of feeling like this everyday and I just want to feel normal again :("

1031,Anxiety,Should I be concerned? Heart attack or COVID/Anxiety,"
I am 18f with no known underlying health conditions. I’m also double vaxxed Pfizer with no booster yet. (i actually planned to get it this week but I felt sick so I cancelled it) I was exposed to COVID Saturday, 12/18 and started showing slight symptoms on Monday, 12/20. The symptoms were just a sore throat and slight congestion. Since then, I’ve had no fever or anything just Shortness of breath (not too bad. I can still do my everyday activities), dull chest pain, sneezing, sore throat from coughing and congestion. I still have my smell and kind of my taste. I imagine it’s the congestion that’s affecting that. 

I’m also allergic to my cat so I’m assuming that’s what’s making me sneeze but I’m not entirely sure. 

What I’m concerned about is the SOB and dull chest pain. I have GAD so I’ve been googling and now I’m convinced I’m having a heart attack or I have pneumonia lol. I think my body is mimicking symptoms as a result of my anxiety. I think this because I don’t remember feeling these symptoms until reading about the heart attack symptoms (i might have felt it i just genuinely do not recall). I suddenly started feeling pains in my arms and legs once I read about them. They hurt when resting if that means anything. I am also on the pill if that means anything too. My coughs haven’t really been productive. 

My diet isnt too good either. I don’t drink or smoke often, definitely less than monthly. Please help."
1032,Anxiety,28 yo male. I have very bad anxiety,"I am a 28 year old male and i have very bad anxiety. Since i was a kid i have had anxiety especially around people and leaving my house. When i was a kid i didnt leave my house much. I graduated high school in 2012 and started isolating myself for long periods. Anxiety has prevented me from doing so much in life. I also stay anxious alot and have other fears as well.

Years ago i was diagnosed with a anxiety disorder. I stopped going to the mental health clinic because i could not afford it. I am asking for advice on how to deal with my anxiety without meds or profession help. Also if someone else is dealing with anxiety."
1033,Anxiety,Please help me.,"So I don't actually know if this is anxiety or not but maybe you can help me. I choked on some bacon about a year ago, and ever since then I've had this sense of fear when I'm eating. I always make sure I've got a drink nearby when I'm eating and if it can be helped then I'll avoid eating alone.

That was working fine for me until recently. Now I get the feeling that there's stuff in my throat. It started with this feeling of dread that there was some food in my throat and that I might aspirate so I called a friend and he calmed me down a bit. Now it's gotten so bed that it's 7:00am where I am and I haven't slept yet because I keep compulsively swallowing saliva and thinking that it's going into my lungs instead of my stomach and every time I swallow I have to cough because I'm terrified ill drown in my own saliva. I can't stop thinking about it. All I want to do is sleep and I can't because of this panic and it's making me cry.

Please can someone else tell me they feel the same of have felt the same and that it gets better because I can't deal with it."
1034,Anxiety,Mild but constant intrusive thoughts,"Several months ago I had an event that happens constantly for everyone, but it stuck with me for a while. At first it was all I could think about no matter what I did and would dream about it. I hated the thought of it constantly and tried to drown it out all I could.
After a while I got really good at forgetting about it but no matter what, it would always be back for at least a few minutes every day. It's no longer a pain to think about, but it will make me feel nervous for a while after. I already know it's over and nothing can come back from it, but the same minor feelings keep coming back.
Though it's not severe, and I might even say so minor that just writing this seems like too much for what it is, how can I keep calm? Like I breathe a bit harder and feel a little heavier but I can still function completely fine with my body. Just my thoughts get really clouded for a few hours and I just feel out of it.


Does anyone know how to push the feeling away when I think about it or how to better handle it? Again, it's so minor that I probably shouldn't even be asking but it would just make everything better for me so why not right?


Sorry if I repeated myself or said jibberish. I'm having a hard time passing out so I wrote this hoping somebody knows some trick."

1038,Anxiety,Food sharing anxiety ?,"I can’t find anything on this online. In my past relationship, whenever sharing an appetizer or a meal I’d rush to eat exactly the same thing they did in fear that I wouldn’t get my fair share of the food. For example - if they had a mozzarella stick, I had to. if they had a dumpling, I had to, even if I still had the mozzarella stick still in my mouth. I would rush to eat because I felt like I wouldn’t get enough to eat or that they’d have more than me. I don’t know what this is called and what causes it, but i’ll rush to eat so that I don’t receive less than the other person. Can anyone help? Is this an eating disorder ?"
1039,Anxiety,I really can’t take it anymore,"trigger warning for mentally abusive relationship

this is gonna be a long rant. I made a throwaway account so no one I know could find me, because I don’t want to concern them or get them involved any further. I don’t know where else to turn so I’m here. 

I’m almost 19 years old and for most of my life I’ve suffered with a severe anxiety disorder. about 3 years ago I finally got a diagnosis, but really everyone kinda knew it was a thing. it had always been prevalent, I was always afraid of everything, nervous to try anything, just generally a nervous person. but I got that diagnosis through a therapy program that was somewhat connected to my school. ever since then, it’s only just given a name to what I feel. 

I was in a relationship for almost two years ending in the summer of 2019. she emotionally abused me and manipulated me into believing that I was pretty much never good enough. everything was my fault, I didn’t feel safe talking about things I’d like cause she’d either get mad at me for it or make fun of me because of it. she constantly made me believe I wasn’t good enough, and the thought of her breaking up with me was a looming threat for 10 months until she finally did. don’t get me wrong, I did make my fair share of mistakes, I wasn’t infallible, but she found that when I made a mistake I would do anything to correct it and do anything to make it right. so she abused that. she made me fear doing anything that wasn’t just following a kind of strict set of guidelines. I couldn’t express myself, I didn’t feel free to be me at all, and I just kept going because I didn’t want to break up with her to 1. hurt her, or 2. be out of a relationship. it took me almost two years to realize that that relationship traumatized me. 

since then and even during I have seen about 5 or 6 different therapists that I only saw once for each therapist. it kept not working for one reason or another, so I gave up in trying to see a therapist. I still really want to. I need to. 

last year I was given alprazolam for panic attacks because they became incredibly frequent. that didn’t do much. earlier this year I was given citalopram but it didn’t help much. they upped my dosage recently and it’s been helping a small amount I suppose, but not really much. 

the good news is I recently entered into another relationship, but quickly realized that trauma is still there. I’m stressed all the time that I’m doing something wrong or she’s not gonna like me for one reason or another, while also being stressed about things that in my mind I can’t even reason with myself as to why they stress me out. it’s gotten even worse lately, I feel like vomiting all the time and I’m sleeping so much to just get that respite away from the stress. I can’t function as a normal human anymore, nothing makes me happy. I don’t feel healed or helped ever. and now I’m stuck, and we’re all caught up to speed as to why I’m here today. 

I have plenty of supporters in my life, but it’s just not fair for me to share this burden with them. it’s day in and day out, so stressed I feel like I’m gonna vomit all the time, and not being able to be the kind of friend or partner I should be because of this. and the worst part is that nothing helps. I feel awful that I can’t share this with anyone because I want that help so bad, but it’s really really unfair to do that. no one should have to suffer through this, and when people tell me they still want to know when I’m stressed I can’t in my right mind tell them, it’s not fair to them, they don’t deserve to also have to feel this. I don’t wish this on anyone, this is the worse I’ve ever felt. I just want to feel some semblance of normal and I want to be a good partner for my girlfriend. frankly I love her and I don’t want her to be hurt ever, she’s made it clear that she wants me to tell her when I’m feeling bad or stressed because she knows of this past relationship and of my anxiety, but I just can’t reasonably tell her that I’m feeling bad when it’s every single day. it’s not fair to her, she doesn’t deserve that. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this, I don’t know where to turn."
1040,Anxiety,Scared of developing more,"I have no idea why but this entire day, ive been extremely extremely anxious. I was at one point worried that i was going to end up believing in a crazy theory and end up becoming a crazy conspiracy person or develop schizophrenia, even though i knew that i didn’t believe the theory. Then as I was watching a show, i wondered what people that have voices in their heads hear and then i started to worry about “what if i have voices in my head and dont know it?” And then my brain started to kind of try and make them up, which was severely anxiety inducing. For some reason, my brain KEEPS trying to do it and its making it so much scarier and even though i know it is just my brain doing it, i can tell i keep wanting to question myself about it. It kind of circles back to the “what if i develop schizophrenia” idea. Overall, its just been kind of hanging over my head and i kind of need some advice to just kind of get me off that idea because it’s bothering me wayy too much and i am so scared of it."

1042,Anxiety,What advice would you have for someone who has been struggling with severe depression and anxiety since the pandemic began in early 2020?,"So long story short, my life was just starting to take hold in 2019, i was in college, had friends, was dating for the first time really, and my life was JUST starting to open up. literally right at that exact moment that I'm starting to do well, this random once in a 100 year pandemic happens and my college has remote learning for 2 straight years. for 2 years i \*literally sat in complete isolation doing 10+ hours a day of homework and stressful exams, barely ever left the house besides to get fast food and alcohol, and drank and stared at a wall.\* My professors went HARDER on me with work than before the pandemic, and i begged them for a break but didn't get any mercy. Literally ""I understand how you're feeling, but there will be no exceptions."" My sleep suffered, i was basically sleep deprived for 2 years (still am). I feel like I now know what prison is like. So anyway, i just pushed through it as best I can, and graduated. Now I'm just at home trying to recover mentally from all this. Im a little better without this degree of stress, but i still have anxiety and depression pretty bad. I just want a normal life. This pandemic or whatever it's called literally ruined my life.

My grandparents are in assisted living care and so I am worried that they got Covid as well. Im not sure if they are getting tested or when they are but I'm having anxiety thinking about if they have Covid and if they did have Covid what if they passed away. I hate anxiety.

Now I’ll just look up articles about asteroids and if there’s any coming close to earth or anything. I don’t know why I think about this so much. I really wish I didn’t because it affects me so bad to the point where I’m throwing up because of all the anxiety that’s built up thinking about it. It ruins my day and I feel bad for my fiancé who has to deal with it. He always comforts me though, but because I’m like this a lot of the time I just feel so bad and I don’t know what to do anymore to get this stuff out of my head."
1045,Anxiety,TRYING TO LEAVE BUT CAN’T,"Hello Everyone,

Welcome to my first real post on this app. I have been on here a while and always looked at things but never actually had the balls to post something so here I go:

Okay so back story me (M23) and my girlfriend (F24)have been off and on for about 2-2.5 years. When we first started dating things were going amazing bc of the honeymoon phase or whatever. But I was genuinely super happy and excited to see her all the time. But then slowly things started changing as we grew out of it. And they definitely changed for the worse. Like she would always pick fights with me or say some pretty out of pocket things that would be rude and piss me off. Which would then cause us to get into extremely heated arguments. She would also get mad when I would share my opinion about something that she felt strongly about.

(Ex. She told me she wouldn’t get married without signing a prenup and got mad when I said she has nothing of value anyone would want to take)

As time passed we started hitting one roadblock after the other and itches relationship started getting extremely toxic. The biggest issue being our families religious differences. Her family being strict and devout Muslims and mine being semi devout Hindus. Her parents will never accept me for who I am and I know that even if my parents accept her my extended family will never. She always says she doesn’t care about her relationship with her family and that if I really cared about her I would stand up for her. (Doesn’t quite work like that in my household)

Knowing this we have still been together for about two years now and it’s coming to that point where I need to either break it off with her or make a decision that will break apart my family. The biggest issue is no matter what I decide, my anxiety level goes through the f**king roof every time and I end up back in the same place I started. This also explains the constant breaking up and going on breaks throughout our relationship.

Recently, today actually, she texted me that she wants to break up out of no where because I didn’t answer her phone while I was working. Just trying to reemphasize how toxic this relationship is but for some reason I can’t let her go. I just need some advice guys I really want to move on but the thought of her with someone else just elevates my anxiety to a new high. I know this isn’t a dating forum but I just need help on how to cope with my anxiety and also if anyone wants to offer relationship advice as well that would be great.

Thanks people of Reddit :/

1046,Anxiety,Kinda just a rant...,"Recently I cut off most of my friends. We all had substance abuse issues so it was necessary. I've been getting my feeling/emotions back the past few months of sobriety. I get this feeling in my chest of sadness or anxiety, and it is weirdly nostolgic. I remember feeling like this when I was a kid. I just remember getting mad at myself for feeling it. To this day when I get it, I never know why I feel this way. Just makes me want to cry.

1048,Anxiety,Patronising colleague + manager,"We handle production issues on our days off (the Xmas break just gone) and I had let my senior colleague know that I’ll be off for a few hours so won’t be able to handle any issues IF they do arise and sorted out cover with someone else wayyy before this. He didn’t take this well for some reason, got super pissed over message and called me uncommitted and basically made a big deal about it as if he was my manager!! Very patronising. I’m the type to take things to heart especially for my job cuz I want to do well and get promoted (long overdue for one I’ve been told by others). And to make things worse, my manager has itty bitty issues with me I.e. taking an hour here and there off to sort my anxiety / physical medical issues out. Which also stresses me out. 

Clocking on in 1hr and will have to face my senior colleague and my manager (senior has defo snitched to my manager about the above even tho nothing bad happened with our production issues and my other nicer colleague covered my few hours off).

1052,Anxiety,"Just started birth control, can’t stop worrying about the side effects","I was prescribed birth control because of some cysts in my ovaries, and I started taking it three days ago. I read somewhere that taking birth control can increase your risk of a blood clot, especially one that travels to the lungs. Ever since yesterday I’ve had a tight feeling in my chest and throat and it feels difficult to breath.

For context, I have a history of hypochondria related anxiety. I’m almost certain this is a panic attack, especially since it goes up and down depending on whether I’m thinking of it. And it feels like panic attacks I’ve had before.

but gosh, my brain is so good at convincing me that “this time it’s different”, and “this time I’m gonna die.” Plus, the symptoms of a blood clot in the lungs are said to feel like a panic attack!

1054,Anxiety,I feel like my anxiety has anxieties,"Pretty dumb title but hear me out.

A little backstory. I used to have really bad anxiety going outside a couple years ago. Then I went to therapy. My therapist tried all sorts of things on me, most of them didn't work, but somehow breathing excercises did. I made a lot of progress in a couple of months. My anxiety almost entirely disappeared, but I was still feeling the lingering nervousness pretty much constantly. It wasn't anxiety though.

Then March of this year I caught COVID, I had to be quarantined for a month. My breathing suffered from it, so did the breathing excercises. Every morning I woke up breathing heavily for half a year. Then my hair started falling out really quickly, which made me even more anxious about my health. One of the main symptoms I always feel when I'm anxious is massive pain in my stomach, this started to appear again after many years. Because of the lack of oxygen my mental and physical health started to get worse. 

 I realized that now I'm anxious BEFORE I'm having anxiety. I have trouble going outside, I'm in pain when I'm preparing myself to go and when I do, I almost always have to run to the nearest bathroom. Eating out is pretty much always off the table now. Even getting groceries fills me with anxiety most of the time. Not to mention going to job interviews or exams at my university.

But now I got to the point that I don't even need to go outside anymore to get anxious and stressed. The lingering feeling became worse, the stomach pains are now constant and I'm always nauseous . Even laying on my bed alone makes me feel like I'm in the most stressful situation ever. I have trouble sleeping alone, I always wake up in cold sweat. Because of this I'm always tired and depressed.

Sorry, just wanted to vent somewhere."

1056,Anxiety,Constant adrenaline in chest,"I've been doing research and haven't found exactly what I'm looking for, so I'm wondering if anyone else feels the way I do. Kind of like hearing really bad news, or waiting to hear bad news, but for days at a time. Like a sinking heart breaking feeling even though things in my life are pretty content. Lately it hasn't been that bad for me since I've been taking prozac and buspar, but tonight I'm getting some lingering feelings of dread and heartbreak and I'm not sure why. Does anyone get this for days at a time too or is this something physical I need to check out? 

I have absolutely nothing to be sad or anxious about, by the way."
1057,Anxiety,Constant sleepiness,I’ve been going through court the past year over my kids and I’ve been very depressed and anxious over it and it causes me to be very sleepy during the day and especially when I’m home from work it seems like all I want to ever do is sleep and I don’t feel like doing anything else I can’t even lay down and watch a movie without going to sleep. Anyone else experience this? when will it clear up and when will I start feeling like doing other things and enjoying life again? My court case should be cleared up in a month so I’m hoping that will fix it.
1058,Anxiety,Venus Retrograde,I recently dyed my hair during the venus retrograde and the people around me keeps on saying things like “why did i do it” and stuff. Now it’s giving me extreme anxiety. Thinking that i’m gonna get so much bad luck or something since my zodiac sign is affected. i don’t really believe in it but people around me do believe in it. i love the hair color but now all i feel is regret

I even have tingling sensation, and a little numbness in my foot fingers :( I’m so worry, but I barely can feel it while I’m busy and walking etc. I feel it mostly when I’m focused on that or lying in bed that’s the worst!

1061,Anxiety,"I found a fix, but I don't know for how long","I was prescribed ativan and I actually feel normal again for once. My OCD and anxiety isn't controlling my thoughts right now and I can just relax and be myself. This is actually incredible, I never thought I would feel this way again. The only problem is that I've heard you aren't supposed to be on Ativan for long periods of time, so am I just fucked again when I run out or that time is up? Is my only fix in years just a temporary one?"
1062,Anxiety,Anxiety Dream,"Over the last year my anxiety has just been getting worse and worse. Lately I’ve been having anxiety dreams and the last one I  had was kind of traumatizing. I’m in the shower and start having a panic attack. I lay down and just start balling my eyes out, And get the most real and intense feeling of complete hopelessness. Like I will never be happy or fine, and I come to the conclusion that there really is no point of living if I have to suffer through this my whole life. I woke up after that but that’s honestly how I actually feel. I think it came out in my dream because in real life I have a wall up that I use to avoid confronting everything wrong with me. I’m going to seek help still, but if I can’t find relief then idk that I can continue on."
1063,Anxiety,Baseline anxiety has skyrocketed over the last several months. Unable to sleep more than 4 hours a night...,"Hello hello-

I'm going through a a really rough phase of anxiety/insomnia right now and I'm losing my mind. I've been trying melatonin, L-theanine, magnesium, and even benadryl with no luck. I can't sleep through the night! For a while I was unable to fall asleep until around 4am. Now I'm falling asleep fine, but waking up after a couple of hours, which almost always means I can't fall back asleep. 

I rarely take my phone to bed, I put it in airplane mode across the room most nights. I have tried apps like Calm and Headspace and they don't really do much for me.

I just booked an appointment with a therapist, so hopefully I can work through some of this. But holy hell I am so sick of lying in bed for hours, every single night.

Do you all have any suggestions?"
1064,Anxiety,I want to quit my job in 6 months,"I've suffered from anxiety all my life . I am tired. I am so so tired.

I have a good job, and I'm considering resigning to get a job in retail, my thinking behind it is this -

I worked in both Sainsburys and Comet and I don't remember being anxious, you just got on with your job, the small talk isn't as much and its not necessary 

I've tried working in an office  in 5 different teams, and have always felt uncomfortable, most recently I left my job that I'd been in for 4 years - I was so unhappy and anxious for 5 years, i thought by forcing my self to stay I would adapt - I didn't by the end of it every day was torture. I'm in a new time and same thing is happening, I already feel anxious around several colleagues, who won't shut up. I've tried this for almost 10 years, it ain't working

I just want peace, I think working in retail will give it as I have no issues speaking to strangers its just with people I see often 

I thought give it 6 months and if im not happy find a job in retail, part time at the same time I'd be losing a good job but it's been 10 years of misery, my partner is really supportive and will support whatever I do"
1065,Anxiety,Weird “shifting” feeling in chest,"I don’t know if anyone has experienced this. 

Basically I had a really stressful period in October-November where I had really high panic and anxiety every day. I was anxious about a trip and eventually decided to cancel, and as soon as I did so, I settled down a lot. A lot of my panic symptoms have gone away and I feel more physically relaxed. But I’ve been suffering from the symptoms of the anxiety “come-down” for about a month since. 

The main new symptom is like this “shifting” feeling which makes me feel like something is moving in my chest. It lasts for like a second and comes on randomly, but more often when I’m relaxed. It feels a bit like when you first get panicked (heart skipping a beat) but a lot slower and not as startling. I feel fine otherwise and nothing hurts and my breathing is normal. It’s not uncomfortable in any way either, but just weird and a lot different to what I’m used to. 

&amp;#x200B;

I wondered if this was a symptom of my body adjusting to a lower stress mode. 

It’s almost like my body is trying to panic and pump adrenaline around but it’s forgotten that there isn’t as much there right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

Has anyone else experienced this? I’m getting it less often now (maybe notice it once a day rather than a few times) but I wanted to know if it’s a bad or a good thing. Do I need to just wait for everything to sort itself out on its own?"
1066,Anxiety,Constant chest tightness. When I'm at work I don't notice it. Does anyone feel this?,"Have it worse or lighter. But it is here everyday for 5 months. I have general amxiety.

1067,Anxiety,My Anxiety Quiz,"So I got inspired from a scene of a drama to come up with this. Personally I like visual, imaginative examples to reflect on things and helps me to reflect better. I want to add that I am just another person that suffers from anxiety and in no way of a professional so take it with a grain of salt.

 The purpose of this quiz to understand what thought process is causing you to feel anxious and generally reflect on your reaction towards to an anxiety cause. This is mostly targeted for generalized anxiety disorder. This quiz also has no answers, the answers you give to the questions are supposed to  help you understand something about yourself.

Imagine yourself as a kid. You are walking on a road with your parents and as you are walking you are aging. Now that you've reached to an age where you can make your own decisions, your parents leave you to a place with bars that reach to sky. Now nobody knows where this bar sequence goes to but on your way your parents tell you it's a journey you have to take by yourself to reach to a beautiful place and you have to go there. They leave you after you reach the first bar. It goes like this, some bars are short, some bars are long, some are dirty, some are cold, some are burningly hot, some are slippery as goes on, there are numerous issues that you will have to bear along the way. These bars are only in one line so it's not like you have an option to choose which bar you will climb. After you climb one bar there's this little waiting area that is filled with rewards like food, jewelry etc, things that you need. Sometimes you can't see any rewards sometimes the reward is seemingly bad. You can also see other kids started to climb the bars.

Now each bar represents a situation, an event, an action and the sequence of these lines make your life road, I want you to focus on situations where you struggle mostly. Each reward is a reward that you get from a situation, an event and an action. Sometimes it is an emotional lesson you learn sometimes it is a change of perspective, sometimes you get something bitter at the end so these are rewards that aren't seen but you earn after climbing the bar. And sometimes the rewards are material things that you earn. Before climbing the bar sometimes you can see these rewards and sometimes you can. Each issue with the bar represents a problem which we all go through throughout our life journey. Sometimes you fall because of these issues and hurt yourself and sometimes you easily go all the way up. You see your friend Billy from far climbing his own bar and he seems like he is doing well. When he falls he gets angry but keeps climbing anyways and he seems like he is looking forward to earn all the rewards. Sometimes he hurts himself but he isn't hesitant, he is determined to reach the end.

Now answer these questions. You can also come up with your own questions and ask yourself how do you feel about it.

How's the weather like?

What do you think of the destination?

Do you ever fear climbing a bar? If so what are your fear? Does it prevent you from climbing the bar altogether?

How long do you wait in the waiting area?

What do you think of Billy? Do you think he is having a harder or an easier time? If so do you think it affects you in anyway?

What do you think of the bars? Do you think it is targeting you for something?

What do you think of yourself while climbing these bars?

If you slip 3 times and fall 3 times on a long bar how will you react?

If you climb 3 bars in sequence and while climbing them each time something unexpected happens and you almost fall how do you react? 

Now answer these questions really imagining how would you react in such a situation. And after answering all of them review your answer and reflect how do you react to situations and how situations make you feel. Did it help you understand something about yourself? Let me know.

Note: English is not my first language so if I have mistakes in my writing I'm sorry about it."
1068,Anxiety,Do you fear dying?,
1069,Anxiety,Parents arguing,"So I know I’m 28 but I still live at home and I still worry when my parents argue.

They have always argued since I can remember. When they’re good they are the best duo! They have been through so much together and been together for 40+ years but when they argue…they argue. It’s draining.

My mum atm is going through a stage where she’s is extra angry at my dad for literally everything and more. My dad on the other hand is very sensitive.. too sensitive and my mum can be too harsh.

I don’t want them to argue but most importantly I wish I didn’t care so much. It reminds me of that horrible feeling when I was child and I feared that they’ll divorce. I don’t think they would but I still worry so much! 


Not sure if my mum is more angry atm as she had cancer few years ago and I feel like all her post cancer anger is coming out now.

They’re both such amazing parents… I feel so stupid for even moaning but I worry! Does anyone feel the same when their parents argue as an adult?"

1073,Anxiety,How do you feel your heart with anxiety,"Many people experience heart palpitations along with anxiety. Anxiety sets off the body's “fight or flight” response as part of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). When you feel uneasy about a situation, your ANS kicks in, increasing your heart rate.

With anxiety, we can **experience acute attacks or become stuck in** this response, which can lead to persistent heart palpitations.

I often feel small ""stings"" in my heart which cause me to feel scared af. I feel this is changing the person I am...does anyone feel like this?"
1074,Anxiety,Persistent shortness of breath.,"Hello. I’ve had shortness of breath for over four years now and I still don’t know for sure what could be causing it and Im having trouble getting anyone to take me seriously and at least look into it further,even for peace of mind at least. I’m just shrugged off it seems and I’ve become increasingly worried because it’s gotten worse the last few months. 
The only possible cause I’ve been told is anxiety which I do suffer from and have done since around 2014,but I refuse to believe shortness of breath caused by anxiety can be this severe and persistent? I used to suffer from frequent panic attacks in the past but this seems different,unless I’ve been stuck in a constant state of panic for these past 4 years if that’s even possible? and how they can shrug it off as such when the only testing I’ve had since this all started is a couple of ECGs and one chest X-ray which came back clear at the time.

The shortness of breath is pretty much an everyday thing and it comes and goes in waves throughout the day that last minutes to hours. 
When this is happening It feels like I’m suffocating to death and I’m just not getting the air I need so Im always taking deep breaths in like I’m hungry for it. 
It happens mainly at rest,exertion doesn’t really trigger it or make it any worse,although I live a pretty sedentary existence right now and have done for sometime because of my mental health so it’s only really light exertion I’m doing anyway.
I’m constantly having to sit up and lean forward to take breaths because it opens up my lungs abit more. My chest feels congested and heavy as if there’s a bowling ball wedged In it and the more I try and breath the heavier it gets, and the heavier my chest gets the worse the shortness of breath becomes. 
My heart rate is also up and down quite a lot when I’m having these waves of shortness of breath and I sometimes sweat and shake a little,like I would when having a panic attack but I’m not particularly anxious most of the time, in fact I’m pretty calm and I just sit with it. There have been a few times where it’s gotten bad enough and I’ve taken myself to the ER but after a quick ECG I’m sent on my way and told to follow up with my doc which I have done. 

Could this really be sob caused by anxiety? Is anyone else here experiencing the same thing? it really bothers me but as I said I’m just being shrugged off and it’s frustrating. Thanks!"

1076,Anxiety,"I gave an interview to the local news channel, what was I thinking?! I'm so embarrassed...","It's a small segment where they ask for people's opinions on stuff and then show it on the evening news. At the time I thought *cool, I'm going to put myself out there*. Yeah, not so cool now. I think I was slouching, didn't know where to look so kept glancing between the interviewer and camera, said the wrong things and used a lot of filler words like 'uhm' and 'well'. I hesitated even when they asked if I'm a student. *I know I'm a student why did I need to think about it before giving an answer!*

1077,Anxiety,My mother is the reason for my anxiety,"When i was young my mther always keeps saying that i have a responsibility for my family since I was the oldest among my siblings, so i need to finish my study and find a job,and thats what she keep reminding me every year or everyday, that i become anxious over my future, i became scared of my responsibility, and i didnt want to bear the responsibility that i know i cant take it, but I dont have any choice since they gave me a good life and its my turn to return the favor 

But i cant even do what i like, i cant even enjoy just like the other teenager because I was anxious over my future that i shut down my self from the society, i just go with the flow but the truth is Im not happy

I cant tell it to my parents, because i know that they would scold me, im fighting all alone, without any help

It feels like a chain the forbid me to fly,

1079,Anxiety,Father is retiring and I don't make enough money to stay alive,"Before anything, I have pretty severe anxiety which often times makes me physically sick. 

Exactly what the title said, my father is retiring in about 1.5 years and I don't make enough money to support myself. I'm 23 and have an associates in biology if that means anything.

I work full time at $16.90/hr and go to college part time.

I support myself, other than the high rent in our area.

I got this news because he asked me to help calm my mother down (they don't have a house built yet to live in once he retires and that will be on the property they own 4.5 hours away). She doesn't want to leave me/the area that we live in. However he was the breadwinner and we don't make enough money to cover rent in this area.

I think I'm going to have to drop out in order to be able to afford rent. But how can I do that when most rent in this area is more than I make a month? Even with roommates it would eat 1/2 of my paycheck. 

I can't stop thinking about it, my anxiety is making my physically sick again. I was supposed to go to the doctors but I don't know if I can afford that now. I have no skills that are worth a high pay, and honestly I'm not very good at anything other than being a reliable employee.

I'm panicking and I don't see a way out. Probably going to delete later but any advice or comments would be appreciated. Please be nice."

1082,Anxiety,Feeling sick out of nowhere,"Wondering if anyone else feels this way.
I'm at a point where my anxieties are very under control, id say I'm usually at a 7-9 out of 10. 

However suddenly I'll start having the feeling of fever, stomach pains and general discomfort. All seemingly out of nowhere, without having something noticable triggering it. This usually lasts one or several days and makes me believe I'm about to die, or at least starting to be sick.

It bothers me since I otherwise seem to feel quite decent and understand what my triggers are and what to avoid.
I am dealing with health related anxiety, not wanting to be sick in general and absolutely terrified of vomiting etc.. 

Currently on my 2 day of feeling not great and was wondering if anyone ever get the same feeling and can relate?
What do you do to feel better and do you know what may trigger it in the first place?"
1083,Anxiety,Extremely scared of COVID-19 spread and recent potential exposure at a testing site,"Because my anxiety would not let me calm down about a recent trip I made last Saturday, I decided to get a test done in my local testing site for Covid. When I get there, there’s not too many people, and everyone who was unmasked there (I live in a more conservative area) was given a mask. In order to get the results of a rapid test, the testing center allowed people to wait outside for their results, and only let 5 people in at a time.

There was a lady at the clinic who left the testing site as I came in; while I was filling out the forms, she came next to me to check her rapid test results and I glanced over for which it said positive. She quickly left but I was “exposed” to her and maybe others in that office. Worst part was that I didn’t even properly fill out my form so my test results won’t even come in.

I’m really angry at myself that I unnecessarily exposed myself to Covid while at this clinic. Right now I’m alone in my city because I have to work and all my connections are out of town; if I get Covid I could be starting the new year with it and I really don’t want to do that.

I hate that my anxiety induced me to get even more exposed to COVID when I’m already afraid of it. I’ve been in extreme panic since going to this testing center even though I was double masked there and it just sucks that my anxiety made it worse."
1084,Anxiety,Too afraid to face my social phobia,"Hi. I'm 24M. 

I've always had problems talking to people, let's say, ""without reasons"". If i ""need"" to talk, even with a stranger, there's no problems. I go to the gym and have started taking cooking class, and i really have issues. But when it's small, meaningless talk, my head becomes empty, i can't think of anything. Even halfway trhought conversation i struggle to find words. "" What do i even say ? How do i respond to that ?"". As i was a shy, akward kid, i don't have stories to share. I feel like as a result, I can't engage or connect with others. I've had a couple of friends in school, but i lost contact with them. 

I've always wanted to be more social, to go to events, to make friends. But most of my attemps ended up as failures.
When i tried to go to parties and bars when i was a student, i just had panicks attacks, and either frooze or left. When i tried to date, i only got rejected. 

Now, i don't talk to anyone besides my family. I have no ideas how to talk to strangers and the simple thought accelerates my heart rate. And now i don't know what to do anymore"

1087,Anxiety,I’m 22 and too anxious to ask my probably controlling parents if I can visit a friend 20 min away,"They don’t even let me leave the house without permission, they’ve got motion sensor cameras and they never say no usually but just make everything feel like an interrogation and huge effort for them.

I’ve been trying to work up the courage for 3 weeks now to ask if I can go to my friend but secretly my boyfriends house (as they don’t let me catch ubers unless it suits them or buses and I don’t drive). Feel sick everytime I try and before that I had two other friends who lived in the same suburb that I’ve never been able to visit.

Would gladly appreciate some advice on this"
1088,Anxiety,Just tested positive for Covid this morning and I’m freaking out,"Rationally I know I’m going to be okay. I’m 28, triple vaccinated, and relatively healthy. But my anxiety is off the freaking handle, I’m barely keeping it together.

After 2 years of not seeing family we decided to come visit and stay with my in-laws. On Christmas Eve we were exposed to Covid. I’ve been freaking out this entire time worried sick that I will be unwell away from home and trapped up here.

Yesterday my father-in-law tested positive and my mother-in-law has been feeling horrible. The plan was this morning we were going to test and if they were negative, drive back home. But I finally tested positive this morning.

My anxiety is through the fucking roof. This was exactly why I was afraid to travel and this was exactly my worse case scenario. I’m so scared."
1089,Anxiety,I'm scared of what I'll do if there is another lockdown.,"Like many, I was deeply depressed and anxious during the lockdowns. I was mistreated by my family. I felt trapped and isolated. I gained about 30-40 lbs. I nearly cut myself. I banged my head on a table repeatedly. 

My state issued mask mandates and since, my anxiety has skyrocketed. 

I am living alone now in an apartment since the last lockdowns, but my gf is across state lines. If there is a lockdown, I won't be allowed to see her. 

I am angry at the world. I came very close to hurting myself during the last lockdown and I'm scared that I'll be in the same situation again."

I just have had my mind going a mile a minute and really kicking up those waves of anxiety in a way in which my prescribed drugs (Adderal and Wellbutrin) haven't been completely able to control like they do most days. I really just need at least one day of just like total shut down/relaxed/no thoughts...borderline just apathy... to decompress, let my mind cool down a bit, etc. I am curious about what other people do in these cases.

If I focus really hard and can unclench my jaw but as soon as I break that focus my whole face is tense and I grind my teeth all night (with a guard) and all day and only can seem to catch it when my teeth slide hard enough to make noise. It seems like no matter how mindful I am of my muscles, I can't gain any like habitual or subconscious results. Does anyone else do this and how do you deal?

1093,Anxiety,Too much free time,"Does anyone get anxious when they have too much free time? Im a 19 year old college student who just had a super long break.

I am already thinking about the summer and what I need to do to fill up my time, but it scares me."
1094,Anxiety,"Had a 3 hour long panic attack last night, and I’m not doing well.","For the record, I was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder about 4 years ago, and it’s usually worse during winter.

Last night, I had a really bad panic attack that probably should’ve sent me to the ER. However, my parents would’ve gotten really mad at me if I went, so I decided to tough it out. I’ve never felt that awful before, and every single tip and trick I’ve used over the years couldn’t calm me down—even things that usually work without fail. I was an absolute wreck. I woke up after about 4 hours of sleep and I’m still feeling really anxious and my head hurts, and I don’t know what to do about it. Nobody in my family or any of my friends have anxiety or suffer from anxiety attacks, and I feel really alone and exhausted. I really just need some support right now, because I’m tired of feeling this way."
1095,Anxiety,Diazepam,"My doctor prescribed Diazepam for my anxiety and he said to take it only when I need it.  I am not against medication for anxiety but in my opinion, as long as I am able to handle it,  there is no need for me to take medicines. In fact,  I don't even take pain relivers or anything when I am sick as long as I can handle it,  I just sleep/rest then it will be gone the next day all because I am anxious of the possible side effects of medicines.  

Now, I brought some Diazepam just in case I badly needed it but I am scared to take it. Everytime, I want to take it,  I get so anxious about the side effects because I heard that it can be addictive. I have health anxiety and what I did is I googled the possible side effects of taking it and now I am more scared.  

DAE take Diazepam? What did you feel after taking it?  Did you have any side effects?"
1096,Anxiety,How do you stop stressing about disease and everything else?,"It's hard for me to stay in a good mood when you're worried about everything bad happening. You worry about diseases and random bad events. How do you cure this anxiety? Never sent a family member pass from rectal Cancer, it's been tough. He was a heavy drinker though."
1097,Anxiety,What is an Anxiety symptom that you were sure was a serious health condition?,"I suffered from burning sensation on the scalp, fast heart rate, blurry vision, dizziness, skin outbreaks, headaches, dry throat, heat waves, pins and needles ( which were the WORSE symptom of all), numbness, and even FEVERS!! All doctors reassured me that i was in great physical health and that these were all symptoms of anxiety, but i just refused to believe so."

I am lazy to brush my teeth, take my makeup off, take a shower, dry my hair, even dressing myself. I end up doing them but it takes me hours... I want it to stop so bad, I don't even know if this is anxiety, depression or if I really am just lazy.

I really need some advice. What helped you if you were in a similar position?"
1099,Anxiety,An idea..we’re living the dream life,"Chances are if you’re reading this, using your phone or a computer to check Reddit, even on this sub page…you’re living somebody’s dream life. 

Anyway, I thought it might be interesting to hear your irrational anxieties…for instance: I’m going on a three week trip to another country. I should be soo excited, and parts of me are, but other parts are so hard wired after years of anxiety, that can you believe I’ve actually spent the last few days with bouts of panic, sobbing, etc. worries about leaving my dogs with my folks, my depressed mom, missing Christmas. It’s not that these worries are entirely irrational—it’s just that if it wasn’t this it would be something else. I’m incredibly fortunate, generally speaking and especially with this fun trip.  

I’ll always find something to be overwhelmed and anxious by. I work to rewire my brain with meditation for two years now and have come so far, but the work will never be over."

1102,Anxiety,How to prevent gagging from anxiety?,"Whenever my anxiety flares up, I will start to gag and vomit. It's involuntary and cannot be controlled. How do I prevent myself from gagging?"
1103,Anxiety,How can I stop convincing myself that all my friends hate me,"For the first time in a while I have a large friend group and have a lot of people that I would consider “friends”, but for around a month or so I’ve been having massive anxiety about them not liking me.

When I look back on my interactions with these people I always feel like the pity invite or as if they’re just tolerating me. Even though people invite me to do things I always feel like I’m never anyone’s first choice and that while they’re nice they don’t really give a shit about me. I know that’s a shitty thing to think but I can’t help but feel as if all these people are just being nice to me out of pity since we can’t really kick people out of this friend group (if that makes sense). Sometimes I just try to tell myself that people wouldn’t ask to do things if they didn’t like having me around but also, I don’t really text these friends (we usually just talk whenever we end up meeting up) so I end up feeling very alone a lot of the time. 

Does anyone have any tips for dealing w this bc it’s fucking me up so badly and kind of ruining the way I interact with people too."

1105,Anxiety,How to tell my employer I want less hours,"Hi all. I(16) recently got a casual job at KFC. I don’t mind working there at all and the people there are really nice, however, I can’t help but get really anxious in the lead up to work, even though I know it’s not that bad. Because of this I constantly feel stressed and terrible. My school year is coming to an end, and my employer knows this, so they’ve put me on 5 shifts in a week for about 22 hours worth of work. Now that is wayyyyy too much for me to handle, as I’m going to be so stressed during that week and I can’t continue that amount of work for very long without having a breakdown. My question is how do I tell my employer that I want less hours. I don’t want to tell them about my anxiety, but i don’t exactly know what to tell them instead. I’m sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to be posting this on, I just felt it would be most relevant to my current situation. Thank you in advance!"
1106,Anxiety,Doctor prescribed me fuoxetine,"Over time, I’ve felt that this helps. It takes two months even to feel relief.

Anybody else have success with a better med?"
1107,Anxiety,Is It Normal To Feel This Way As An Adult?,"I’m not sure of how to word this but I’ll take a free throw, and give it a shot. If you can read this until the end, hopefully you’ll see where I’m coming from. 

Lately (I’d say the past year n a half, I’ve been in a constant start of anxiousness. 

I will wake up in the morning, and before my feet hit the floor, my brain is going 100 mph and my heart is beating fast. Most times throughout the day, my brain is constantly thinking of worst case scenarios and I’ll verbally have to tell it to “shut the fuck up”. 

When things are going good, it’s hard to live in the moment and enjoy it, because I’m always waiting for something bad to happen. I try to always think of best case scenarios, but worst case scenarios always take over and send my thoughts in a downward spiral. 

I currently don’t have a job; when I had a job, I was always anxious, and depressed, and now that I don’t work a job, I’m anxious and depressed. I’m really not career oriented, and really don’t like corporate environments either. I’ve never had a job that I found fulfilling. I would always be excited before getting hired, bust my ass to make a good living, then soon after get burned out and have nothing to show for it. I was always told that if you put in the work, and always do everything right, things will always work out, but seeing the world for what it is, showed me otherwise.


I’m not rich nor wealthy, and I’m still throwing things at the wall to see what sticks. I grew up in church, and was born into a Christian family, but I’m not religious anymore, and I don’t believe in God either. 
I use to be so happy and free when I was a kid, but since I moved out from my parents, and been on my own, I’ve just been in survival mode. The things I used to find joy and fulfillment in, I don’t enjoy them anymore. Some of the people I use to hang out and communicate with, I don’t hang out or communicate when them as much anymore. 

Reality has hit me this past year harder than any other year I think. Seeing the state of the world, all the crazy shit going on, seeing how humans all around seem to have no regard or compassion for human life, makes me want to be in a constant state of isolation. The news is constantly feeding fear based bullshit and social media doesn’t make anything better. 

Sometimes I can be the life of a party, but most times, I’ll get a drink and stand in a corner by myself and observe. Most of the times, I like being in the house and away from others. 

I currently don’t have any kids also. I use to want them when I was younger, but as I got older and matured, and saw the world for what it really was, I strayed away from wanting them. Now days, I’m always anxious, sometimes depressed and I think having a kid would send my life in a downward spiral. I can’t seem to hold my attention span for one thing long enough, to even consider having a child. 

When I’m working on a specific task, I’ll end up getting distracted by something else, and before long, my mind will be in 4 different places at once. It’s like I always have 20 tabs open in my brain and it’s exhausting. 

I’m not sure why this constant state of worry has hit me but I’ve never been this anxious in my life. I’ve tried meditation, but every time I’m done meditating, it hits me again, and I start from square one. Sometimes I stay up late to keep from going to sleep, cuz I know when I wake up, the cycle will start all over again in the morning. 

I know once I post this, and put my phone down, my anxious state of mind will come back. I know this was a lengthy vent, and I was all over the place, but this is just how I’ve been feeling lately."

1109,Anxiety,My claustrophobia is so bad! I think I'm going mad. Please help!!! =(,"As above. I suddenly developed claustrophobia for no reason 5-6 years ago and it's gotten progressively worse. 

These are the following that trigger my claustrophobia panic attacks.

&amp;#x200B;

1) Watching a movie and seeing a character getting tied up/bound or getting trapped in a very small area. I'd shut of the film immediately and I have to stand up right away and pace up and down to cool myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

2) When I'm feeling cold, I'd take my comforter and cover up my body, and suddenly it will trigger my claustrophobia response and again, I'd have to stand up suddenly to pace about to calm myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) Just IMAGINING myself trapped even when I'm in a relatively open space is enough to set off my claustrophobia alarm. Sometimes my anxiety is so bad I have to punch myself on the jaw (lightly of course) and yell. =(

&amp;#x200B;

4) I avoid sitting in cars because seat belts set off my anxiety/claustrophobia. I take buses or trains where wearing a seat belt isn't mandatory. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so scared. Is anyone else like me? I don't know why my condition is so bad. Is there a medication that can help me?"
1110,Anxiety,Help me reduce my stress...I am so upset,"I am pretty sure my boyfriend is going to propose this week. There have been many details that I found out that have convinced me he’s doing it Thursday or Friday so I am pretty confident in that. I would be shocked if it’s not honestly. I am super excited, though anxious at the same time. However, I am pretty sure my sister contacted my work to get me days off this weekend to celebrate and that is stressing me out majorly. I am having a major panic attack. 

I am a night nanny; I take care of newborns for a few months after birth, so I work with about 4 families per year. Though I’m not bound by HIPPAA or confidentiality laws, I take privacy very seriously. My sister found out the identity of the family I am working with through social media; they had mentioned that they had a night nanny who they loved in a private group. My sister asked if they were talking about me and I said yes. I shouldn’t have, I should have respected their privacy. But I was flattered. Anyway, they told me they wouldn’t need me this coming weekend because they were going away. Fine by me, everyone deserves a trip. But I’ve come to realize they aren’t actually going away because on their calendar, it says the baby has a doctors appointment on Saturday and their older child has a dance performance. I can’t think of any other reason they would lie to me; they are always asking me to fill in extra days. I am now convinced my sister contacted them through social media since she figured out who they are. I am so embarrassed and afraid they will think less of me. I’m already nervous about the engagement since I don’t like a lot of attention and this just set me over the edge....but I can’t bring it up to her without letting her know that I know the surprise. I take a lot of pride in what I do and this is just so not my style. I have no idea where to go from here or how to release my stress. I am so sad and embarrassed and I can’t stop panicking. I love my sister but she way overstepped. Please help me to feel better about this. Thanks in advance!"

1116,Anxiety,Anyone feel like their heart beats like out of their chest sometimes?,"Sometimes I feel like my heart pounds out of my chest. And sometimes I feel like I barely feel it. I’ve had many EKG’s done this year &amp; had appointment with cardiologist and they did a stress test &amp; heart ultrasound on me. All normal. Even when I had random episodes in the middle of the night when I woke up into a panic/anxiety and my heart raced up to 180 for a couple minutes. 

Even though I’ve had all those tests and etc I still get anxious/paranoid about heart stuff sometimes. Like tonight while laying in bed on my back against my pillow, I felt like I could feel my heartbeat in the pillow/back. I fell asleep for like 5 minutes &amp; woke back up a bit ago into kind of an anxiety state. Felt like my heart was racing a bit. So I started getting even more anxious which doesn’t help the situation so I took one of my anti anxiety pills a few minutes ago so I don’t go into full panic attack mode. It usually does the trick &amp; helps chill me out. 

But sometimes it’s like my heart goes slow and like I can barely feel it in my chest, I know that’s normal but I’m so used to my heart beating faster than usual that when it goes slower I freak out about that too lol. It’s a cycle. I have to get up at 5 a.m. to shower and go to work. It’s 10:25 at night now. Ugh hopefully I can chill out my anxiety with this anxiety pill &amp; get some sleep. 

I wish I didn’t have anxiety/health anxiety. &amp; focus on my body all the time. :/"
1117,Anxiety,Randomly fearing food allergies?,"Hey there, I (22) have had general anxiety for as long as i can remember. Started on citalopram a few months ago which has been great! I no longer have panic attacks literally every day.

However; I still get really freaked out when eating just about anything because I’m worried I have suddenly developed a severe allergy and will go into anaphylactic shock. 

Does anybody else experience this? Its actually super annoying. I will be out to dinner and panic for no reason even though I have never been allergic to anything let alone experienced anaphylaxis."

1119,Anxiety,Fear of driving is ruining my life,"I’m 24 without a drivers license. I had a traumatic thing happen while I was first learning how to drive at 17 which has caused me to never drive again. I was already scared of driving before that event, and then what happened kinda reaffirmed all of my fears. 

That being said, I’m a real adult now and not being able to drive is no longer very feasible for many reasons. I can get away with it, but it is just very impractical and makes life 10x harder. What sucks is that, while I am anxious I am also extremely stubborn and will resist facing my anxieties until I’m absolutely forced to. Since I can technically get away without driving, I can skate by without having to face my fears. 

If you’ve had driving anxiety, what has helped you? What has helped you face anxious situations in general? Obviously I can’t take medication while driving, but I would if I could HAHA"

1122,Anxiety,Anxiety over death,"I know a little about what other people have anxiety over but lately I’ve had such a huge amount of anxiety over death. And in my group therapy no one ever seems to mention it. I do not take medication yet but also thinking maybe I should try give it a try. I don’t like the idea because I always have the weird and rare side effects. 

I have a lot of stress from a relationship and work. But I have the worst anxiety about death of my loved ones, myself, and my pets. The second someone says they don’t feel good I start imagining what could happen. When my cat won’t eat, I suddenly imagine what progresses from that. In life I’m generally a fairly happy person. But this anxiety is so overwhelming. Not only am I triggered by the talking about/someone being sick, but sometimes, when I’m showering often, my mind wanders, and suddenly I’m watching/imagining a death of someone I love. I don’t understand why my brain does that to me and I hate it. My chest feels tight and I feel like I can’t breathe for a small matter of time. It’s just awful. 
I do have a therapist. And she’s helped me recognize and interrupt these thoughts and helped me try to destress but it doesn’t feel like enough. It still happens and I feel horrible too often. I can usually interrupt the thought and focus on something else but I don’t even want the thought to begin with. 

Anyone who knows how I feel, I’d love to hear I’m not alone. Anyone with advice I’m all ears. 

P.s. - I don’t normally drink or do any drugs. I did used to self medicate with THC and while it usually super helped the anxiety it super didn’t help my diet."

1124,Anxiety,anxiety is ruining my ability to have a normal life,"tw: brief mention of eating disorders, self harm, addiction

Growing up I (f21) had a string of different issues, ones which I feel tunneled my anxiety into comorbid disorders so I never aknowledged just how anxious I really was all the time. Eating disorders, self harm, depression, anger, addiction. There’s a lot of shame surrounding my mental health as I have parents who weren’t necessarily always the most understanding or sympathetic to how different I am than them (they ultimately love and support me, but my mom especially has never experienced long term mental health issues and has a hard time understanding or putting herself in my shoes unless I try to show her how). my life is pretty stagnant at the moment and has been since the pandemic started, but I’ve realized how I have spent my entire life trying to hide just how crippling living with my brain is. I’ve internalized how chaotic my mind is and wrapped it in so much shame that trying to improve terrifies me cause that would mean revealing just how mentally unstable I am. I even hide my true mental state from my therapist, who I’ve been seeing 10+ years and honestly has turned more into a “friend (I know that is not appropriate and I’m trying to find a way to leave).” So then it’s like, double anxiety because I think “have I been putting on a persona for everyone for an entire decade?” I can’t even begin to think of how much that has held me back. 

Every thought I have has a thought, there’s a neverending dialouge in my head about absolutely everything. I can’t go a second without having to think of something (usually something distressing). I tend to therapize myself too, on top of critiquing myself, and it leaves little to no room to figure out what I’m truly thinking and feeling. It makes it truly hard to have a relationship with anybody, friendships and relationships alike. I become obssesive and think my way out of ever letting somebody get close to me. I truly can’t tell if anything I think is true. For instance, I’ll get a crush and think about them and what they could be thinking until I get tired of thinking about them and end up getting really frustrated and sad. Then I question myself, like “do I even like them? am I just bored? how do I even know of I like the opposite gender? how do I even know if I like sex?” then I’ll remind myself that some of my feelings are definitely real, but then that spirals into “if you have to remind yourself what
you feel is real, then it really just sounds like you’re forcing yourself to feel them.” 

Luckily I have friends who are super understanding, but I do genuinely worry that I will never be able to date, find a partner, pick a career, maintain my own home (I’ve moved out-and back home-twice), save up money, or live any resemblance of a peaceful life if I keep being this way. I’m so afraid that I’m going to become a bedridden recluse and never find my stride. I’m convinced that I’m neurodivergent in some way, either ADHD or OCD (I am definitely highly sensitive), and I know what I need to do is find a good therapist and potentially get on meds. But it’s all so scary. I need help so bad but masking is so deeply engrained in me that it flips on like a switch. But I cannot handle the huge amounts of  emotions and distress that I experience on a daily basis. I’ve “cracked” twice in my life and I’m terrified that it’s just
going to keep happening every couple years unless I get some serious help. 

I guess any advice, or stories of how it’s gotten better for you, would be appreciated. I know I’m not alone, but I know we all know how lonely it can feel."
1125,Anxiety,Severe Anxiety about Accidentally Plagiarizing Something,"I've had bad anxiety for a long time, especially school related, and I just need to let this out.

I have a research assignment due to tomorrow, and I'm extremely anxious about accidentally plagiarizing from one of my sources, getting kicked out of school, the social repurcussions...

So I ran my paper through a couple different (free) plagiarism checkers. Some were more legitimate (Grammerly), while others were probably more sketchy (I can't remember the names, but there were a few from the ones I googled). They mostly came back fine, and I made some changes just in case.

Then I read how some plagiarism checkers appeartently upload papers they check, and then you get dinged for it or something, and now I'm having visions of that happening-

I don't want to get dinged for plagiarism. I think I'm fine, but what if I'm not?

It's past midnight here, and I should be in bad, but I can't stop being anxious about it. Part of me wants to turn in my paper now, other half me says I should wait for tomorrow when I'm less tired, but I'm not sure.

Please help."

1127,Anxiety,Advice,"Hey guys just looking for some advice really, hope someone can help! For almost a year I've been feeling extremely depressed, anxiety through the roof to the point I feel like throwing up to the point from when I wake up to when I take an anti-nausea tablet at night. Suicidal thoughts (no plans). The last couple months I have been experiencing vivid hallucinations and I'm not a drug user. 

I'm booked in to talk to my University's mental health nurse to try and get better. This is my 3rd time trying to seek help for mental health. The first time I was in high school and the GP i visited just said to go home and meditate and get off my phone. And 2nd time I visited a GP this year a few months after I've been feeling this way and he was more helpful but just gave me a referral to a hospital psych ward. 

I really think I would benefit from that but the thing is I don't have the time to be hospitalised for a few days as I'm a full time student and manage a retail store and I won't be able to put food on the table or pay my rent if I miss work. 

I just need advice on what to actually say to the nurse? Last time I tried to talk to the doctor I couldn't get any words out and I'm terrified. Do i make a list of my symptoms? I'm really scared that I won't be able to get any words out and I won't be able to receive the help I need"

1130,Anxiety,Can anxiety and stress effect your sleep when you aren’t even stressed or anxious at that time?,"I have been an anxious and stressed person for a very long time. I mainly suffer with health anxiety but i feel recently my sleep has been effected, hate sleeping in the dark because when i try go to sleep occasionally i get these little flashes, i don’t see them when i am awake just when my eye lids are closed. Random and weird thoughts that pop in my head, it’s like my brain is just making stuff up on the spot to think about. Also if my head hears or notices a sound it’ll put a thought or imagine to that when i am trying to rest. Also my eyes feel like they are moving 100 miles an hour when trying to rest them, they are physically moving but could be my eye lids. Also sometimes when i do wake up in the middle of the night i see weird shapes and lines in the dark for a few secs then it goes. I dunno but recently my sleep has been effected loads. My anxiety or stressed only gets triggered when i come across these just before bed i feel relaxed. Frustrating!. Anyone else like this."
1131,Anxiety,Question.,"Since being in college, I’ve had nights where I will randomly wake up, heart pounding, with severe nausea/stomach pains and sweats. After trying to take some deep breaths and calm myself down, I eventually have to go to the bathroom to throw up. After throwing up once (sometimes twice) I feel completely better and am able to go back to sleep immediately. 

There is one other occasion that this happens. In the past 6 months, I’ve had to wake up at 4 or 5 AM for flights to or from home. The second I wake up, I start getting hot flashes and severe nausea. As I was walking through the airport, I felt weak, buzzing like I wasn’t getting enough oxygen, and nauseous. Literally praying I wouldn’t faint in the line. I ended up throwing up on the plane, which sucked.

I have dealt with anxiety my whole life. I’ve come to the conclusion that the nausea/hot flashes/stomach feelings are caused from it, but have absolutely no clue how to fix this problem in my life. The throwing up part is super concerning to me, too. I just don’t know why it happens. 

As far as the waking up early symptoms, could this be some sort of travel anxiety? (If that’s a thing?) Not sure why it’ll randomly happen in the middle of the night, though."
1132,Anxiety,Climate Change Anxiety and More,"Hi, I have really bad anxiety about basically everything ever(I'm undiagnosed so I'm really sorry if this offends anyone). Anyhow, as if having anxiety about being trans, how I'm going to transition, debt, medical school, family problems, sleep, death, rock climbing, school, friends, snow, and a lot of other stuff, I also have been having massive anxiety attacks recently about climate change. I'm super worried about where I'm going to live and how life will be affected by it, and I feel like I will never find a safe haven where I can be rid of all the anxiety triggers that plague me. Does anyone feel the same way about climate change just adding to anxiety? I don't know.

P.S Oh and I'm also worried about the fact that I say I have anxiety but technically I haven't been diagnosed and I really think I need to see a therapist."

Then I get shortness of breath like everyday and that makes me think I'm dying lol. All this really sucks."

1137,Anxiety,How to Deal With Health Anxiety Related to HIV exposure.,"Hello everybody,

I would say I’m a major hypochondriac, around 2 months ago I had sex with a SW and the condom slipped. A few weeks later I got tested at the 4 week mark and negative for every STD panel, but I had symptoms of urethritis and started having naseua, loss of appetite, ect. I then tested a week later with another HIV antibody/antigen and PCR test and that came out negative. Then I did one at 6.5 weeks and one at 8 weeks. But I still have had urethritis and weird symptoms like naseua, fatigue, muscle aches. Currently, my body still feels weird. I’m worried I could have potentially infected someone else I also have sex with and it weighs heavily on me. My body has felt weird, and no doctor will clear me that I don’t have HIV until 3 months. I currently only have around 3 weeks left before I can finally take my 3 month test/


I have been googling way too many symptoms, I do it on a daily basis and keep freaking out. I keep breaking down and worrying I could have infected my partner. I don’t know how to manage this anxiety."
1138,Anxiety,I did it,"I usually post on Instagram, and for some reason I get many replies. I had over 50 messages from different people accumulated, it’s very hard for me to reply to messages, it gets even harder when it’s a compliment, but tonight it seems like anxiety decided to give me a break, and allowed me to reply to my friends/followers, and on top of that, I don’t feel pathetic nor am overthinking the way I replied."
1139,Anxiety,Could I have an anxiety disorder?,"My symptoms are that I don’t tend to feel relaxed, even when I do I still feel my heart have a slight ache or something off, like it’s not completely rested and is still a bit you fast. A personal BIG symptom is whenever I have anxiety, I slur or struggle to connect my brain to my words. So I say things out of order or say them wrong, and when I notice that, it makes me so much more anxious and feel like I’m failing at talking or I can’t speak correctly. I tend to have moments where I freak out, I believe I’m not good enough to do what I want and I blame myself, I fill myself then with self doubt and self disrespect. Idk what I’m feeling or what the solution is, but I don’t want such negative emotions or feeling for myself to overcome me like they have.
Ask me any questions on what I can do to fix this.

I’m not a professional, I’m basing this off of my girlfriend (who has the anxiety disorder) saying I MIGHT have it, but to not take her word for it."
1140,Anxiety,Why do heart attack symptoms and anxiety attack symptoms have to overlap?,"I can't help but think I'm having a heart attack every time I have a panic attack. All started because my left arm was starting to ""feel lite"" and then I just went donw hill. My arm has felt like that when I sleep but I'm narrowing it down to the pinched nerve in my neck. So I'm freaking out I start trembling and shaking, I started to stim and snap my fingers and tap my foot aggressively. I was laying in bed listening to Streetlight Manifesto and hoping my death would be quick. It littlery just came out of nowhere and made me freak out. I then did the ol look up heart attack symptoms and give yourself placebo."
1141,Anxiety,Abnormal stress release,So I know this may be silly to a lot of people… I have really beautiful long hair. It’s honestly the only thing that I really like about myself.

1142,Anxiety,Does anyone deal with dizziness/ felling of unbalance 24/7?,I been dealing with constant anxiety for about two years. I have gotten better but I have this lingering feeling of dizziness and unbalance that won’t budge. I went to an ENT and he told me after multiple tests that my dizziness is not coming from an inner ear problem. After that my mind became even more anxious cuz now I can’t blame my dizziness on vertigo. My hypochondriac self went from thinking it’s just vertigo to I have a brain tumor. Why else would I be dizzy even when I’m not anxious. I also deal with depersonalization and lately my vision has been feeling very funny. Like it feel like my peripheral vision has expanded and I noticed movement really easy. Kinda like looking through a fishbowl. Also kinda some tunnel vision. I have an MRI scheduled for the 7th and I am happy that I could possibly rule out the worst and finally believe that my dizziness is purely psychological but I won’t know until after I guess
1143,Anxiety,My day is off to a great start 🙃,"Was finally able to sleep at 3AM. Slept through my alarm and woke up 5AM. Hurried up and went to meet my ride to school but she'd left me as I was 3 minutes late and I couldnt tell her I'd be late as my social anxiety is sky-high. Going home again now to try and get more sleep in.

My day is off to a great start 🙃"
1144,Anxiety,Anxiety Applying For Work,"I'm not sure if there is someone out there that feels the same way as I do. I tend to get anxiety from applying to another job, and then self-sabotage thinking I cannot fit any role. Here's the thing, throughout my late teens all I have been doing for my job is work at schools. I was a mentor back in high school and worked for America Reads at my college. I wanted to become a teacher, therefore a lot of my focus was on getting jobs at a school. I graduated from college a few years back with a degree in English and my current job today is as a substitute teacher. I'm starting to change my mind about my job and I feel like I lack so many skills. Like retail and all those skills from that job, I don't have. When I'm looking for jobs, I feel like I'm severely underqualified. I found a few jobs I thought I could do, but I end up seld sabotaging thinking I'm just not good enough. It comes to a point that I get a mini panic attack from just looking at applications, and then I procrastinate in applying or avoiding it all together. Things like this are scary to me. I tried waitressing once before being a substitute, but the owners of that restaurant didn't enrich me with skills while working there. They basically decreased my self worth in working at another environment and lead me to depression and even more anxiety walking in to work. It's a whole other story, basically many people sort of quit around the same time I did at the restaurant. 

Back to the main point, I was wondering if someone out there sort of relate to this? I'm not seeking advice, but if people want to put their advice and share how to over come this, you're welcome to! I basically curious who can relate with me on this though."
1145,Anxiety,Do you guys ever experience vision problems?,Lately my anxiety has been high Bc of the holidays and I have had a couple panic attacks and Depersonalization episodes and I have noticed that my vision has felt very weird like my Field of View has increased. Distance feels distorted like I’m having tunnel vision or I’m seeing things from a fish eye lense. I feel like it’s making me dizzy cuz it’s fucking with my perception of the distance of things.
1146,Anxiety,Public speaking anxiety,"Trigger warning!

Hi guys, I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, however I need help with this.

I'm a grad student and I'll have to do a presentation on next week. The thing is that I'm extremely bad with public speaking. The professor of this class told us about this presentation with one week of anticipation. The topic is extremely complex and it is totally new for me, and he expects to be 1 hour long approximately. To make it worse, questions are expected to be answered during this presentation.

I have bad past experiences with public speaking. For example, in my undergrad I did an awful presentation of 20 minutes (and the topic was far easier) and to deal with all of this anxiety and stress, I self-harmed. It was horrible , I cut my legs, arm, and chest. The cuts were superficial but it hurt horrible. I was shaking and in pain during this presentation and at the end, I spent like an hour crying in the restroom. Also, it is common for me have panic attacks.

It's been like 2 years, and I'm currently in grad school. I have no diagnosis but I'm taking medication and going to a psychiatrist. I'm making progress step by step, for example last month I did a little presentation for a different class and I didn't feel that bad. It was far from perfect but definitely  better. However, this new challenge is on a different level, I'm not ready for something like that. I'm afraid of self-harming again or to have a terrible panic attack. I'm starting to feel uneasy and bad, and I don't know how to overcome this.

Do you think is a good idea to told my professor about my struggles? I mean, probably with less detail, just for him to not be that hard on me during my presentation. Do you have any advice?

Thank you, any advice is appreciated."

1148,Anxiety,Stressing myself out,"I'm stressing out about how I'm 25 and have never been to college and if I do go I'll graduate at 30 in a classroom surrounded by teenagers. I didn't go because my social anxiety was so bad I almost flunked out of HS. My skill set and work experience in my field I'd limited and makes me useless if I got let go from my company and I'd do no longer be able to support myself financially. 

Meanwhile I moved out on my own in August and have a PILE of my deceased father's electronics that I want to sort through and save on a hard drive so I don't have excess dvds/computers/laptops lying around. I told myself I'd do it before the end of the year but I can't manage to get myself to do it. It takes up space in my room and stresses me out.

I struggle with adult acne. My topical medication isn't working well anymore I'm afraid to take accutane. Because of this my self esteem is low and ruining any potential dates I want to go on. I always have to cancel because I look a wreck. I'm 25 and have NO dating experience whatsoever. I got invited to a bar and panicked because I've never been. The older I get the weirder I'm gonna be for being so inexperienced. 

I wanted to take therapy for my social anxiety but none of the virtual therapists seem to be getting back to me. 

My diet is terrible. I either eat like a pig or don't eat at all because I don't know what I want to eat. My body feels the weakest it's ever been. I want to go to the gym but I don't know what I'm doing and overthink everything. How many reps? Is my form right? What do I eat afterwards? Am I wasting my time? Getting a trainer is too expensive at the moment. Everything is just piling on me."
1149,Anxiety,Trouble recognizing anxious thoughts,"Hello friends!

I’ve always struggled with anxiety, but I feel that both school and the pandemic have made my anxiety worse than ever. When it comes to socializing, even with people I’ve known all my life, I feel as though I’ve forgotten how to speak- which is why I avoid speaking altogether.
Not only that, but I’ve been experiencing major brain fog which has been affecting my work performance. 

Given that I have distanced myself from loved ones and have been performing poorly at work, I no longer know whether my loved ones and co-workers genuinely have negative impressions of me. I  don’t know if my actions are as severe as I’m making them out to be, or if I am being overly anxious. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to recognize anxious thoughts in situations where it’s easy to justify them?"

1153,Anxiety,how to stop feeling anxious and embarrassed after opening up to someone?,"i was feeling super anxious one night and had a breakdown and met up with one of my friends who was really nice and comforted me, but i ended up (i feel like) over sharing about my family issues, me issues, and ranting about how i don’t like who i am, etc. 

now i can’t stop feeling anxious about it, and terrified about different things that i know don’t make sense but i still am paranoid about, like “oh what if we stop being friends later on and they tell everyone about my past and it’s the end for me” or “what if they’re judging me and think i’m a horrible person and they actually hate me now but are too scared to tell me” and just overall feeling  embarrassed and anxious when i see them sometimes? i really don’t think they would do that in the first place but i just end up getting super paranoid and find ways to protect myself 

i used to have a nasty habit of over sharing for (i admit) attention and care from other people, also because i was in high school and didn’t know how to process my feelings, but now i feel like i’ve done a complete 180 and now i don’t really open up at all or if i do it’s because i’m having a breakdown and end up overflowing because i can’t be alone in the moment. is there any way to help process this or just deal with my anxiety that comes from opening up to someone?"
1154,Anxiety,Currently roadtriping and worried about my health and blood clots and all kinds of shit,Currently on a road trip to move back home and I did some Google searches and now im extremely anxious and afraid that im gonna get deep vein thrombosis and die or something.

So far I've been sure that we make stops every 1.5-2hrs to stretch and move around for a bit I also did 30 mins of cardio at the hotel gym and im even elevating my legs right now.

Any suggestions on dealing with this? I'm tired as fuck all the time."
1156,Anxiety,"It’s always a good idea to get evaluated by a medical professional, even when non-medical therapists say you just have anxiety.","Disclaimer!!!!: If you have health anxiety, please be careful with how you interpret it. Please do not go obsessively googling your symptoms for hours upon hours. If you’ve been evaluated multiple times by multiple qualified doctors and they say you’re alright physically and have evidence to prove it, chances are it may be health anxiety. Yes, some doctors are dismissive assholes who fuel the paternalistic medical system (which disproportionately affects all women, women of color, impoverished women, and LGBTQ folks) and don’t do tests or don’t do the right tests and they dismiss your concerns as hysteria but you may have a real condition. If you have seen top doctors who do not support the fuckedupness of medicine and they tell you it’s probably anxiety, it is probably anxiety. Please please please do not let my post make you scared and possibly fuel health-related compulsions. If you feel worse, seek professional help.

!!! MAIN PART OF POST !!!

So for years I’ve felt chest tightness and sometimes pain when I’d stand for a while (so commonly in lines and in the shower). I would also literally feel like I’m dying and panicked when I exercised. This anxiety would get better or disappear when I’d lie down. I told my therapist about it and she told me it’s just anxiety. I said it felt different but she insisted it was anxiety and said anxiety can present itself in different ways. It started getting worse and more frequent and I started to get some more symptoms. I casually mentioned them to my school psychologist and she also insisted that my older and new symptoms were simply just anxiety because she specializes in anxiety.

Well, turns out, the “anxiety” I have been experiencing is just my heart freaking out and going from 66bpm to 120bpm when I stand. Cardiologist says orthostatic intolerance. Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome. Explains a lot of the bs I’ve been experiencing, especially the chest stuff or “anxiety.” Oh and the coping techniques given to me never helped in these situations and some actually made it worse (breathing techniques). It’s a physical illness that is not psychogenic. It’s not all in my head like some have said to me :)"
1157,Anxiety,Morning anxiety,I tend to experience a lot of stress and anxiety on a morning and often feel overwhelmed by the tasks I have to complete in the coming day. This makes me feel anxious and causes physical symptoms of anxiety that worsen if I try get out of bed and do things. Does anyone know of any techniques that make help reduce this and help me deal with it when it does happen
1158,Anxiety,[TW]. Apparently death anxiety decreases as we age.,"And I'm wondering why that is.

Many psychological research papers say that and even on r/AskOldPeople when this question comes up (which is alot). Most of them say that they don't fear death.  I wonder why. 

[Note I said most but not all]."
1159,Anxiety,Fear of death has led to not sleeping,"I was never afraid of death, I was so depressed I welcomed it! Now I have grown up and I fear death to the point I can't sleep. When I do drift of to sleep I wake up suddenly and have a panic attack that I have died and I can't get back to sleep. Which has resulted in 4 hours sleep this weekend. I'm so tired but so scared. I really want to go to my doctors for help but everytime in the past i just kept getting passed around and not actually helped. I'm a mess atm and just feel like a failure to my kids as I'm not strong atm"
1160,Anxiety,Chaos is giving me anxiety.,"I think I am too chaotic a person and that is easily reflected in my lifestyle. It was never this bad before but now I have started to format my laptop at least twice a month and I keep updating and downgrading it every time I do that. I keep shifting my bed in my TINY room for no reason at all. It's just that I cannot get used to the space and that annoys me. I can't make a single decision about anything without going through bouts of anxiety and these are such trivial issues that I am not even sure if this qualifies as a problem. Before meeting my friends, i cancel and un-cancel at least a thousand times and they even expect it now. In terms of my career/studies I am completely lost. Everything seems interesting and boring at the same time. I think I could get somewhere if I were to just start but it's impossible for me to just start as there is a lot of thinking that goes into it which \[always\] leads to nothing."
1161,Anxiety,Any advice after an argument?,"I had a really bad argument with my mum last night over some family issues and it’s caused a lot of tension between us.

Thanks :)"
1162,Anxiety,Hyperaware of my thoughts and fear of going insane?,"I've been fighting anxiety and depression for a while now, and I've been having different symptoms such as depersonalization, health anxiety and breathing ocd. However, today I developed a new one which is the worst of all the previous symptoms I've experienced. First off, I apologize if this doesn't make any sense to you, because I have next to no idea how to describe this. About a few weeks ago, I've developed a symptom where I am constantly aware of my thoughts and the state that my mind is in currently. For example, whenever I see or read something, my mind automatically focuses on the way that particular thing processes into my mind and how the mind in general works, which hasn't been bothering me much. However, this has gotten drastically worse since then. I now feel like there's an endless flow of information passing through my mind. I feel like my mind is too loud (I do not hear voices) and that if it doesn't turn off or if I don't stop it, it will overtake me. I'm afraid that I'll go insane at any passing second due to being conscious of my thoughts before my consciousness can even process it. EVERYTHING I see and do scares me to death now and gives me panic like anxiety. It's a horrible feeling. I can't sleep or do anything anymore and my mind is locked on it 24/7. I can't distract myself no matter what. I even tried meditation but no luck.

 Have anyone here experienced the same? If so, what has helped you overcome this?"
1163,Anxiety,Nothing much,"I just wanted to say that even though I feel like dying, i want to give myself credit for what I have done in the past two years.

I still grit my teeth, i still keep myself up at night, i still get palpitations and precordial catch, i still have to be alone half the time.  Things aren't great, they might get better or they might not, but I've worked hard.

Two years ago I was fully and completely dysfunctional.  Depressed, suicidal, relying on my family completely.  Inside in my room 22 hours a day, 7 days a week.  On the Internet probably 12 hours a day 7 days a week.  Showering only twice a week and sometimes not even washing.  It makes me sick to my stomach just thinking about it.  Struggling to simultaneously build up the will to live and discipline to work in order to apply for jobs, get interviews, in order to support myself, in order to... What?  Suddenly all my problems would be solved?

Well, during the two years of the pandemic, i eventually did work my way up from a short term part time job, to full time, to permanent, to a solid salaried job.  Went from low level in person work to higher level hybrid WFH work, went from no benefits to great benefits.  I have to admit that the sudden increase in demand for people to help with the preventative response to the pandemic did create a lot of job openings and i rode that wave.  I'm not sure what would have happened otherwise.  I had a plan that was growing in specificity for how I would throw in the towel during March of 2020.  But when the snowball started rolling, I decided I would try.  And it took a lot of terrible stomachahes, horribly exhausting mornings running on no sleep, absolute flop sweat heart pounding panic sessions gritting my way through intimidating interviews, new job trainings, new commutes, housing logistics, etc.  

But all in all, my situation has really changed in the last two years.  It hasn't all been good, I've made some bad decisions, lost some money, set myself back occasionally.  And it's not like all my problems are solved.  Far from it.  But the crucial lesson I'm internalizing is that I really can affect change upon my life.  No matter how dubious it feels beforehand, if I really throw myself at the goal, work smart and work hard, I actually can change what my life looks like. So even if I'm not in the ideal perfect place now, I should have proven that I have it within me to keep pounding away.  Even if there's a false summit ahead and the real high point is elsewhere in the distance, this climb hasn't been a waste.  I've shown myself what I can climb.  

Godspeed everyone"
1164,Anxiety,Terrified for my medical procedure on Thursday,"I am having a colonoscopy and at this point, I am more scared of waking up and hearing what they are going to tell me. My symptoms have been fueling my anxiety since late August, and it is just so nerve-wrecking to know that depending on what they find, my whole life can change this week. I am only 21, started school again last year, and finally enjoyed where my life was heading after being depressed for years. I have so many plans for the future, and to know that it can all change in the blink of an eye this week terrifies me. I know it is very unlikely to be cancer, but it is still a worry based off my symptoms. I have not been able to fully focus on anything ever since I started feeling this way. I know I have to be an adult, suck it up, and do this for myself. But gosh it is hard. I am proud of myself for being proactive, despite my fears of getting put to sleep and everything else that comes with the procedure. Has anybody on here with severe anxiety had a colonoscopy before?"

1170,Anxiety,I got gaslighted at work," 

I got gaslighted at work a couple of years ago. I still have suicidal thoughts I was fed a fantasy where my mind was flooded with so much dopamine that I was not aware of my surroundings. My former boss got away with sleeping with some of the girls and I was being pressured to sleep with some of the girls because that's the kind of culture and it felt like such an uncomfortable work environment I saw how that Department was able to psychologically manipulate people just by a mere thought but sadly, they got away with it. I have very little evidence of the gaslighting because I felt I could not move in that environment and people and staff used to such excitement and thrill of seeing other people hurt and seeing pain as a good thing where it turns you into psychotic behaviour because you absorb it. I am still struggling with it right now and I could not tell reality from fiction. My lawyers tell me there is no much I can do because there is very little evidence to back up my claims. I saw these people had links with criminal gangs and the police they used to get a real thrill of seeing other people getting hurt and suck the life out of you so they make themselves feel better and belittle you destroy your confidence and self esteem and become a co-dependent of other people.

I tried going through the Australian Human rights commission but that seems to be a slap on the wrist for them they still got away with it. I was given the illusion of freedom too where my confidence level was being controlled by a narcissism. Leadership seem to be nothing more than a scaring contest that's what it was and there was a high smoker rate and you could really feel toxicity in these people like the emotional baggage too and people being put through severe psychologically stress, trauma and intense fight or flight, or freeze responses to the point of no return I felt immobilised at my desk . Sadly, it has aged me quite a bit I have suicidal thoughts, cannot sleep properly, feel scared about my family how my life was being controlled psychologically. The Department had this thing called ""We Care"" but no one really cared in that Department and most of them have forgotten why they started in the first place and my life was being determined to their specifications and not to my own. What are my options? My brother who is a smart person says that I will lose if I take them to court. I am from Australia but it's hard to prove gaslighting and I saw them psychologically change people to their polar opposite where you cannot tell reality from fiction."

Now after our weird interaction I'm afraid he is going to hate me and tell people what a fucking awkward loser I am. I'm already paranoid that people at work hate me and can tell I'm an awkward loser. Wish I would stop proving my weirdness to people and just act normal. My coworkers think I'm weird.

1177,Anxiety,My friends asked if I’m autistic and it kind of hurt?,"For all of my childhood I had diagnosed selective mutism. I think I’ve overcome it. I just like to assume I have social anxiety or that I’m socially awkward 
Anyway not long ago I said something random, twice for the sake of being random/funny until my friends friend asks if I’m autistic or aspie.  That she totally sees it and I might have undiagnosed Aspergers. 


I said I was offended and they brushed it off with there’s nothing wrong with having it, two of them have little brothers and sisters with Autism.   I thought about saying I obly have anxiety but decided it wasn’t worth it.   Should I have told them?

They sounded like they were joking or serious at the same time. I mean these same people bring up autism all the time anyways, for example “he gives me autism vibes” about a guy that kept hitting on me at the clubs. “I think he has autism. Not being rude or anything but in general” bout this guy in our zoom class that wouldn’t turn off his camera. 
It’s been an hour now and it’s still on my mind.
I don’t know why this hurts. 

 I had been accused of being autistic back in highschool three times actually.  It made me cry at one point.  Or the time my female friend told me “when you talk there’s no emotion in your voice. Kind of like the Sheldon guy from Big Bang theory.  You should talk with more emotion/expression. Then guys will like you. Don’t change anything else, your perfect.”   To her she was trying to help me but I was genuinely offended, why can’t I sound like a monotone kardashion instead?!  

I’m twenty two now.     Anyways some days I get so awkward, anxious or quiet.  I tried to do a beauty therapy traineeship.   just lost a simple job for being too slow, repeating the same mistakes etc.  my boss didnt understand why I was the way I was and asked if there was anything about me she needed to know, and I didn’t tell her thinking it would effect my job. I ended up losing the job anyways.  Makes me self pity myself over my condition and being an adult and probably never being able to keep a job, giving me the i want to jump off a bridge thoughts I’ve had since finishing highscjool. But I could never do it. 

Anyways. Now that I’ve gone off topic, baxk to the main one.   I don’t know why but being accused of that hurt, just like it did in highschool.  I don’t like my friends mutual friend anyways, he’s full of dumb offensive jokes.   I try to not care what people think and have an idgaf attitude that I want to naturally have.  But no, it’s still on MY MIND.    

Just forget it huh?  I can be abit quiet,  abit odd, crazy, socially awkward, quirky. That’s all.

1178,Anxiety,So much work anxiety!,"so i started a new job at the start of October. I’ve had essentially nothing to do up until last week due to technical issues. Now i’m finally starting work, and going into the office (it was work from home for my
first few weeks) i’m so anxious. I was pretty anxious when i was working from home but now it’s so bad. i’m non-stop worried i’m under qualified/too stupid, i feel like my coworkers and managers hate me and or think i’m lazy/stupid, my social anxiety is through the roof 24/7 as i struggle to have enough energy to talk to people and do work (i’m a massive introvert). it’s a job in finance (something i have no qualifications/experience in but that is not necessary for my level of job). 

today, i was doing a process we have to do every morning. it was my first time doing it and i had to ask the person instructing me how to do it like 4 times. she already showed me once last week so i feel like this instructor fucking hates me now cause i keep having to ask her how to do stuff. 

i understand that part of this is imposter syndrome, i feel like an imposter 24/7 - whether in social life, relationships, music, art, anything. idk why but i just can’t fight. 

any help would be appreciated"

1181,Anxiety,Forgot to pay my restaurant tab,"Hi, 

So I ate at a restaurant by myself. Staff was really nice and I enjoyed their food. After eating, I cleaned my table (put everything together), stood up, walked towards the restaurant's exit, struggled to push open the door, only to be stopped by a staff and be told that I haven't paid my bill yet. 

Jesus, I have completely forgotten that I was at a restaurant, not a fast-food chain. The staff was nice and handed me the bill, and I apologized, paid it and even gave him a huge tip, because it was embarrassing. 

When I got home, I called them and said sorry. They were nice and told me it was okay. 

I could not stop thinking about this. It was humiliating. My brain is really tired of thinking about so many things. 😑 I feel like disappearing."

1183,Anxiety,chest pain,ive been having neck shoulder and chest   pain for 3 days but i can take a deep breath am worried
1184,Anxiety,Starting my new job today and I'm a mess,I'm starting my new job today and it's a great job and a real step up for me in every way. But I'm freaking out. I've not slept and I've been up having anxiety attacks all night. I'm throwing up and physically shaking. I don't know what to do. I can't go like this.
1185,Anxiety,Hiv scare,"I am female 21. Had my first sexual encounter a month and 1 week ago with a guy I went to the same high school as. I am paranoid that I might have HIV because. We had protective vaginal sex.
Which was very brief because I was too tight.  But  oral sex was unprotected and I swallowed some salty fluid I am assuming is precum.That's how I think I potentially contracted the virus
 He also spat on my vagina while going down on me. I am assuming I got bacteria or some sti/std from that. Also got a uti from that.
 a few days after the encounter my temperature was high, I had white stuff in the back of my throat and developed a few bumps on my vagina, experienced sweating and a different discharge not sure is it because of my virginity breaking.
What's very concerning is that I have been  experiencing very severe muscle ache in arms and legs numbness, stinging, tingling, pain, lack of blood flow in arms and legs.
Which I have never experienced before!
Because of this I am now convinced I have HIV. I am extremely scared.
At some point i thought it might be because of my vitamin deficiency but why now?
I have 6 weeks left before testing. But I am barely making it through. 
I am anxious in fear and this is running through my mind 24 7. I can barely fall asleep. I feel like I am on the verge of insanity. I can't help but Google something every single day.
I still talk to the him everyday but I don't know how to tell him about all of this.
Because I am assuming he might have HIV and doesn't know.
Which I don't even know.
So my is question is am I experiencing symptoms of HIV?😭😭
Or how likely is transmission from unprotected oral.
I just need some form of reassurance or advice."
1186,Anxiety,Is that anxiety?,"Couple of days ago I had the worst panic attack in my life, I was about to pass out and my heart beat per minute was at 187 at the most for solid 40 minutes. And I was trying to sit etc, but had it at 150-187 all the time. (I’m 18 years old). That day I tought I will die, I would say I was 95% sure I’m dying.

Had same problems in school with heart beat rate around 140 while sitting, happend couple days.

Most of the time I feel like I’m dreaming, and I forget stuff easily, and can’t focus. I really hope I can get some help because things are getting worse for me.

Right now I was making beats on my computer, and randomly I feelt weird with my heart and tought I’m going to pass out, I got really stressed, and my heart beat per minute was at around 90 so it was/is normal. 

Any suggestions what I can do? Or someone knows what is wrong with me?
Kindly don’t ignore, I would like to hear yall toughts."
1187,Anxiety,Suddenly very afraid of developing schizophrenia,"I’ve been having an extremely hard time sleeping tonight as I feel like I’ve suddenly been having really random thoughts tonight. This is hard to explain, but when trying to sleep I keep playing out random scenarios in my head involving other people, and then waking up to double check they’re not real. I’m now feeling very panicked and afraid and I feel like it’s making me feel more crazy. I’m now terrified that my fear and stress will bring on schizophrenia on its own. 

Tonight is random, but when I was looking at the symptoms and I’ve struggled with social anxiety for a while (where I think my friends don’t like me, tell myself things in my head in public and alone ect) and have even lately considered thinking I need to meet new people altogether because things just aren’t working out for me. I even have a gf who loves me and has for a few years. My friends all reassure me however, and I’m pretty sure Im normal but now I’m terrified that this is all sort of a delusion, or even worse, that my panic right now is going to bring on schizophrenia that I was never supposed to have. I’ve also had trouble sleeping for some time now and am extremely unfocused when it comes to school. 

Any reassurance or advice would be great as I can’t sleep anymore and am having a hard time trying to calm myself down. I’ve always been a very anxious person, especially when it comes to my health."
1188,Anxiety,A terrifying young adult milestone.,"If not more intelligent, I am at least more worldly and experienced than my parents now.

1189,Anxiety,I have a job interview today!!!,"I’ve been in food service for years and trying to get out of it. I’ve been applying for any job I can and today I have an interview for a front desk position. I’m SO nervous!!! 

I know that if I mess up or don’t get the job it won’t be the end of the world but I’ve been itching to work full time at an “adult” job so that I won’t be broke anymore. I’m tired of being a victim to my anxiety, tired of running away from potential opportunities because I’m afraid of putting myself out there. 

I used to have a hard time believing this but I’m a good person to have on a team! I’m honest and respectful, I work hard, learn new skills quickly, and have passion for a lot of things. I used to let these qualities be controlled by my fear of putting myself out there, but that ends TODAY! Now I’m channeling my nervous energy into unwavering confidence.

Wish me luck."
1190,Anxiety,Is it anxiety?,"Recently I’ve been having tics ever since i got nervous with getting the covid vaccine and when i think about the scratch my puppy gave me…it’s not obvious when twitching but I can feel it when it happens and it just annoys me too much…When im fidgeting (like tapping my foot, shaking my leg) or when im occupied with something it doesn’t really happen only when im thinking about myself twitching then I twitch and it scares me even more. I also think about my health too much and its been a month and I haven’t gotten any good sleep…can’t ask help from a professional since i’m only a minor ///"
1191,Anxiety,I’m feeling very hopeless and need to get this off my chest,"TW: SA, Death, Bullying


I’m in high school, I get straight As but I’ve been dealing with a lot and something snapped in me recently where I feel like I’ve completely given up. My mental health has been on a horrible decline since middle school. Unfortunately I experienced SA from another man my age. It was played for laughs in front of a large group of guys and a group of people I thought were my friends because they all thought I was gay and wanted to “test and see if I was” to mess with me, even though I wasn’t gay. I’m a straight man, and I was also young, so unfortunately I felt too embarrassed to speak about it. I didn’t even realize it had really effected my anxiety until this year. I have trouble being around groups of guys my age, I get this horrible feeling in my body where Im always on edge and feel like they’re going to do something to embarrass me. I have this constant unexplainable feeling every second I’m at school, and it progressively has gotten worse. My dog of 12 years recently passed away due to cancer, my family’s financial situation and living situation is at its worst, Ive recently found out a best friend of mine of 3 years SA his ex, I’ve been trying to fix my relationship with my father who I’ve had issues with since childhood, I’ve lost a sibling-like relationship I cherished with my cousin (who I am forced to live with) for my entire life, and I’ve been at my all time worst with my mental/physical health. This is all just this year so it feels way too overwhelming. We changed units about 2 weeks ago in all my classes and for some reason everything hit me at that exact time like a truck. I’ve been reaching my limit for a while now but I think I’ve reached way over it now. I’ve been missing school due to my anxiety, and I’ve been going to therapy but it doesn’t feel like it’s helping. We have a plan in place, but it requires me to hold out and continue going to school for a bit but I truly can’t deal with this anxiety more. It almost feels like I’m the only one seeing this as urgent. I’m really just looking for any sort of advice, as I just feel hopeless at this point."

1194,Anxiety,panic attack from covid booster symptoms?,"i already saw some medical professionals about this but wanted to see if anyone else had one. i woke up and started having hearing loss, body numbness and pins and needles, and my vision blacked out. i then threw up twice and have been ok since. the doctor i talked to said something triggered it from the booster side effects (probably the bad chills and shaking i had last night). ive never had a panic attack like this one but i think i’d gladly go back to the ones that feel like i just can’t breathe. anyways i’m on lexapro but missed some of my med doses recently :( i’m glad it’s nothing serious but it feels horrible contacting so many people because i feel like i’m dying and then it just turns out to be a new variant of panic attack."
1195,Anxiety,I Think I’ve done something illegal,"Me (16F) and my friend (16F) went round the town wheatpasting. Well, she put the posters up and I just accompanied her. 

There’s only a few people who saw us, but I’m still really anxious about getting a criminal record or being fined or have my parents or the college I go to finding out."
1196,Anxiety,Struggling,Feeling unwanted Hi  struggling a little anyone talk please on voicecall if anyone is available to talk just miss my mom she passed away 1 yeah ago today from pancreatic cancer.  I struggle with autism and depression and ocd I have no friends in real life except for online. It's hard to make friends sometimes.
1197,Anxiety,Why do you have fear? Why do not always be positive.,"I know it is hard to be positive when having fear or panic attacks. However, we should always try. Even when we force ourselves to be positive when feeling fear, we are training our minds. Why do people fear? I do not have many fear because I do not think about it. I do not fear from death, and from having health problems. Health problems can come from so much fear and anxiety. I always feel that I am good, and my health is great. I am not scared of having low blood pressure or any diseases. I am always positive and I beleive that this plays an important role. Even when going to sleep, many people are afraid from nightmares. It is important to know that goinh to bed without fear is one of the best things to sleep well. What do you think?"
1198,Anxiety,Review the side effects of your meds from time to time,"I've been visiting my doctor and three specialists for about a year for a wide variety of bizarre symptoms. Was really starting to question if I was falling apart. Decided to review the side effects of my anxiety medication. I knew that I had some of the common ones: the price of being on medication, but was surprised to see that the list of ""less common, but contact your doctor immediately"" pretty much matched my current symptoms.

Talked with my doctor and we are reducing my dosage and changing a couple things around. I'm not here to bash medication or medicine in general. I wouldn't have made it without them, but be educated, and review your prescription details. I didn't have any of these side effects when I first started. I try to be diligent and educate myself, but hadn't reviewed them in a while. 

Also, it is worth reading multiple (legitimate) sources. Read the paper from the pharmacy. Visit Mayo Clinic, and other respected information sources on medications. They may list things differently. The side effects list for mine was different on different sites.

While it is great to get information on Reddit, via friends, the web, social media, YouTube, etc., always talk to your doctor. Don't go off changing your medications or treatment based on something you read online. You can get a second opinion from another doctor, but *not what your uncle said he heard from his neighbor, who is totally a doctor.*

My point is be educated (from legitimate sources). Don't expect your doctor to know everything going on for you. They can't just hit you with a tri-corder and give you a diagnosis. Show up having done your homework, and be prepared to have a conversation about what is going on."
1199,Anxiety,I really struggle with sleeping,"I’m doing long distance with my girlfriend of two years, and lately our communication has gotten worse and it’s really been fueling my anxiety. I know it sounds dumb but I just don’t know what to do. And to make matters worse, every night I try to go to sleep and find myself tossing and turning for hours"
1200,Anxiety,Overwhelmed with thoughts and cannot stop,"Imagine having a annoying loud noise blasting away and you cant do anything for now to turn it off. Now turn that noise into thoughts. Get the picture now? I am overwhelmed with thoughts I really want peace and silence. Im still stressed I have not been able to just take a breather in this aspect. I am very tired. I should not be venting this but I just really pray for people who. are dealing with same issue. Its not fun, not fun at all."
1201,Anxiety,I hate it when people say life is what you make it,"okay yeah whatever, they're right i suppose, but sometimes it's just not that easy. my life is really unfulfilling and sometimes i'm used to it and other times, it brings me a lot of emotional pain. i feel like anxiety holds back from experiencing all the really good things in life. 

i mostly have anxiety around people my age due to being bullied in middle school which makes it really hard to make friends and be myself. i've always wanted a group of friends that i can go out and do things with, but i've never had the luxury. i'm a really lonely person and i spend almost every day trapped inside my room. i only see my best friend a couple times a month. hanging out with other people without being high on weed is always such an uncomfortable experience.

anxiety fucking sucks because it stops you from being happy. it makes you think you're worthless and that you shouldn't even try. 

i started zoloft, though,and hopefully things change. i just had to say how much i haaate that phrase! if i didn't have anxiety, my life would be so much more fulfilling. i wouldn't feel so incapable."
1202,Anxiety,power is out :(,my power went out so i tried to just sleep until it comes back on but i woke up and my anxiety is so bad. i’m shaking so much and there’s just butterflies in my stomach idk what to do. the power hasn’t gone out here in so long :(
1203,Anxiety,5:30am and I haven't slept,"I just joined this threat. I started a new job in September and since then feel very tired and more anxious than usual. I was in charge of an internal report and today at 5pm discovered that I had not made all the amendments to the report. Now I can't sleep (it's 5am here) for worrying and stressing. The report is now with a publishing team and we might need to pay an additional charge to get it amended again. 
I feel so overwhelmed at work and know I should be turning work down and not just agreeing to cover."
1204,Anxiety,I'm getting anxious at night even with xanax.,"I've been using xanax to help take the edge off anxiety before I go to sleep.  Recently, it stopped working and I still get anxiety at night. My body must have developed tolerance. I need help. I want to sleep without medicine, but for many years I've had a bad fear of insomnia which would keep me up and gave me panic attacks in bed. I need help getting off (or at least down) on medication and stop getting panicked about insomnia."

1206,Anxiety,i cant stop thinking about death and it’s haunting me," I apologize for any bad grammar or weird sentences, i’m in a frantic mindset and have one braincell working. 

I have very bad anxiety, my doctor told me it’s one of the worst anxiety tests he has seen. My biggest fear is death, and what happens after. I am not religious, I do not believe in Heaven and Hell. For some reason every night I cannot stop thinking about what happens when we die and I can’t stop having panic attacks where I cannot breathe and my body breaks out in hives. I don’t know what to do to stop this way of thinking and it’s tearing me apart. Does anyone have any tips of either a calming method or tips to not think of it?"
1207,Anxiety,Anxiety over catching covid,Hello Im 19 years old and ever since covid started I had a fear of catching covid. Over time it went away when I got the vaccine and started using logic again. But the fear is starting to come back.

1208,Anxiety,Ive had a panic attack for 3 hours,"Me and my friends were smoking some weed and drinking a bit when I noticed my heartrate rising (it raised so high I almost fainted and lost track or reality for a couple seconds), this then led to a panic attack and I honesly thought I was having a heart attack or a stroke. I then calmed myself with the help of my friends by taking deep breaths. But the negative thoughts made my heart race again with every negative thought. Its been almost 3 hours and while Im very tired, my heart is still at around 110-20bpm while faling asleep, making it worse. Ive walked a bit and washed my face that helped temporarily, I made sure I wasnt having a stroke by doing tests of it. But its still going on and I was wondering if anyone had any tips to make it better :/ thanks"
1209,Anxiety,Super Weird Tic from Brainspotting,"Hello r/anxiety! Hope everyone here is feeling ok, and if not, I hope you feel ok very soon. Short background of my issues in case it's relevant; I suffer from severe panic attacks and derealization, although I've been doing a lot better this past year thanks to lamictal and therapy. I have a weird issue that I wanted some feedback on. I've been doing therapy sessions for over a year with the same therapist, and recently, she has been utilizing this technique called ""brainspotting"" that's supposed to help heal past trauma. Here's a link in case anyone wants to know more- https://brainspotting.com/ Essentially, the mediator uses a pointer/pen of some sort, and tracks your eye movement from left to right until they notice a reaction in certain spots. Strong emotions can arise, as well as certain memories that are supposed to relate to where you are looking. I.e. If you had a traumatic experience getting hit with a baseball from the right side of your head, looking in the same spot you were when you got hit would bring up that memory and the emotions/physical feeling tied to it. Random not real example. So I did the first session with her, and since this concept seems pretty out there, I was skeptical. However, very strong emotions started to arise, as well as memories, and I left the session feeling very different. Could have been a placebo effect type situation, or me psyching myself into it, but nonetheless it felt real. I felt very relaxed and almost high (in a good way) coming out of it (kind of spaced out, laughing at random things, etc.) Which was interesting because weed causes me to panic 90% of the time I smoke, so I don't do that anymore. I did the second session today, 3 weeks later, and this time she added in audio stimulation. She gave me headphones that played music bouncing from the left ear to the right ear, supposedly to activate the right and left brain to get a full memory while tracking the pointer with my eyes. I didn't have as many memories come up this time, but a lot of different emotions. The biggest thing was a physical tic of shaking/nodding my head that felt somewhat uncontrollable. I've experienced this a bit before, mostly in times when I was at like a 10 level of panic. I also may have some minor OCD tendencies/ other small things like this, (my dad has moderate OCD) but they are usually manageable. I exited this brainspotting session feeling very weird, and the head nodding tic persisted. It looks like someone head banging at a concert very fast (I recorded myself to see what the hell it looks like from an outside perspective)It's been about 6 hours and I still am dealing with this tic. It's more severe than any one I've had before. I'm able to not do it if I'm focused on something else. But the second I lose focus I start uncontrollably nodding away. If I let myself do it it gets really intense and fast, and feels like I'm being jostled on a roller coaster. I don't even feel anxious or bad, I feel fine but this tic is persisting and really bothering me. I'm afraid it's not gonna go away. Does anyone have any experience with brainspotting/physical tics that can help me out? I would really appreciate it, I'd like to return back to normal. My therapist doesn't really know what to do either, she said she's brainstorming a solution. 

TLDR: Participated in a ""brainspotting"" session in therapy and came out of it with a physical tic head nodding tic that has lasted hours later"
1210,Anxiety,do I have anxiety?,"I always overthink a lot. For example tomorrow my friends and I are having a halloween party, and I decided to go in my mums clothes in the 80s. I thought it looked funny bc it kinda looked like a hospital gown. So I put it in the group chat and said stuff like “the fact that my mum was trendy back then” and “it looks like a hospital gown,  it looks kinda weird”. One of my friends replied saying “I think it’s pretty” and now I’m overthinking that I don’t have any gratefulness for my mum bc I was kinda making fun of her clothes. I also think that problems are a lot bigger than they are, thinking of the worst possible situations. Thanks. 😊"

1212,Anxiety,"M/29 Just started Sertraline 50mg. I'm starting off the first week at 25mg, but this nausea is awful. Any advice on how to get past it?"," A week and a half ago I started having panic attacks out of nowhere and even landed myself in the ER from not being able to eat along with the GI problems anxiety has caused. Not the way I wanted to lose weight, but down 20 pounds so far. 

 It's a struggle to eat, and my stomach is constantly in knots despite pepto, ginger ale, and tums. I know its all anxiety related to Sertraline not only offers a chance to have manageable anxiety (if any-hopefully) but also the chance to eat and enjoy food again. 

 I just need to get past this first wave of start up symptoms which are nausea, dizziness, and drowsiness. Headaches are common recently but that may be due to my constant battle of hydrating myself. 

Please, if anyone has any tips I would greatly appreciate  you sharing. Or even just sharing your experiences on Sertraline may offer some hope."
1213,Anxiety,Called the Paramedics today,"Backstory about me: (22M, with GAD and Agoraphobia)

Hey everybody,

I was having a vacation with my GF and my family. We went on this great outdoorsy resort out that was about an hour from where I was at. We decided to go together as a family. We we’re heading there and as soon as we hit the freeway I was already anxious. (Ive never had issues with freeways in the past but recently these past few months have been hard dealing with highway anxiety). 

A couple minutes in my breathing starts to shallow and my face gets really numb and tingly. I was scared that something might happen, so we pulled over on the side of the road for me to catch a breather. I felt fine after doing some exercises, after that we went back on the road, but this time I kept my eyes closed and covered with some earbuds on to keep me distracted.. that helped. 

We get to the resort, it was fun, amazing and overall a great time!! I had zero anxiety the entire time! Everything went smooth sailing! Then once we left and packed up our cars with our luggage, in my mind I was dreading the ride back. 

So in my head im freaking out already and my skin becomes clammy and my head gets dizzy. We begin to head to the road, and im already feeling uncomfortable. My family is fully aware of my condition and they asked if I was okay. I said yes but in my head I was already panicking. All of sudden, I get really hot and faint. I start to become numb from the top down, and I begin to freak out in the car. I tell my family to pull over. I hop out the car and im hyperventilating and I feel like im going to pass out.

My options are limited, my family and my girlfriend tried to calm me down, but that didnt help. I told my girlfriend to call 911 cause I felt like i was going to die then and there. So she did, they took a while too and during the wait it felt so bad and long. My family is trying their best to keep me cool calm and collected but that didnt help. 

The paramedics arrive and talked to me. Suddenly I feel so safe and my symptoms begin to slowly dissipate. I tell them that im embarrassed that this happened. But they told me to not be sorry. I suddenly felt so secured and reassured and asked me if they  want them to take me to the hospital but my family insisted them that we will be okay. 

They leave, and in my head i feel so ashamed on what happened. We drive back and Im just super quiet. Im just sad that this isnt something new to me. 

Previously my doctor prescribed me Atarax and Lexapro to help battling GAD, Agoraphobia and Depression that I deal with, but im afraid to start. What can I do to get over this hump??"
1214,Anxiety,Is my fatigue from the anxiety or from the anxiety meds?,"The endless question.
How do I even tell?"
1215,Anxiety,DAE get really anxious from the realization of the passing of time?,"Like when holidays, like Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas, etc., come up you realize, wow, it's that time already? And you think about the last few months and realize you haven't progressed in life, you're still in the same place. Then a wave of anxiety just washes over..."
1216,Anxiety,Frustrating interaction with a contractor that’s ruined my day/week/who knows how long,"Hey all,

It’s been a really rough few days. 

I’ll lay out the basic scenario. 

We live in an area that has weird water that damages the fittings in water pipes. This resulted in a late night emergency where my brother in law who lives in our suite got his entire room soaked with water. 

We got a few quotes but contacted our neighbor who had the same issue (I actually saw the piping coming in and thought good god, please don’t let that be us….) and their plumber was half the price of anyone else I’d called in. She was happy with the work done and so I jumped on board. 

My expectation was the guy who saw the work was going to be leading the charge and doing a lot of the actual work. I then found out it was going to be his employee who would be doing most the work, as he did “most of the work” at our neighbors house. This ended up being all of the work. 

He was late every day. But he was a nice guy and I appreciated that. But one day, just before a holiday, he didn’t check his work and I get a panicked call from my brother in law that there’s a leak and it’s dripping out from above his window. 

Now what I should have done was contacted my insurance company and just had them deal with it, but I didn’t want to have to deal with that fallout. 

I had drywall guys who were still working on my neighbors house come over after checking with the boss. Explaining if he wanted me to have them remove it and that there would be a decent amount. I had no idea what the cost would be. 

Mistakes were made. 

Fast forward to a few days ago. I paid for the plumbing work and asked the drywall guys to contact the boss about the work. It was more than he expected and basically offered to pay half. 

To clarify there weren’t just one or two errors made. the guy doing the work didn’t crimp a connection under the bathtub properly, it was a small leak but still a leak. He swapped the hot and cold taps for our bathroom upstairs, our shower upstairs and after ASSURING me it wasn’t messed up the hot and cold were swapped in my washer and I almost destroyed an entire load of laundry.  

I will admit that they did a fair few extras that weren’t initially in the cards, which was not discussed but I figured was some level of apology for the constant mistakes. 

I stood my ground as the error was on them, and I’m already out at this point 5 figures in unexpected repairs that a perfect nail in target to my anxiety as it’s just more debt hanging over my shoulder. 

Things escalated extensively. To the point that that offer went down by $100 and then I got a massive text from the guy who did all the work, basically saying they won’t pay a dime and will be charging for the lost labor and travel charges. 

Thankfully after explaining this to the drywall guys they are going to help out, but I don’t know how to deal with the fallout now. I’ve got these massive messages and these temper tantrums “you just complain and want this stuff for free” which, wtf - it’s just put my anxiety at a 10. I don’t think my heart rate has dropped since this started this afternoon. 

I don’t know if I should reply. If I should just say the end of it. Or what I should do. A really big part of me wants to put a button on it. A part of me wants to write a review and tell it like it is. 

Ugh. I just need someone to just I dunno. I just don’t know."
1217,Anxiety,Can’t sleep due to racing mind &amp; heart.,"This has possibly been happening to me a lot lately, I get a racing heart and a fluttering feeling through my body when I try to sleep.  This often happens when I’m going out the next day and because of this I am sleep deprived to high hell and I really want to go out and enjoy myself but how can I on a lack of sleep? This is honestly sucks and anxiety sucks too."

1219,Anxiety,"Every once in a while I'm so afraid of literal monsters, demons, etc. Usually only when I'm home alone. Like I'm afraid to look in mirrors, close my eyes (especially in bed) and turn off lights. I know no such things exist, yet my minds eye insists. The bumps at night are terrifying. Anyone else?","I'm old enough that this really shouldn't be a problem. Was always and still am afraid of home intruders and I think this is sort of related. Like, at least I could try and fight a guy, or hear him coming. Can't do that with a horror movie monster/ghost/demon lol"
1220,Anxiety,"Might help some, because these things help me","when i’m feeling anxious and too “in my head”, i listen to calming music. at least music i find calming. Ambient stuff. 

Boards of Canada - Left Side Drive
Gaussian Curve - Impossible Island 
(actually this whole album: Clouds)

These are a few examples, but I could send more music to anyone if they enjoy. 


What else I do? watch youtube videos of people cooking. the imperfect ones with less views. go to Google Earth to check out different places around the world. Sit outside and look at the stars, or maybe go for a drive outside of town (if you can drive or aren’t too anxious to do this).

Give yourself a break and don’t be too hard on yourself, because you’re not alone!"
1221,Anxiety,DAE have consistent nervous habits?,"Hey all!

In the past couple years, I’ve realized when I’m actively anxious or stressed, I have this anxious habit of swallowing. I’m sure this partially steams from my fear of choking and feeling like I “don’t have enough air,” but it’s distressing to experience in public. It gets to the point where I can’t drink or eat until I finally calm down. Does anyone else here have a similar issue? Does anything help you?"
1222,Anxiety,i just drank caffiene and now i’m feeling overstimulated,i don’t drink coffee much but when i do i never really notice anything but this time i drank some at like 12 am and i feel super restless and i just feel like dojng something and i’m not enjoying the feeling that much it’s making me very shaky and i keep shaking my legs. this is about to trigger some health anxiety loll

1225,Anxiety,DAE thinking people are recording them,"i have this habit of thinking that people are recording me. not in public. i mean like if people leave my house to get something and will be back in 30 min i assume they have left a camera or something, they want to see what im like alone and mock me and laugh at how different i am with them. even when i was in my tweens i would think my parents had put cameras in the house that were secretly recording all the time, i’d think of how unethical it would be for them to be doing this in bathrooms and bedrooms and how it didn’t make sense for them to only record the common areas so they must be in private ones too. It didn’t even align with my parents, they barely knew i existed let alone cared what i did. anyways, i feel weird and shitty about this notion that i cannot let go of and i’m wondering if maybe its a part of my anxiety"

1228,Anxiety,Am I having anxiety attacks?,"Hi all. Male in my 30s here, 6ft tall and about 72kilos. For a few months now I've been waking at night with my heart suddenly beating fast (Fitbit says like 110-120bpm and my resting is 63bpm). I've called an ambulance once as I thought I was having a heart attack. Ambulance crew checked me over and said all vitals were fine. Have been to doctor about 3 times now and on each occasion the blood test and checks on my heart, lungs etc with stethoscope didn't provide him any concern. I am going to get a heart monitor from doctor to see if there is a reason for palpitations but doctor thinks anxiety is most likely. I know in light of the above what I'm about to say sounds crazy but I can't shake the worry that there is something wrong with my heart, and each time I get a racing heart I fear it is a heart attack. Just wondering if anyone else here has experienced similar, and guess I'm looking for reassurance. Feeling lost, sad and worried. Hopefully within community rules, apologies if not."
1229,Anxiety,a lesson about overthinking,"i wanted to share a lesson i learned today about how always imagining the worst can hold you back.

so since it’s halloweekend, i dressed up in my costume and posted a picture to my snapchat story. my ex boyfriend’s good friend, who i used to mess around with before dating my ex, responded to the post and complimented my outfit. this caught me very off guard as we haven’t talked in ages.

he then asked me if i had anyone dressing up as my characters bf in the show. not gonna lie, i was freaking the hell out. 

the overthinking naturally took over, and kinda put a dark cloud over my night. i was trapped in my own head, considering a million negative scenarios….. maybe he was pranking me, maybe my frizzy ass hair was overshadowing my outfit, maybe he was with my ex and they were trying to see my reaction, maybe he’s trying to hook up (which i am not interested in)….

i thanked him for the compliment and asked him what he was being for halloween. he told me that him and his boyfriend were doing a couples costume. i was shocked, and questioned further. he told me about how he came out as bisexual and has been happier than ever since finding his true self. this really struck a chord with me as i am bisexual as well. 

we talked a bit about our coming out experiences and he described how his friend group (my ex and his friends) had cut him off due to his sexuality. he wants more friends who can understand and relate to him, appreciating who he truly is. 

i feel like a total moron for letting my overthinking define my night. i was too concerned on the potential negative scenarios to consider that someone could have good intentions. 

had i let this overthinking control me, both he and i would have had one less friend we can relate to. i could’ve spent my whole night in fear of the possibilities instead of pushing my limits and being pleasantly surprised. 

i really know now not to judge an interaction by its appearance. just because something is a possibility doesn’t mean it will happen. 

overthinking almost cost me a relationship with someone great, so please remember this next time you’re considering taking that leap of faith :)"
1230,Anxiety,I wish my brain would just be quiet,"This is my first time posting and I’m a little nervous about it, yet at the same time I’m just hoping I can find someone to understand.

I feel so alone with my anxiety, i don’t have anyone in my life that fully understands how debilitating this can be. Most of the time I’m just stuck in this confusion of “why?”. For example, “why can’t my brain just quiet down?”, “what is productive about this constant worry and fear?” and especially “why me?”. I know that I’m not the only one who deals with this but at times it can be so difficult to not feel like the world is out to get me, better yet my own brain. 

I just feel like I’m at a standstill, just a constant cycle of me trying to push through my life, trying to believe that I can do it all by myself. I wish I could go to school, or work, or even just go into any type of social situation without thinking about thousands of different things that can go wrong. To put it simply I just wanna be able to function “normally”, whatever that means. 

I don’t know how to get myself help, and I don’t really know how to accept it either. I’ve finally found a great therapist that really understands me, yet I know I need more. How do I do this? Even writing this down I’m scared of the silent judgement this post might receive just in the brains of the people reading this. 

If you did take the time to look this over, I would really appreciate any kind words in the comments, even if it’s short. Sending love to all of you!"
1231,Anxiety,constant pain/discomfort due to muscle tension,"because i am so anxious 100% of the time, my muscles are constantly super tensed; in particular, i feel like i physically cannot relax my facial muscles and my jaw is constantly clenched on one side (and i’m sure it’s even worse when i sleep, which can’t be doing me any favors). i am always uncomfortable and/or in pain - pretty much all over, but especially in my jaw (and face in general?), neck, and back, plus constant headaches, sometimes migraines. seriously, it feels like it NEVER stops and i can never relax - at this point my “resting” face is a tightly clenched jaw and furrowed brow; that’s just automatically what they do.

does anyone else experience this and know of any solutions, or at least methods of reducing the tension/pain/discomfort? i’m only in my mid-20s and i already feel so decrepit and achy - and i can only imagine it’ll continue to worsen over time. the main solution i’ve come across online is to “reduce stress in your life” but like, how do you do that when you are biologically predisposed to a perpetual state of fight-or-flight? i’ve had pretty severe anxiety (general and social) for my entire life and i am so EXHAUSTED. it just never stops.

thanks in advance for any help!"
1232,Anxiety,getting insane anxiety and dread from being around drunk people," Is anyone else like this ? I feel like I'm losing my mind even more bc it seems like I'm the only one bothered. But basically I cant stand being around drunk people specifically drunk men. Mabe it's because I'm a girl so I just always imagine the worst happening to me ?    


But just being in the same house with a guy (family member at that) that is wasted gives me this insane amount of dread...i am literally unable to sleep because I'm so scared. And I do not know why or the logic behind it because no single event has causes this? Like a drunk person has never done anything bad to me so idk why im like this.    


My brother keeps coming home drunk (2 days in a row now) and its Halloween weekend so I know him and his friends will be drunk again the next three days. And its really fucking with me. Today I locked myself in my bedroom and just blasted music to take my mind off it and calm down, but it's not working. And I dont think im going to be able to handle another 3 days of this.   


And it's not like I can ask him to stop. Like he should be able to drink whatever its his body.  But i hate feeling like this and i seriously think im going to have a breakdown tomorrow when him and his friends are over drunk again.   


Does anyone else experience this? Or have any tips to calm down ? I feel so sick with dread"
1233,Anxiety,clorox bleach ..,"this might sound dumb but does anyone else get anxiety by cleaning with bleach ? today i was cleaning my bathroom and i used a lot of bleach because i was deep cleaning . now my chest hurts but i can’t even tell if it’s the bleach or my anxiety . while i’m cleaning i think about irrational thoughts like what if the fumes get inside my lungs and burns them ? or oh no i accident mixed my bleach with another (compatible) cleaning solution it’s going to kill me. as you guys can tell i’m stressing over this . and it happens every time i clean the bathroom ugh :/ i live in a apartment so there’s no windows near the bathroom to open just the ventilator. anyways i should go to sleep , if i don’t wake up , it was the bleach . 

 at least the bathroom is clean :))"
1234,Anxiety,Neck hurting ouchy - anxiety is a real illness that can affect you physically,"The back of and the back sides of my neck hurt like hell especially when I'm really anxious that week. It hurt sooo bad today because I had a panic attack yesterday. 

I feel like it's probably due to a couple reasons mainly being the fact that I tense up there when I'm anxious. So I exhaust that series of muscles. Gotta get neck rubs and use self massage tools to loosen up the muscles. 

Just a reminder that my mental illness is valid and I need to take care of it since I am affected by it physically as well as mentally. Its getting worst as I get older too 😩"

1236,Anxiety,How is anxiety?,"When I was 18 I had clonazepam and prozac prescribed but witdrew because my parents coudl not afford it. After that I've been trying to go to therapy but never seems to work, it's hard for me to make friends and to socialize in general, because of this I've lost many jobs, Im 34, lost actually two different jobs in one month, Im about to be kicked out of the apartment I rent with a friend, the thing is that many times I've been suggested that Im just lazy and that I just take the easy way out, I can only describe it as feel a lot of fear but for nothing really. When I read the way people here describe their anxiety I can't relate that much to those experiences specially the breathing, I breathe normally but I just feel the urgency to escape no matter what Im leaving behind. Does anybody experience their anxiety like this?"
1237,Anxiety,The worst situations for me,"I’m just writing this to see if others can relate with this because sometimes I feel like I am losing my mind.

So I’ve noticed a pattern for my anxiety, that being that situations where my level of control is vague are the absolute worst. I’m normally pretty well adjusted and cope well, but when those situations occur I feel so overwhelmed. 

Situations that are out of my control? Fine, that’s life, I go with the flow. Situations that are in my control? No problem, no matter the challenge.

But situations where I either have to wait or practice extreme measures drive me up the wall. For instance:

A) Health scares. I have an odd, vague symptom. Could be nothing, but could be horrible. Only thing to do is either wait or go through expensive and major evaluations to get clarity.

B) Flying. I have control to panic and leave the plane up until take off after which I have to just wait and suffer.

Or like this morning. My boyfriend left for work in the center of the city (Saturday/Sunday mornings are always the most restless because not a lot of people and all that is left are a few commuters and then some undesirable characters). He’s not really a big city person so he doesn’t always really exercise the same level of caution. He always sends me a message when he gets to his work safe in these situations, but this morning he didn’t. Then my calls/messages didn’t even go through to him. I panic and assume the worst and my choices are to do something frantic (call the police? What? I don’t know), or just assume it’s nothing and wait it out. Well I succumbed to my anxiety and called his office and through that confirmed he got there safe. I was morbidly embarrassed about my freak out (and still hate myself for it).

I just wish I could be more mellow in those situations, that my mind wouldn’t take me to the worst case scenarios, but then again I’m afraid that by being cavalier, something horrible will come out of it and then I will end up regretting not doing anything.

Can anyone else relate? Any advice how to learn how to just throw caution to the wind and let these moments slide so I don’t have to either make panic moves (that resolve the fear but at what cost), nor suffer for opting to be indifferent. 

I hate how vivid my mind is and how I’m able to look at the big picture too well sometimes. Makes me great at my own job, but at what cost."
1238,Anxiety,Anxious to get vaccinated,"Deep down inside, I want it. I know I will be fine. But my anxiety is overtaking my thoughts. Whenever I hear people talk about it, my mind goes on a downward spiral of fear. That's why I try to distract myself from it. Right now, I'm planning to go to a psychologist and ask about it.

I'm scard because early this year, I really had a bad trip of marijuana and meds the following month. Now, my body is sensitive. But I know, my immune system is healthy and I don't really feel that there's something is wrong with me. All I know is my anxiety.

How do I get over this? I'm asking for people to re-assure me and give me advice. Encourage me. Thanks"
1239,Anxiety,Please read🙏🏻🥺,"Every time I convince myself I’m alright, I always get anxiety attacks or panic attacks. I tend to hyperventilate I think when this happens. I’ll be sitting down playing a game with friends, and then I move around and can’t sit still in my chair, then I’d hyperventilate and breathe weird… 
Sometimes I can control it, sometimes I can’t. But when I hyperventilate I start to freak out and then actually feel like I’m gonna die on the spot. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety by my doctor. Same thing happens on highways , even at my girlfriends house. Her mom made food and I completely could not contain myself. Kinda had to let them know i have anxiety and shit. But recently I’ve noticed me getting to my older self which is good. But when I feel like it’s getting good, this panic happens. I feel like im right there with this whole thing of anxiety . I never thought I’d be like this . Its like I’m constantly moving around and when I stay still for 2 min I start to try to focus on breathing then end up feeling dizzy and scared. I just really am tired of this . I really want some advice on how to handle this anxiety and panic. I just always feel like I’m about to die on the spot, it’s very weird. 
Advice???"
1240,Anxiety,Anyone else get these physical symptoms?,"Sometimes when i wake up in the middle of the night my vision is distorted like out of focus and it needs to focus properly which panics me and after a few secs it sorts it self out. When i am between sleep and awake i see flashes of light in random areas of my eyelids at random times when my eyes are closed. Also when my eyes are closed i see moving lines and shapes and loads of other weird things mainly when i wake up in the middle of the night and when i try go back to sleep but after a few secs that goes away. I am guessing that’s just adrenaline i don’t know unless it’s just my anxiety and stress i suffer with. I am on my 4 weeks of amitripyln 10mg to help with sleep and tension headaches and 20mg citalopram. I am gunna give it another 2 weeks and see if things get better. I just don’t want to see or come across any weird things, if i wake up i wake up, i just want to feel normal when trying to sleep."
1241,Anxiety,I try to not check my story on Instagram. Do you check that who looks at them?,"I try to not check because I wanna that post stories on Instagram for myself, not anybody else.

Before the pandemic, I got movies, theaters, abroad travels and I posted them on Instagram Story. I didn't try to show my life as amazing. Just I wanted to share them and I did.

In this situation, Not checking is easy but there is an exception that hurts and causes anxiety.

When I love or care very much about somebody, I check that she looks or not. If not, I ask why. Especially, she posts a story on Instagram after me and does not look my stroy, I ask why double times and As I have said when everything is normal, not checking is easy. But, otherwise is annoying.

In the past, I checked every time when I had posted it but I understood It was bullshit. Because This is my life but nobody's.

Since the end of September, I've posted, and unfortunately, I sometimes checked that My crush looked or not. I know it doesn't matter but...

Anyway, Hope I do not check anymore.

How about, Do you check that who looks at them?"

I’ve broken down and cried, I’ve had panic attacks in front of my girlfriends family. Like it was fuckin embarrassing lol. But lately I’ve kinda been feeling like my old self again ngl. Don’t get me wrong I get the worst of worst attacks, like I’m about to die on the spot or something. But I’ve been feeling honestly decent tbh. Will prob have an attack again, but maybe I won’t. What if tomorrow is actually a good fucking day? What if I decide to hit some push ups , sit ups, take out my dog, maybe not sleep at fucking 5 lol. Point is, there is actually a peaceful light at the end of this terror. I see it. Happiness. And trust me man I thought I was fuckin down and out. Fuvk I even had a panic attack today, but it went away like usual. Please don’t quit guys I’m a 21 male and just want to help some ppl and also receive advice. I’m not gonna run from this anymore. I haven’t run from it. I want to learn."
1244,Anxiety,Does anyone get super anxious when having to or wanting to describe yourself to others?,"I don't usually get anxious. I was more anxious a few years ago, most of the time.

Nowadays, only a handful of situations make me shake with anxiety.

One of them is describing myself. Be it for classmates, for friends/family members, for a dating app or simply to write a diary, I get really anxious.

What can I do to get over this? It seems a silly reason to get anxious, in my opinion."
1245,Anxiety,How to stop getting so anxious about pregnancy,"This is a really new problem for me and I'm a little concerned. I've had anxiety for a while, and I'm going to group counseling for it, but it feels like my anxiety just gives me a new problem every few weeks. The most recent problem is being anxious about getting pregnant, and it actually affecting my health. I'm only 19, and I'm on birth control, but lately even thinking about the ""what if's"" surrounding birth control and pregnancy make me feel nauseous. It seems to happen around when I go to bed and my thoughts race the most. Within a few hours I throw up, feel better, and go to bed. This has happened twice in the past week, and I'm starting to be concerned. The first time I threw up, and the second time I didn't but I felt incredibly nauseous all night. I've only missed one pill, but it was way after the last time I did anything so I know I can't be pregnant, but the thought still makes me nauseous and anxious.  Why is this happening now when I was fine before? How can I stop feeling so sick just from the thought of my birth control magically failing me and I get pregnant? Any tips or advice is greatly appreciated."
1246,Anxiety,How to get rid of tense feeling?,"For short my health anxiety has been the worst over the past month because of a swollen lymph node that showed up after bad acne, I had one panic attack after the other almost every day, my appetite was horrible mainly because of the fact the attacks triggered my GERD and shortness of breath. 

Eventually I got treated for my GERD, appetite came back and I'm feeling better than when it started but I'm still assuming that I'm tense. My shortness of breath feels like the sensation you get after you cry, it feels better when I'm distracted (i.e. Falling asleep, doing anything that requires full focus) which is my most worrying symptom. I always yawn and hyperventilate. 

I'm wondering if anyone who has experienced this found a way to lessen the severity of feeling tense and if anxiety symptoms can last for a while."
1247,Anxiety,Extreme anxiety after drinking what can I do now to fix it,"So I rarely drink but when I do I have really bad anxiety and I also feel depressed for days sometimes longer. I know why this happens and it's why I don't drink. Last night I drank for the first time in ages and got really drunk. I just woke up (it's 10am) and I have really bad anxiety I don't know what to do I can't handle this. 

My question is what can I do to ease the anxiety?"
1248,Anxiety,16 and depressed,"I have never made a Reddit post before but I found this forum and wanted to share my story. I’m 16 years old and have never really had trouble making friends. I’ve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don’t do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it’s gotten to the point where I don’t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it’s too late to fix them. Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I’ve always felt like a failure because I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I’m not very shy but I’m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don’t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don’t see me making friends with anyone there because it’s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don’t know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I’m not the only one facing stuff like this."
1249,Anxiety,Anyone else get this?,When i close my eyes on a night to sleep my eyes aren’t physically moving but not sure if it’s my eyes or eye lids feel like they are fluttering when i try sleep. Is that from being tired and not having enough sleep and just my anxiety and stress?

1251,Anxiety,Worst months in my life (I need help comments),"First of all, sorry I'm not english native.

Hi to everyone, I'm 21 years old and going throught the worst shit that happened in my life.  
 My life is hell, I have problems since I was a kid because they bullied me, I hated school,  i was afraid because of this. But now after years that I finished it (3 years) I got problems with other shits that are draining my life  essence. In 2019 I got several and continous sleeping problems and Breathing OCD, that year was tough, but everything got worse this year.

I mean 2020 the year of the pandemic I was better, this year was being fine but in July everything change in my life, my problems were back and I couldn't resist them, I started to go to a therapist, and man it's really hard.

 Last 2 months are complicated but the last one, all october was one of a shit month, I feel i'm sick. Maybe you can help,  maybe some of you went through this. My emotions are altered as hell, like everything that happens to me is in 100% emotional-sensitive level. I have a terrible breathing OCD,  I feel like I'm fighting every minute that pass, but now I'm writting this because I simply CAN'T SLEEP, worst thing i'm afraid of sleeping but I want to sleep (today not even an hour, yesterday 4 hours, before yesterday 5 hours).

1254,Anxiety,Can anxiety cause persistent numbness and other symptoms? Health anxiety is kicking my ass rn :/,"So I have been diagnosed with social anxiety a few years back, and nothing else, but I do suspect that I have severe generalized anxiety disorder, or something similar that causes frequent worrying and distress. I'm also aware that I'm a very mentally unwell person, and very well may be dealing with other more severe affections.

I started getting depersonalization around 2 years ago and it has stayed with me 24/7 and taken a huge toll on my mind and body.

I'm also not able to get treatment or even see a doctor for anyone for this for a long time.

Needless to say, I'm a constant nervous wreck.

But something that's really got me scared now, is numbness.

About 2 months ago, I had some weird numbness in my back that didnt go away, and began to stress throughout my body, to my legs, hips area, arms, and even my face.

After a while, most of this went away or at least feeling returned a good bit.

But now I still have numbness in my eyelids, behind my right ear, in some spots on my back  and in 2 little spots on my hands.

I also been having weird circulation and weird sensations in my fingers.

This never goes away, but the intensity of these sensations vary, sometimes feeling returns a Good bit, and it just feels slightly numb, and then it can intensify a lot, and feel extremely lacking in sensation. 

I've noticed no muscle weakness or any physical disability in these areas, everything is working fine, and movement is a-ok but the sensation is just not there.

I have really bad health anxiety and I've convinced myself a lot of times now that I have brain cancer or a similarly destructive illness , which has really scared me.

It's just so weird because when I get anxious or panicked, or my stress gets bad or I'm having a panic attack, this all gets a lot worse, and when I focus on them they get worse too, but they still remain there, 24 7.

As far as I know if it was caused by a brain tumor, there wouldn't be any instances of feeling returning, or it getting better, and it would just be on one side of my body and limited to one small area. But my mind runs rampant.

I'm just curious if anyone has experienced this? 

Or more generally, if anyone experiences symptoms that last persistently even tho they're more calm than usual? 

This shits jus really stressful man my birthday in 2 days and I just don't wanna be be able to relax 😂😂😭"
1255,Anxiety,Waking up early?,"Does anyone else not have an issue falling asleep,  but waking up early and not being able to go back to sleep even if you feel tired? It’s been happening a lot recently. I wake up between 5-7 am even on my days off and can’t go back to sleep. It’s like my mind starts racing and then I become super hyper aware of my heart beating. Does anyone have this or have any tips on how to maybe go back to sleep?"
1256,Anxiety,What do I say to my friend who dismissed my anxiety?,"I just would like some help with some clarity in this situation. 

My close friend is anti-vax and has been worried as I’m booked in to get it Monday (NZ but yes I’m slow to get it because of my  anxiety, I am not worried about the safety and keen to get it)

He is very worried for me and so tonight was telling me some stories of peoples bad reactions, i just listen politely to this shit it’s not worth getting into as he is adamant. He described the adverse reaction of one particular person as extreme anxiety - he went on and described so so many more anxiety symptoms… I was feeling excited to say That’s how I feel every moment!! I went on to say those sound just like my symptoms from GAD. I was happy because my friend seemed to understand how bad the symptoms where in the man he described - he really understood how terrible it is. So I said now you know more about how I feel, he responded that it was different because that man had never suffered this before. 


If found that weirdly crushing, it was dismissive right?"
1257,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they're faking?,"I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and taken medication on and off for the past four years. Right now it's so bad even thinking about going in to work makes me throw up and I can barely eat. I tried to have a conversation with my boss about it and just ended up crying, hung up, and had a panic attack. 

And I STILL have this voice like ""You just don't want to work."" ""It's not that serious"" ""You're just super emotional.""

How do you guys combat that voice? This is the worst I've ever felt and it is constantly going in my head unless I distract myself."
1258,Anxiety,Health anxiety is getting hard,"Hi, guys. Just posting here to see if someone has a story similar to mine. 

I got covid one year ago. I was stuck in my room for 7 weaks and I can say that that experience has been ruining my life since then. I already suffered from anxiety before, but after this episode, became worst and worst, starting to affect all fields of my life, from my relationships to my work. Particularly my health and my pannic of getting sick. 

Six mounths ago, I start to develop some kind of hipocondria, when I found an axilar node in my arm. In that time (even before going to my doctor), i was completely convinced that i had breast cancer, and my life was all around that. 
I went to the doctor, got some exams, and nothing was found. Just an inflamatory ganglion for aparent no reason. Since then, the nodule comes and go, so my doctor told me that could be some hormonal disrugalion, and send me to and endocrinologist (I did not had this appointment yet). 

The scary thing is that, one week ago, I found another nodule in the opposite arm. My world ruined. I became obcessed again, searching online and constantly observing my two arms. I dont know how to do anymore. All my friends tell me that i need to stop pannicking and that everyting is fine with me, and this is all my anxiety affecting my whole body. 

What do you guys think?"
1259,Anxiety,Argument with a friend,"I was out with a friend last night before going to the cinema with a few more. We were walking and talking and everything was fine, until she mentioned about a new place in town that I talked about, in which I described to her wrongly. The place in question is a new gaming area.

I asked how did I describe it wrong, and she said from my description of the place it was going to be huge but in reality it was small to which I said but from my description I didn't specify what size it was so your own expectation disappointed you. So we got into a stupid argument to prove who was right, and I got a little bit stirred up until we shut down the argument because of how pointlessly stupid it was. Like who cares. But I was kinda cooling down because I got a little heated because I was told I was wrong and I gave a bad explanation of something I know I didn't. 

I get paranoid about how I describe things because I know I usually leave out specific details from some things, but I know I didn't leave anything out from that. 

So I collected another friend on the way to the cinema, and she brought up the argument and they both were ganging up on me saying how badly I described the place. And got on me how I said they were gonna have tables and areas to play other stuff, but when I actually said they were in the works. And how I called it a gaming cafe when they said it was a gaming lounge. Getting on my case about specifics.

So it got to me, and I just stayed quiet when I got to the cinema/bowling alley because I was annoyed and didn't want to say anything hurtful in my annoyed state. We played bowling before the movie and the annoyed energy got transferred into my bowling skills which carried me through the first few rounds, and they were all joking and having a laugh but I just couldn't get on that level with them. 

We go to the movie and we're sitting down to watch Dune. And the movie was good, but I just don't think it's my kind of movie. But I couldn't really focus on the film because I got a chance to be quiet and think. And then the anxiety kicks in of whether or not my friends think I'm smart or that they like to gang up on me and give me shit for things. Because it's not the first time the two of them have made me feel like this where I'm dwelling on a conversation I've had with them where they call me out and I'm left replaying the whole confrontation over and over in my head. 

At the end of the movie, the friend I sat beside thought I didn't enjoy the movie because he noticed I was sighing alot and just didn't seem to vibe with it. They were then saying things like ""Yeah I understand why you wouldn't like it"" kinda making it seem as if I can't enjoy that kind of film.

I don't even know why I'm posting here, I just feel like shit and anxious and like a grump. I feel like I'm just making a mountain out of a mole hill, but it's kinda set me off too... UGHHH"
1260,Anxiety,Anxiety causing gastro problems for the last three weeks,I’ve come to the realization that my anxiety might be causing all my gastrointestinal distress this month. I had an actual stomach virus but then I gave a notice to my job because I got a new one. I’m very stressed about starting a new job as the other job is the only one I’ve had. My symptoms aren’t consistent either. Some days they’re bad. Some days they’re non existent. Usually I wake up to diarrhea and nausea in the morning that gets better throughout the day until it’s almost gone completely at night. Does anyone else get this?
1261,Anxiety,(TW) Thinking about going on meds,"
TRIGGER WARNING!! This post talks about depression, suicidal thoughts and eating disorders. 

I had anxiety pretty much all my life. Even as  a child I would avoid social situations, and binge eat to cope with anxiety. I had extreme paranoia of leaving my house, never spoke up in class, had trouble meeting people, and I genuinely don't know how many times I cried when giving public speeches. I became aware of my anxiety when I was 14 and had a panic attack during a concert. Between 14-16 my anxiety got so much worse. I was depressed, isolated, obsessive, and aggressive. At that time my binge eating transformed into anorexia and bulimia. I basically hit rock bottom. I ended up seeing multiple psychiatrists. None of them could help me, mostly bc we just didn't match. It's extremely hard and EXPENSIVE to find a good psychiatrist/therapist that you get along with. I ended up giving up on therapy and my family also lost their fate in psychological help. They denied my requests to find a new professional. Psychological help costs so much so I never insisted. 

It took me about 2 years to get my ED under control. I never wanted to heal from ED bc it provided me a sense of comfort and security. It made me feel in control since I was never able to control my feelings and anxiety. It's been about 5 years since I started actively reading and researching about psychology. I specifically took courses in uni to help me along the way. When COVID began, I was keen to find and heal my traumas. I started journaling, doing inner work, and I was shocked by all that I'd bottled up. My mental health started improving immensely. I no longer starved myself. I started eating a balanced healthy diet, doing daily exercises, reading, journaling, meditating and implementing other rituals that kept me grounded. I've become extremely self aware. I am aware of my triggers, traumas, body responses etc. However, all the work I put into healing myself just doesn't seem to be enough. I am doing better but that doesn't mean I have mental stability. I still have anxiety, depressive episodes, suicidal thoughts, obsessions, compulsions and body dysmorphia. I know why I have these, when they are triggered but for some reason I just can't get rid of these mental issues. Especially in fall time my mental issues become so much worse. I am always very hopeful and happy during summer. I feel like there's something wrong with my brain chemistry, some sort of imbalance. I just don't feel like my mental health issues are solely trauma based. Because no matter how mindful I am, how much I take care of mysef, show compassion, I just can't have ease in my mind. 
My father's side of the family has a history of severe mental health issues. My father is bipolar, has anxiety, depression, OCD and eating disorders. I am very much like my father in terms of my personality, even the way we think is the same. I used to be against medication but now I feel like it's the only choice left for me. I can't live the rest of my life like this. I don't want to and frankly I don't think I can handle the turmoil in my head any longer. 

Can some of you share your experience with medication? Did it help you? Did you have side effects? Did you try everything before going on meds? Please let me know."
1262,Anxiety,I'm having uncontrollable social anxiety,"Hey, I'm a 19 year old male. I was kind of extrovert when I was in high school, that is 2 years back. But I have gotten used to living alone during the lockdowns (I live with my parents but I barely left my room for a long while). This has taken a huge toll on my social skills... I'm not able to talk to new people anymore (if it is one person I don't really panic, but I can't deal with groups of people.) My college classes have been online untill now, so my batch mates meet up often but I keep coming up with reasons to not go..  I have become extremely insecure and I always feel people judge me... I actually started smoking weed to deal with my randomly triggered anxiety attacks and it really helped. But that didn't help with my social anxiety... I can't go to therapy because that would need me to open up to my parents and they aren't the kind who would understand this and even if they did they would get hurt and blame me or themselves and make a pointless argument about it... I am really struggling because everytime I tell yes and then I cancel in the last minute... This happens only with new people, I'm comfortable if it is a group of my old friends... Any suggestions on what I should be doing to improve my situation?"

1265,Anxiety,Worst months in my life (I need help comments)," 

First of all, sorry I'm not english native.

Hi to everyone, I'm 21 years old and going throught the worst shit that happened in my life.  
My life is hell, I have problems since I was a kid because they bullied me, I hated school, i was afraid because of this. But now after years that I finished it (3 years) I got problems with other shits that are draining my life essence. In 2019 I got several and continous sleeping problems and Breathing OCD, that year was tough, but everything got worse this year.

I mean 2020 the year of the pandemic I was better, this year was being fine but in July everything change in my life, my problems were back and I couldn't resist them, I started to go to a therapist, and man it's really hard.

Last 2 months are complicated but the last one, all october was one of a shit month, I feel i'm sick. Maybe you can help, maybe some of you went through this. My emotions are altered as hell, like everything that happens to me is in 100% emotional-sensitive level. I have a terrible breathing OCD, I feel like I'm fighting every minute that pass, but now I'm writting this because I simply CAN'T SLEEP, worst thing i'm afraid of sleeping but I want to sleep (today not even an hour, yesterday 4 hours, before yesterday 5 hours). I feel so lonely that I sleep with my parents even, so tough ´, so complicated maybe some of you can help me.

I can expand my story if you want, thanks, god bless you."

1267,Anxiety,Muscle twitch,"Hello. i have asked the question several times but i am very nervous and scared. I have been struggling with muscle twitching for 1 year now it occurs in any part of my body. in my hands, fingers, buttocks, feet, scalp, sides. Almost everywhere !!! I would add that I struggle with extra anxiety, hypochondria, OCD, panic and dp / dr! I do not take any medication for these. I also do not take sedatives or antidepressants. That's pretty much the problem. I’m afraid something serious brain disease is causing this, I have constant compulsion thoughts about it. I don't want to go to the doctor just with someone like this already, please reassure me!"
1268,Anxiety,it’s not going to last forever. i promise you. bad times don’t last forever and soon you’ll feel better again. you’ll feel whole again. everything’s gonna be alright,
1269,Anxiety,I think I might have anxiety or something similar,"This is the second time I have been resiting for the college entrance exam. Even though I already was admitted to an university that is considered great in which I'm from last year, I still decided to try again and keep on preparing for this years exam because I want to get into med school (the education system here is quite different from the US and they award bachelor's degree in medical science.). Everything was smooth at first, but recently I started to lose concentration or make mistakes like copying the wrong numbers when solving math questions. And things go worse; I now have the problems that I sometimes can't read the lines in the books and I just can't process what the questions are even talking about (I have solved the same questions for like, 7 times before without problem, which makes the situation I am in right now the more frustrating.).
And thinking of this makes my heart rate accelerate and it's hard to breathe. My hands shake when I try to study, and I still can't focus on studying.
I think I've become stupid as I can't solve basic math anymore.
I don't know what to do and I'm really afraid of failing the exam again this year.

Sorry if this gives you a hard time when reading... I'm still learning English."
1270,Anxiety,Ideas/Suggestions to get distracted when you're sad &amp; heart broken?,
1271,Anxiety,advice please,Hello i’m 15 i’m diagnosed with anxiety and depression and im can’t stop thinking about school and obsessing over how to make friends. I’m been at school for 11 weeks and think that if i don’t have friends now that probably make any since it’s too late.  School is the only thing i think about and it’s so suffocating sometimes i just want to relax and not think about school. I was doing so good last week i don’t know what happened. i feel like i won’t know how to live my life and be “normal” again. Right when i wake up i automatically become depressed and sad thinking about how i’m wasting my life and high school years away and how lonely i am. I just want to be happy again
1272,Anxiety,Kinda freaking out,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for god knows how long. On Prozac, buspar, and I have 4 pills of Ativan for when shit hits the fan hard. Lately I’ve not been able to sleep. Tons of tossing and turning, maybe getting 2 hours of sleep here and there.
I got prescribed Ambien for it a couple days ago, but it’s not working at all. If anything, it’s making it worse. I also have trazodone, but idk if I can take them together. That stuff makes me tired the next day too, which is just as bad
I’m just beyond frustrated and on the edge of a panic attack right now. I don’t really know what to do. I haven’t slept in a week. Any advice or help?"
1273,Anxiety,Question,Is it common to depersonalise while having a panic attack?
1274,Anxiety,Does anyone have tips to fall asleep without overthinking / crying?,"Hello everyone, I hope that you are all having a good day. I’ve struggled with this for the last couple of years, and it only happens before sleeping. Every time I get into bed, I start sniffling and overthinking about my entire life and how theres a possibility everything can go wrong or how I messed something up throughout the day. What are some ways to help me break out of this habit so i’m not as nervous when it’s time to sleep?"
1275,Anxiety,Anybody get a feeling that when good things happen to you something bad will happen?,"I have OCD and it fills me with negative thoughts 
Example: something good will go on in my life and it’ll be pretty consistent and my mind tells me it’s too good to be true and something will go wrong. It might be my lack of hope or general distrust in myself and the universe. Idk"

1277,Anxiety,Can I ask you for help to find out which emotion I felt in this situation? Which Need didn't get met here?,"It's concerning a conversation I had with my friend.

He showed me something, and I answered to him:

Me: ""Oh, nice, i saw that in a livestream from (specific person)""
Him: I don't give a fuck about (specific person).

I do understand that someone can get upset about people they don't like. But I know that he likes or feels neutral towards this person. I didn't understand his reaction but I felt really upset and took it personally , so I stopped talking. I can't tell at all which feeling I felt or which need didn't get met in this situation.

Do you may have a hint or an idea what it was?"
1278,Anxiety,I can’t sleep well anymore,"I feel more tired than often and can’t sleep more than 8 hours. After I wake up I feel scared and I start to become very paranoid. My dreams have not anymore nice and strange stories, it’s like living in a psychological horror film. I am so terrified about what happens in my head that I would like to not sleep anymore. I can’t stand to the void after waking up, nor the monsters of my sleep. 
I hope you guys are feeling good in your sleep"
1279,Anxiety,My biggest regret in life,"When I was 19-20 I used to go on the unmoderated Omegle for hours and hours to jerk off for a total of 6 months.I have easily masturbated with over
500-600 women on there. I also used to record every encounter I had on there. It was a habit, as soon as I saw a naked woman I pressed the record button and started masturbating. The worst part
was when on 4-5 instances the girl told me she was 15-16 and my impulsive reaction was to press record because it was a naked person. I was so consumed by hours spent beforehand on the site getting horny that my brain just shut down. Then after 3-4 minutes I would see her face or some other indicator that would make me realise she was actually underage and I would leave the chat, or the girl would leave herself. In both cases I deleted the recording after and never kept any of them. 2 years from that I am seeing a therapist but I still get severe anxiety and depression that no one will forgive me for this and accept me into their lives. I am lost."
1280,Anxiety,Has anyone had this happen,I smoked weed monday and it triggered an anxiety attack. Ive been having these anxiety attacks on and off throughout the day. 2 days ago my sleep has been almost 0. I have not been able to sleep the past 3 days. Im not sure if its because of the weed withdrawal or anxiety. Ive never been through this and im not sure what to do.
1281,Anxiety,Tinnitus (ringing in ears),This issue started the same time my panic attacks started. Now when I’m anxious I get this ringing in both ears. Sometimes when I wake up in the middle of the night it’s like I obsess over it and in total silence it seems so loud.   Is this relates to anxiety?

1283,Anxiety,"Feeling so guilty, anxious and confused need some advice?","Over a month ago I went out with my friend we had a few drinks and decided to go to the nightclub to see what it’s like as i haven’t been clubbing for 3 years. I remember most of the night like when I went to the club and walking home I remember me and my friend talking to these people and I can even remember what the people were wearing and other small details I don’t remember much of the conversations though and I remember me and my friend dancing on our own for a bit and deciding to leave the club early as we felt tired and I felt really bad going out clubbing without my boyfriend. My mum said when I got in I seemed drunk but not overly drunk. I always get scared if I done something bad after drinking as before I use to black out and have done bad things like at the start of me and my boyfriends relationship I blacked out and a boy kissed me and I didn’t pull away, my boyfriend has forgiven me for this but I’m so scared if this happens again and I wouldn’t remember it or suppress the memory of it. My friend said nothing like that happened and we didn’t even speak to any boys but I’m scared if she doesn’t remember either? I keep having these memories of me dancing with someone or hugging them or even kissing but each time the memory changes to a different person and to a different scenario? I can’t sleep or anything in case I did do something and just suppressed the memory? Everyone keeps telling me or my friend would of remembered. I’ve recently been diagnosed for ocd and I’m waiting for therapy and waiting list is 7 months I’m not sure what to do I feel like I’m going crazy and that my boyfriend doesn’t deserve me I have this really bad guilt and keep worrying what if I don’t have ocd what if it’s just an excuse in case I did do something bad what if the memories are connected to something that did happen"
1284,Anxiety,"I'm going to my first rave! Here's how I have prepared, and how I'm strategising for a good time.","I'm 22, and will finally attend my first real rave. I've never even been clubbing, so this is a totally new experience. I've had crippling anxiety since as long as I can remember, really, but now I'm medicated and in my prime!! 

First of all, I'm really really scared. I've already decided to not do any substances I'm unfamiliar with, and to kick my (old but constant) ED thoughts to the curb because not eating will mean hella anxiety and bad times. I want to have fun! I want to not think so hard about what's to come. 

My bag: a staple in my anxiety is prepping. I have a small crossbody bag that looks cool with my Halloween costume that contains all my necessary stuff. 

Contents: Two small candy bars for emergency energy, weed for emergency anxiety attacks, plenty of booze to keep me drunk (I'm a lightweight so I could fit plenty for me) a powerbank + charger cable, bandaids, hand sanitiser, earplugs, a case for my glasses and there's room for my headphones and my phone. I feel a little overpacked but It's necessary for my anxiety, everything is carefully planned for any situation. I just got off my period last week so there's no fear of that since I never bleed mid-cycle. I wanted to pack more things but this is all I could fit + I can't dance with a big bag hahah. 

I'm going with a friend who will NOT babysit me, which I'm a little scared about. He will look out for me ofc, but I'm going in fully dependant on myself. I'm going in costume which I feel very comfortable about, I love dressing up and I love Halloween. 

I'm really scared about making my way home after, but I'm trying not to think too hard about that. I have plenty of money in case I need to take an Uber, and the bus always goes to my station no matter the time. As long as I can get to station X I can always get to my home station, 24/7. As long as I can charge my phone I can find my way home. 

Going home is an issue for future me, and as long as I have my phone and my headphones I feel ""safe"". 

I feel so unhinged when I talk to my friend about my anxiety over this, since he's such a chill, go with the flow dude, so it's nice knowing some people might be able to relate. 

To all my fellow introverts with suppressed inner extroverts, we can do it ❤"
1285,Anxiety,It’s my one year anniversary of getting anxiety from malware,Hey guys. Today is the one year anniversary of my anxiety. This day last year I downloaded a bad malware onto my laptop and every day since then has been hell. I don’t even own a computer anymore but know I can’t help the feeing that whenever I use one I’m going to get a virus. I’ve tried to get help multiple times but most of the responses are “Just get a good anti virus” or “just reboot windows”. None of those help because even if my computer had no sign of a virus I will still be very paranoid. I know there’s other people going through this and I try reaching out and most don’t respond. I just want to get past this. This has been the worst year of my life and I don’t think it’s gonna get better. Until next year guys!
1286,Anxiety,Guy trouble,"So this is something that’s been on my mind for a bit. I matched with this guy on Tinder I went to HS with. We didn’t talk, more just vaguely recognized each other. He seems sweet, but I don’t know if he means it or not. We cuddled and he asked for every little thing he did (first time we hung out). He wanted to kiss me, but I declined since I wasn’t planning on it being a intimate visit anyways. He just invited me over to chill while I was sick. I also told him a bit how I’d lost one of my siblings not too long ago, so I don’t know if that’s a red flag? Sometimes I also feel like texting-wise he just tries to cut it off with a lol or something. He did invite me to something again, but I just said maybe because it’s outside and it’s getting chilly. I do genuinely like his personality and I feel like we vibed, but please let me know if any of this sounds weird! I just don’t wanna rush in blind and get hurt. Either way, I will be careful. If it’s been a few months and I’m confident, I might be open to more. But right now, I’m just not there yet."

Does anyone else find that they live in a constant state of anxiety about the potential of getting an anxiety-induced stomach ache? This has been my life for the past few months and I haaaaate it.

One of my anxiety's favorite forms of manifestation is stomach aches, as I'm sure many can relate to. But these days I find myself getting SO worked up over the thought of getting a stomach ache. How debilitating it can be, how I'll be down for the count for hours, the potential it has to ruin my plans. I wind up giving myself a stomach ache about it! Self-fulfilling prophecy 😞"

I’ve dealt with varying levels of insomnia and I seem to constantly being on alert and my mind constantly finding something, anything to worry about.  It’s worse when I don’t have something to reasonably worry about.  I tried medication once but the side effects seemed to be as bad as the anxiety.  I’ve also had counseling in the past, but I tend to think of my anxiety as a medical and genetic issue.  A few years ago I was feeling better with regular exercise and better eating habits — and feeling positive about my future — but now because of constant stress and poor sleep I’m so tired and have muscles and joints aching that it’s hard to exercise regularly and cut back on junk food.  What has helped other people in a similar situation?"
1291,Anxiety,How long does it take for EMDR to work?,I saw some disturbing images and I was recommended EMDR therapy. My question is: how long does it take to work?

1295,Anxiety,SCARED FOR TOMORROW CANT SLEEP,"Tomorrow is my appointment with my neuro ophthalmologist for my eyes. To see why my eyes are dimming basically I pass all the test and they didn't know the cause of my dimming of the vision but my left pupil has rapd basically when your pupil doesn't respond to light properly. They diagnosed me with optic neuropathy I had dimming on my left eye for 8 months and recently it got worse. I'm expecting the worst case scenario and it makes me cry uncontrollable I'm saying your going blind. Or u have a disease that's not treatable.

1296,Anxiety,Advice?,
1297,Anxiety,I (27M) am feeling overwhelmed by anxiety right now.,"I am still working full-time, my medical school wants me in the UK by Monday.

I had put off moving over but now my anxiety has built up to very physical signs. I'm fidgety, my heart rate shoots up.

I'm anxious about the whole ordeal. First time I went, my then gf broke up with me. It got really ugly.

Second time I tried, I had a panic attack and teared up at the airport.

Third time around, my now gf looks unsure of us too. She might break off. I'm really worried about moving and being broken. My anxiety finds something new to be worried about.

I'm currently at work and I am almost about to lose it. I'm shaking, I feel faint... I had my session with my psychologist last night, it helped while we spoke, but now I'm back to square one feeling like shit and borderline suicidal thoughts are flowing again."
1298,Anxiety,Advice?,"Hi! Kind of new to this, but am in need of some advice. First off, I’m an 18 year old introvert who suffers from severe anxiety. I am in my first semester of college and have been planning on transferring to a university (that is out of state) in Fall of 2022. I am afraid of how my mom would react to my decision as she always has made a big deal over a lot of things and make it a big problem. Which I never understood why, but I developed a fear of talking through things with her cause of it. Does anyone have an idea on how I can bring the topic up and just talk to her? (Without her making it a problem and inducing a panic attack out of me)"
1299,Anxiety,there's just noway to meet ppl anymore,"i have both physical and mental illness but loneliness is the real killer. holiday season is coming up and i don't wanna be in isolation feeling depressed. Halloween, thanksgiving, Christmas, and it's already cold, dark, rainy in PNW. can't meet ppl"
1300,Anxiety,You ever just breathe wrong and feel like everything comes crashing down?,"I’m not in too bad shape right now, but this has been a trend for a long time for me, so I was wondering if other people felt this way. I still get like this every now and then, so I just figured I’d ask what’s up with it"
1301,Anxiety,My presentation is less than 24 hours away…I’m petrified,"Currently having an intense anxiety attack. I just feel so scared. Probably the scariest I’ve ever felt. It’s embarassing because I only have to speak for 1-2 minutes but honestly it’s going to feel like hours the moment I step in front of the classroom. I’m so scared. I want to say “I can do it” but I’m so scared I’m shaking right now and I don’t have to even present until tomorrow afternoon. It’s not fair that I have to be so scared of something that’s not even a threat . I realize that my classmates are probably anxious too, and just want to get it over with. But me, I am probably overthinking this but I’m still scared. I have been dreading this day since Monday started and now it’s here. And I can’t take the fear. I feel like I could faint right now writing this just thinking about this. This is all I wanted to say I should probably get through this anxiety attack first"
1302,Anxiety,What can i do for my girlfriend,"My girlfriend has anxiety. She has panic attacks almost everyday. I always support her but i wanna do something more. We are in different cities. I say i can go to her but she says ""it isn't necessary my family is with me"". I feel sorry for her i wanna do something for her to feel better. What can i do for her to feel better?"
1303,Anxiety,I hate being so sensitive to noise dude,"I’m the type of person(due to my ADHD) where if an unwanted noise, even the buzzing of a light that no one else could hear WILL nearly put me into panic mode. I’ve been this way since a kid, and it honestly sucks. My mind can’t think of anything else but the damn noise. 

My upstairs neighbor can’t walk quietly for shit and there’s always some random bangs at nearly 1-3AM. It gives me so much anxiety, I’m losing my mind."
1304,Anxiety,Anxiety induced dizziness?,"Hey all. I’ve been dealing with unexplained dizziness for the past three (3) years now and it’s been bothering my health anxious mind. I’ve gotten countless tests done, ruling out vertigo and neurological problems . I’ve gotten heart and blood tests done and everything has come back normal. It’s gotten to the point where my dizziness goes on pretty much all day with only maybe an hour or two of relief. It comes on randomly and suddenly so I’ve always had a hard time correlating it to just being anxiety but could my unexplained dizziness daily just be anxiety? I don’t necessarily feel anxious before having these episodes but when they do come on, it does trigger my anxiety response. It also happens when I sit in certain positions. 

Getting a second opinion from a neurologist in November but wanted to ask is anyone on here has experienced this kind of dizziness daily (feeling like you’re off balance and walking on a cloud or feeling like certain parts of your body are loving when they aren’t) due to anxiety? 

Do meds help? Any advice? I do in fact feel like I’m going a little crazy here with how much I’ve done to try and figure out what this is and not getting anywhere really."
1305,Anxiety,Public speaking/presenting in front of people,"I have to present in front of my class tomorrow, and then I have two presentations next week as well. I only have to speak for around 5 minutes per project, but even that is way too long for my anxious brain. Even though I know the material, and I present great in front of my friends, I forget everything and look like a stupid stuttering idiot tripping over my words and forgetting my train of thought when I’m actually up in front of people. Can’t wait to spend the rest of the class period after I present crying in the bathroom. I’m so fucking nervous, and next week is gonna be even worse."
1306,Anxiety,I’m struggling with the thought I need medication to be “normal”. And the me before medication wasn’t good enough.,"When I was 6 I first went to the dermatologist, when I was 7 I started getting bullied, and by 8 I was on acne medication. All I knew is it wasn’t normal to be so young taking medication (and getting acne before puberty) and since that core memory I have always struggled with the relationship between me and medication. It has always been something negative. I’ve since grown and have recently started taking SSRIs to combat my anxiety. My boyfriend and I agree there has been much improvement but as he lists all the things different about me, I can’t help but feel the me before medication, the authentic me, was not good enough. I did not realize how much of an effect my anxiety had on others. And while I know my medication is a good thing, it makes me feel like I need this pill to be normal, and without it I am not normal. It makes me feel ashamed and the person I was before was tolerated. Everyone is celebrating this “new” better me and while I admit I like this new me, it makes me feel like the person I was before was not good enough. And I must rely on this pill or else I will become the person that isn’t celebrated and is not good enough and simply tolerated. It makes me really sad and it’s something I think of when I take my medication every day. I don’t know how to change the relationship I have with me and my medication."
1307,Anxiety,What do you do during an active panic attack? Is there anything that stops a panic attack in its tracks? Please help,"I’m anticipating another bad panic attack because I had one last night. I know it’s irrational. It’s a vicious cycle. I’m trying to remain calm but it feels like I have absolutely no control over my mind or body. Absolutely none. 

I had a severe panic attack last night, seemingly randomly, like they always are. Most of the time I feel like nothing triggers them. I was fine and then all of a sudden couldn’t breathe. Felt like my breathing suddenly got too slow and too shallow. Felt like I was just gonna stop breathing at any moment. And then came the racing heart. My heart rate was crazy high. For some reason my first instinct is to jump up and run out of my house. I always think cold, fresh air will help but it rarely does. And then I drank a liter of water. Don’t know why I think that’ll help. 

I felt so sedated and like I was gonna lose consciousness at any minute and fought my body from going to sleep because I was scared i’d never wake up. My heartbeat felt too weak at one point. I ended up falling asleep against my will 5 hours later but I was in hell for those 5 hours. 

Most of the time I would end up driving myself to the ER in case this is the one time my life is genuinely in danger but I forced myself to not do that. At the ER they’d give me something like Ativan and i’d immediately calm down and be okay. But I can’t keep doing this. And I don’t have any benzos at home. I just need help. What can I do to stop lingering anxiety? To stop a panic attack from progressing? Anything I can take that’s easily accessible without a prescription? Any new remedies/substances that anyone’s had success with? I will literally try anything. Breathing exercises and meditation do not help at all. In fact, focusing on my breathing causes me to panic even worse. 

I’m miserable and so damn tired of living in fear that I might have another random episode. I just wish there was a way I could prevent it from happening in the first place. I can’t call off work again. Help :("
1308,Anxiety,Contacting a Therapist (for my Friend),"I have a friend who’s definitely interested in therapy, but the only thing that’s been stopping her for the past 2 years is sending the first few emails. No matter how much encouragement I gave her, and even when I would help draft it with her, due to her really bad social anxiety, she could never send it.

Now again, she says she wants to see a therapist really badly, but the email is the only thing getting in the way.

Can I send the initial email on her behalf, and then direct the therapist to contact my friend afterwards for a follow up? How would I explain that in the email? What would I write in the email if I’m doing it on my friend’s behalf?

Any advice is appreciated."
1309,Anxiety,Anxiety,"Have medicine exams in few hours, and just now my brother found out my relationship with blades.
Great!"
1310,Anxiety,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,Why the fuck do I have to feel like this
1311,Anxiety,Where would i go for therapy/diagnosis,I originally found this sub because i couldnt sleep cause i was manually breathing. Now i think that I may have untreated ocd and/or anxiety for the past 2-3 years. Where would I go tor treatment. Should I go to my school counsellor?
1312,Anxiety,How do you deal with perfectionist individuals,"Hi so I’m just curious how do you place yourself from these certain types of people. 

Currently I have a huge anxiety disorder and to top it all of I have depression too. The people I always work with are really goal oriented and would always want the best output from each other. In the past I can keep up with their pace but due to how the pandemic has affected us, the rapid decline of my mental health has also affected my work. I’m not saying my outputs are bad but they’re mediocre at best and because of this they tend to ask me to change my output (which in all honesty is fine and the right thing to do) but what I just don’t like about them is how they always call me out when I submit an output and my anxiety, when they call me out, rises making me incapable of communicating properly with them.

how can I keep up with these people? 

I’m also reluctant to tell them of my situation for they might not understand it and I’m really not comfortable in telling anyone about this actually."
1313,Anxiety,Failing at work,"A few month ago I start a new account at my job. I was told it was going to be a challenge and I was already feeling really bored with the work that I was doing at the time. I did the stupid thing and just said ""yes"" to the new account and didn't even really go in depth with what was gonna happen. At my work there are countless stories of people getting put into new positions they know nothing about and being able to work themselves out of it. My supervisor keeps telling me to ask for help if I need it but if I asked every time I needed help I wouldn't get anything done. Now I am in such whole and work is super backed up. Now I leave my work with the worst anxiety that I can barely get anything done after work, all I do is just lay in bet and thin about the next day. For about a month now I have just wanted to quite, but I am scared of the social / professional implication of leaving when things are in bad place because of me. There are times that I get light headed and just space out due to the anxiety that I am in. I know that I quite now it wouldn't be that bad, and I could live of saving for 6 months to a year easily. I spend most of my day cursing to myself and saying ""I can't do this any more"""
1314,Anxiety,Never been this bad,Basically during this past year I’ve been diagnosed with many different things I was diagnosed with Bpd but I also suffer greatly from extreme extreme anxiety and paranoia that’s to the point where I will call my friends and constantly ask them if they think someone is trying to kill or harm me or if I’m in a certain situation where I feel like I might be in the slightest bit of trouble I will have a mass panic attacks I will lay down in my room in the comfort and safety of it and midway through a show I will think of some thing and send myself into a never ending spiral of fear I have lost trust in people in general and I’ve come to believe that everyone I’m not already friends with eventually will hurt me My anxiety began to spiral further when I got into an argument with two girls I was friends with at one point and one of the girls threatened to harm me it’s some thing that I’m sure it happens to everyone but even to this day I still get very scared that one day they’ll text me again and will start some thing up again or that they’ll one day randomly just want to hurt me even though both of the girls are blocked and I’ve clearly stated that they are over the situation my mind will never stop I feel like I never get a moment of rest and sometimes my anxiety causes suicidal thoughts because I feel like I can’t live with this constant fear I just want to feel safe or at least be brave my anxiety has ruined my self image causing me to see myself as well for lack of a word a pussy and it makes me constantly get angry and frustrated with myself because I have no other choice but to sit and wait until I’m able to think myself out of the attack my friends always try to help me when I asked them and called them about things they try their best to reassure me but it happens more than they know I just wonder how I can get this under control so I can live normally
1315,Anxiety,I push everyone away from me and I have no one but myself to blame for it,"I dont know when it started. Initially, it was a feeling like ""well we haven't talked for a while so I dont know if it's weird or not for me to wish them a happy birthday"". 

Then it went to messages. I would have friends, where we haven't talked in a month or two, reach out to me. I would be busy at the time or make up excuses and say ""oh ill reply later."" So I leave the message there for a bit to reply. Then a day passes by. I get nervous every time I think about the message. So I dont reply. A week passes by and it just gets worse. Then they message again, wondering where I am. I get scared because if I reply to this one, they know I've read the other message and I just haven't replied. Or im scared they'll be mad at me. Or I'm just scared to have a conversation with them.

This started with one person but this year, I started doing it to more people. Even at one point, I got too nervous to reply to my landlords or even thank them for being nice after I left. I havent been able to tell anyone because I'm so mad and embarrassed at myself for it. 

I have a friend's paintings sitting in my room that I was supposed to return a month ago but I am too scared to message her about it or even think about it.

Recently, my old high-school created a group chat to meet up at our university. I havent looked at the messages because for some reason I'm scared. I don't want to meet up with them, catch up and have to pretend like I know what I'm doing with myself. I'm a failure and I don't want to end up feeling exhausted after faking a smile around everyone.

I am in therapy. Haven't mentioned this yet but I will. I'm just so tired of conversation feeling like it's a giant hurdle every time."
1316,Anxiety,Keep your room cold,"This is a big help for me: cold room and good blankets. Something about the warmth and safety of a bed and pile of blankets contrasting the cold air really helps calm me, especially with morning/middle of the night/wake up anxiety. I keep my windows open as often as possible. Would highly recommend."
1317,Anxiety,Why is my social anxiety so bad all of a sudden,"Could it be possible that everyone around me actually hates me? Or that they think I’m stupid or worthless?? Or is this just my social anxiety, idk what to think 😅"
1318,Anxiety,anxiety worse at night. tips on falling asleep?,"i’ve noticed that my anxiety gets about 10x worse at night time. it feels like my body is constantly “buzzing,” feels like i can’t breathe correctly and my chest hurts. i think part of the reason is because i have health anxiety and i always get freaked out that somethings going to happen to me in my sleep. i toss and turn constantly before being able to fall asleep. i also get weird adrenaline rushes in my chest when i start dozing off. 

does anyone else have this issue? any tips on how to fall asleep quicker or to stop these adrenaline rushes?

usually i count backwards from 100 every night when i’m trying to pass out to distract my mind and it works sometimes, but would like some other options"

1321,Anxiety,Propranolol,"I have been taking 20mg of Propranolol daily for the past three months to help with the alleviation of the physical symptoms I deal with from anxiety. It has truly been a life-saver. I was wondering if anybody else takes this medication for anxiety, and if so, how many mg/daily dosage? I am planning on talking to my doctor soon about eventually getting off of it, as my anxiety levels have come down significantly. Any info would help, thanks!!"
1322,Anxiety,can i still develop self esteem/confidence even if i don’t live up to my own standards because it doesn’t feel possible,"the reason why i hate myself is because i feel like i’m not good at doing things properly, perfectionism i literally base my worth depending on how good i am with things. like i expect myself to be perfect at almost everything, every hobby, every sport anything u could thing of. how can i just accept myself for not being a perfect human being because it’s really hard. I also hate myself because i’m very socially anxious and i never really defend myself so i just see my self as a loser because i can’t stand up for myself or say things i really wanna say to someone, i think also because i assume people think i’m a loser for being so shy and not talking?? I’m bad at explaining things sorry but my low confidence has ruined my life and nothing seems to help, affirmations just make me cringe 10x more"
1323,Anxiety,I don’t know anymore,"I just don’t even know what I’m feeling right now, social anxiety? Anxiety? Depression?

It’s just like I have no motivation to go with my friends anymore, and when I’m with them I’m acting so much different right now. I can’t feel normal in the conversation, I can’t be relaxed while talking to someone and I can’t just actually laugh at what people are saying. Idk why but it feels like I never even know what to say in the conversation. Over the past month I finally got happy, I would do random little stuff and talk to myself and hum and dance. Now I don’t do any of that, it’s just try to act normal around friends, stress, try to do school. I don’t even know what my problem is. I just started college, this is supposed to be the best time of my life and only specifically right now, this is the worst I have felt in so long. 

My anxiety used to always just be me being insecure about the way I look, that’s it. Now it feels like it switches everyday, worrying about how I look some days, but others I’m just super on edge all day, maybe from school. Then some days like today I feel like it’s either social anxiety or depression where for some reason I just can’t be or feel normal whatever I do

There’s like a pit in my stomach that won’t go away, it feels like it holds me back from being happy and relaxed 

I actually don’t know what to do anymore"
1324,Anxiety,I have my first job interview today!,"I have my very first job interview today. After a call with the CEO of the company, he called me again and set a time and date to have a personal interview today.
Six years ago, I would have never believed I would be able to do this. It's been a long road and I'm starting to see the way out, today is a good day.

We need to have hope, I'm sure better days are ahead of us all. Keep trying!"
1325,Anxiety,Scared I’m losing my mind,"I have a fear of going crazy and the last few days I’ve felt really not with it, I also have the same 5 seconds of different songs going round in my head which I cannot stop. Help :("
1326,Anxiety,Throwing up every morning?,"Due to overwhelming wake-up anxiety. Has always been an issue for me but has never been *this* bad.

I also can barely eat. 

This can’t be good for my physical health. Is this common? I’m so exhausted."
1327,Anxiety,I have a fear of being recognized,"I really want to make music, videos and stream and a lot other stuff that I think would be fun however I have a fear that is stopping me from doing any of that and it's the fear someone I know will recognize me. The reason why I have this fear is because I think that if people that I know like ex girlfriends, old friends, family who I haven't seen or spoken to in years will try to exploit me or try to damage me for example I wouldn't put it past any of them to make something up and use facebook messages out of context to prove their point but I no longer have a facebook account since 2017-2018 so if I wanted to defend myself it would just be my word vs their ""evidence"" and I know everyone would believe the out of context messages because even through it's out of context they would at least have something to prove their point other than just their word. I know it's a stupid thing to worry but whenever I want to make music or a video this fear just hits me like a brick wall prevents me from doing what I want to do and I don't know what to do to combat the fear to get over it."
1328,Anxiety,Afraid to feel happy,"I just got my first apartment, job and a girlfriend in like three months and I know that I should feel really Happy and lucky that I have ended up in this situation. But I am so afraid of feeling Happy because if something bad happens, it wont feel as bad if I have been expecting it already. If I let myself feel Happy and something bad happens it will feel even worse. And I feel like something bad will be happening because so much good has happened in the past months. I have GAD diagnosed."
1329,Anxiety,Severe Anxiety Symptoms,"Before I start this, this is in no way representing others with severe anxiety or anxiety in general, everyone has it differently, and I’m not reprimanding them or making them less, I’m simply sharing my story.

Adding onto that, this post also isn’t to belittle other’s problems, everyone’s problems are valid, you deserve help.

This also is to say that these symptoms are not always anxiety, please check with a doctor. 

So, with that out of the way, my story starts when a stomach virus hit me in 8th grade, I think, hard to tell. I was severely nauseous and was not able to move or eat anything. What was bad, is that I had to go on a trip to New Mexico with my family that week, and there was no way I could stay home by myself. I tried to move but every time I felt so sick and I started to have panic attacks. We tried medication, for the trip, from nausea medication, which did nothing, to allergy medication, which made my heart race. Then, the day came that we had to leave. My mom has to be in the backseat of the car with me while I cried and had to fall asleep to get away from the extreme nausea and extreme heart racing. By this time, I hadn’t eaten anything for a week, so my parents were desperately trying to get me to eat, but all I could stomach was fruit drinks. We got to the hotel, and the whole trip was ruined for everyone by me being bedridden in a hotel room. The only thing that kept me sane was sleep and playing Animal Crossing.  Fast forwards and we finally got home, from there, I wasn’t able to go to school, I was barely able to eat (my weight dropped to 80), I wasn’t able to move, for months, I took so many blood tests and went to so many doctors and tried everything, until my mom finally convinced me that maybe I could try anxiety medication, since my doctor was recommending it so much. I tried, and started feel better slowly, I was able to walk. Got on another medication, and the nausea was gone. I was able to move and go back to school, eating hasn’t been easy, I’m not at the weight I want to be at all, but at least I’m not dangerously underweight. It’s all a work and progress to get to my best, even though it’s been 3 years, I still can’t eat like I normally could and I have panic attacks when I feel nauseous in fear that it’ll come back, but, I’m trying."
1330,Anxiety,[Advice needed]how to reduce stress? its getting all over me and i cant study one bit due to it. I end up procrastinating,"I am preparing for job interviews and got quite some rejection in the interview, i thought it all went good by still i failed and since then i am not able to focus at all."
1331,Anxiety,I'm losing it,"Yesterday has had to be one of the worst days of my life so far. On Saturday I moved out of my parents house to live at university halls, which I have being planning to start for a year now. The first day there I though I was doing okay and was trying to stay positive to try and enjoy it. The day after I woke up with butterflies in my stomach that lasted for about an hour until I calmed down, but later on during the day I was overwhelmed with thoughts and began having a panic attack. The Tuesday followed a similar pattern as I had my first lecture which I found difficult as I couldn't understand the task at hand and another student called me stupid. Then Yesterday was supposed to be a day for me to try and chillout and focus on my mental health, but something inside of me changed and just couldn't stop crying. Yesterday was the first day I believed that I would be better off dead then face these difficult challenges as I panicked and tried to ask for help where many were turning me away.

I'm now back at home with my parents and am thinking about quitting the university I'm going to do open university where I can study at home as I don't like working with other people and my parents can keep an eye on me.

I feel like an utter failure because I let things get on top of me and have decided to quit. To be honest I'm scared everyday and worry about my future as I can't go to new places without my parents and my anxiety and depression is out of control.

I need some serious help, I just want to be happy."
1332,Anxiety,My anxiety is going insane right now.,"I did take a new drug, it’s def enhancing how I feel but this happens regardless. Do you think these are signs of mania?? I talk alottt more than I would like to, I am indecisive and contradicting, I am very clingy and feel extra lonely, attempted suicide yesterday, my sex drive is destroyed because I don’t believe anyone can love me forreal. I can’t stress enough about the constant chatter in my head (negative and positive battling it out) insomnia and this horrible feeling like something bad is going to happen and I’m just waiting. Does anyone have anxiety or manic symptoms they can recognize?"

1334,Anxiety,Health Anxiety And Worrying About A Nose Disease (M20),"For the past two years on and off I’ve had 3 periods of some really debilitating health anxiety. It started off after I got a septoplasty, which is where they fix your deviated septum. Before the surgery I read up online about a disease called empty nose syndrome. It was a real scary disease that a lot of people end up committing suicide from because of the symptoms it leaves u with. The disease is rare but looking it up it said it’s possible to get it a few years later, which is even more rare in its own. Most people that get it later will get it a year later or so but they’ll have weird symptoms right after surgery. I Talked to the doctor because I was so scared of that disease and he told me that he’s going to make sure I don’t get it which made me feel good at the time. 



To make this story shorter basically I just did a bunch of research and looked at the people who talked about the disease and they’re experiences etc. After this happened I had some anxiety but not much. Well since then Anytime I have a traumatic event or feeling this health anxiety comes back.  The most recent being the breakup of me and my girlfriend. She was so so so important to me and we dated for quite a long time. I remember after doing it I had just a giant fucking panic attack, one of my worst if not the worst.  Since then my Breathing has felt weird. Feels like I can’t breathe correctly through my nose and i end up breathing through my mouth and my chest is all tight and it just gets worse. It’s like my body becomes hyper focused on my nose and feels every sensation etc. Now i’ve dealt with this two other times yet I still am able to feel convinced i’m getting it.



I know the disease is rare and i know  it’s even more rare to get the disease unannounced years later but I still can’t shake the thought it’s awful. Just typing this out so feel like I can’t breathe and my throat feels tight and etc. It’s just awful because one of the symptoms of that ENS is feeling like u cant breathe but the reason for that is because the air in their nose feels to open with no resistance or it hurts to breathe or they can’t feel the air at all like they’re drowning in some way etc. I cant have this happen a third time it’s so damn awful."
1335,Anxiety,Friends?,"When you go to school/work or even wondering in home, do you guys have need to have/make friends?

I might be asking myself, buuut- I said to myself that I don't need them, and then I question myself about it and IT always ends up that I need them.

It's just sad because of my shyness or lack of confidence I can't get up to making new friends at all.."
1336,Anxiety,Seasonal affective disorder,its that time of year . some years arent so bad but some years are the devil . this year is already starting with physical illness . thankfully i feel much better at night once i taken my meds and settled with a nice video to relax . i hate it . has anyone elses symptoms have already started ? i havent dealt with symptoms this bad since 2015 i know calming tea works wonders i have actually decided to cut caffine and smoking since it is better for overall health . what are your remedies for SAD ?
1337,Anxiety,My little brother asked me for help with his homework,"This might seem pretty small but this last year has been really bad for me. Im on sick leave for at least the rest of the year and even then I dont have a job to go back to from what it looks like now. Basically feeling pretty useless. All i do is sit at home and go to treatments. 

But today my little brother asked me for help on his homework in sociology! I have a university degree in science of social work so this is right up my alley. It just made me so, so happy. Its the small things I guess."
1338,Anxiety,Advice on antidepressants,My doctor said i can take Celexa in the morning and then amitriptyline at night to help with sleep and tension headaches. I thought your not meant to take 2 antidepressants.
1339,Anxiety,How do you know you’re having an attack?,"This is the first time I’m experiencing this and I don’t know if I’m really having an episode or it’s just panic and all in my head.

What happened before was I got lost in my own thought because of some triggers that makes worried sick, then I can feel my heartbeat and my hands shake terribly and my vision narrowed.

This happened a few weeks ago but now I just keep asking myself did it really happen or I’m just overreacting? Or worse, maybe I want it to happen? I just feel like I can’t trust my own judgement."
1340,Anxiety,"Wow, I didn’t know about this subreddit, thanks to those who welcome me","I decided to join this subreddit because although I don’t suffer from particular diseases I am a person who likes to see things in their place and that in difficult situations can panic, for example if I am alone in facing a problem.

So I’d like to tell you when something comes to mind and especially help those in need.

Thanks again for the welcome, a hug."
1341,Anxiety,Is this anxiety or Rejection sensitive dysphoria? I can’t even live a normal life,"Hey guys, I am having a really tough time with my anxiety now. Always gets worse for me at the end of the year I’m not sure why. 

I am deathly afraid of any confrontation, so I let so much of shit slide. Basically I just ignore or act like something doesn’t affect me when it doesn’t. 

I remember last year I was sitting in my car, turned off and the guy next to me slammed his door against my car. I was so pissed and angry but I was too scared to confront him or say anything. After the “altercation” with me not doing anything, this anger brews in myself that I can’t even defend myself or my loved ones in the future if I am always like this, and that anger makes me so angry at the small stuff too. 

I tend to get very angry and worked up nowadays if I sense even the slightest sarcasm or attitude or anything besides 100% sweet and kind interactions which I expect for some reason. I can’t take any rude behaviour or any interaction that seems half arsed. 

I get so damn angry and depressed over the way I am being treated, and then I get depressed and angry over the fact that I am too scared to do or say anything about it, and the voice at the back of my mind says I’m not a man or I’m not normal. 

Has anyone else experienced this kind of mental torture? 

I am unable to do normal stuff people my age do because I fear these intersections and the subsequent internalised reaction my brain goes though. 

I need to apply for a job now as I’ve just graduated but I can’t seem to apply as I’m too afraid to get rejected for the job and destroy my already absent self esteem in addition to being afraid of the interactions that I would have to go though from the interview and during my job too

I am just a shell of a person now 

And I hope this issue is not forever. I have tried therapy but I couldn’t even do the tasks I was given because it was too hard for me to do, and that was just to call and talk to my friends over the phone, which I don’t do too"
1342,Anxiety,Long term success for dealing with anxiety,"Like many anxiety has stole time away from my life. Months in fact, and I think I've seen it at it's very worst and I don't want that to happen ever again.

A change I will make is to make time to do things which help my anxiety every day, ESPECIALLY on the days where I'm NOT feeling anxious.

This is something I've neglected to do. When things are going my way I'll ride the wave rather than take stock of the situation and not get carried away.

So daily I want to take things easy, practise yoga, do breathing exercises, take more baths and walks (alone time!), eat less crap.

Hopefully that way I'm best equipped to deal with anxiety when it rears its ugly head next!"

1344,Anxiety,Not to mention love !,"I am a girl (18f) and really not sure that I love a boy or not. But I have just wanted to Time pass with him and really did it. 
But recently I heard that he is going to be married. Now I am become crazy by thinking that I can't time pass with him anymore. And he will not pay attention to me anymore.

And I want to back his attention to me. 

I didn't say about my love to him and he has not done it also."
1345,Anxiety,i hate it when teachers ask me questions in classes,"i have never any idea whats going on even though i look at them and listen to every word and i think they can tell that and i remember like 10 years ago a college professor who would just lecture and never really ask any questions and he just looked at me and asked me a question i had no idea and it just really makes me angry and same with this yoga class she does one of those ""what does yoga mean to you?"" BS questions where everyone has a corny answer and i cant answer a question like that i hate i life so much"
1346,Anxiety,"I don't think I've had problems with Anxiety before, but I'm pretty i have depression, im not diagnosed. I recently started getting sudden anxiety attacks while in school. I don't want people near me. Is this an anxiety attack or something else?","Hello. It's quite common for me to feel uncomfortable about being physically close to someone, but i never really noticed it as a repeating problem, my instincts just solved it. By that I mean I would just leave the room when i feel a bit uncomfy. But on Monday I felt really uncomfortable while in class, i Just wanted to be alone, i hugged myself, went into the fetus position, and was just constantly moving away when someone walked near me. I really feared getting touched and really wanted distance. It was the first time this happened and i ended up just crying and shaking until it passed. Right now I'm experiencing the same, i really don't want anyone around me, but my friends are aware of this now and I'm more prepared so I don't expect it to get as bad as it did on Monday. I just flinched because my class mate moved their arm and they're within reach of me. I really do not want to be touched and I fear it a  lot at the moment. I wouldn't say I have social anxiety as I feel quite comfy with new people but atm I really just want to get away from everyone."
1347,Anxiety,Little inconveniences can ruin my mental health for days and i don't now why? I am the only one?,"I've been feeling really depressed and anxious for the past week or so. I truly feel awful and i am always on the verge f crying because i have that much stress.
I always feel like this when a minor inconvenience  happens in my life and it throws me right into a worrying-overthinking-spiral that i cannot escape. Especially if i don't have the any control over these situations. 
For example, my bf's wisdom teeth need to be removed in 2 weeks and for some reason i have been a total mess since i knew. I really don't know why but i just can't stop worrying about things that could go wrong and i don't want to see him in pain. I know it sounds ridiculous but my anxious brain is making such a big thing out of it. I've had 3 panic attacks in the last few days just because i cannot get it out of my head. It makes me feel weak and ashamed tbh 😅
It's not that big of a deal and what about people who actually are dealing with much greater issues and worries? What must they think of me...
And If i can't handle this then what if something really major happens in the future? It makes me even more afraid, like if my bf ever got in a serious accident i would just die i guess. Is this even normal? Am i the only one? 
And how do i deal with these feelings? I know my thoughts are irrational but my feelings are still real. His surgery isn't for two more weeks but i don't want to feel like this for two more weeks. 
I also don't think that is the only reason why i am feeling so shitty but that was the triggering event i guess. 
Anyway, words of advice are highly appreciated &lt;3"
1348,Anxiety,Brain zaps when angry/scared,"Hi all,

So I've experienced brain zaps before, when I've been coming off of antidepressants or missed doses but I'm currently on antidepressants and I haven't missed any doses.

Yesterday when I returned home, I noticed that the back garden gate was open which isn't possible because its bolt locked.

When I saw this, my body instantly starting having zaps up and down my body. I know that I had a rush of adrenaline, but when I turned my head or heard a noise or was coming around a corner, my whole body shocked from my brain to my feet. It was absolutely awful. It didn't feel like a normal fear response, like I said there was zaps up and down my body, it felt like the jerks you get when you're falling asleep and your body jolts.

Does this happen to anyone else when they're faced with a scary situation or threat?"
1349,Anxiety,I miss when I used to not experience anxiety/stress,"I didn't really experience real anxiety or stress until I was like 19. I had a good upbringing with no traumatic incidents and had parents who were very lax, so I feel like there was literally nothing for me to care about. I had no concept of the future or responsibility. I remember my best friend had anxiety and I couldn't even comprehend what that meant and when my friends would talk about how stressed they were I'd be like ""why? just stop caring?"".

Then when I was 19 I moved to a city and started living alone and had to get a job of course. I feel like the reality of life hit me all at once and since then (I'm 23 now) it's never been the same. It's been particularly bad the past couple years. I can't smoke weed anymore cause I have panic attacks every time. I've not been drinking very much for months cause it sends me into an unbearable depression &amp; gives me anxiety.

I just miss how stress free my life used to. Sometimes I think back to how my brain used to think about thinks and process stuff and I wish I could go back to bring able to think the same way and not think so much about everything. Bums me out sometimes. Feels like this is just life now and I'm gonna have to live with this forever and I won't ever get back to the way it used to be.

In a way I'm grateful that I at least got to experience those 19 anxiety free years, but I just want it back so bad."
1350,Anxiety,My anxiety gets so bad I can’t even focus on reading,"I can’t focus on anything, eat, drink, sleep. I try to read something and this horrible feeling comes over me of complete sadness and like something bad is going to happen. I am so desperate for someone to talk to I don’t even understand it 🥺"
1351,Anxiety,Nice combination of anxiety and ADD,"Yeah, so. Imma tell you. I have this nice combination of anxiety and add and all my life, my parents and teachers got/get super mad at me, because I forgot to do something they told me 5 minutes, or even 30 seconds ago and I get super anxious about it and in the end of the day I feel like I'm gonna colapse xddd 
But most of the time Its just this funny ""I...wanted to say something...I forgot what it was...oh my god...wtf did I want to...Aaaaaaaaa....AAAAAAA"" and it actually makes some people laugh, so I don't mind it that much xddd But yeah, it's a fun combination that I wasn't aware of until recently, when my friend pointed out that I show all the symptoms of ADD and she was right it seems xddd

So yeah, just wanted to tell this to y'all, hope you have a nice day and remember, that I love you all!"
1352,Anxiety,Please help me with my survey about travelling and mental health habits,[removed]
1353,Anxiety,is this an extreme reaction?,"I took my first sertraline pill last night at 7pm. 50mg.
This morning I randomly woke up around 2am to the most intense panic attack of my life. I was so stressed and anxious she heard me say ""I want to die"" loudly as a way to expell what I was feeling from me.

I've spent the morning hyper ventilating, legs weak with a migraine and an intense weight in my chest. I called the doctor who said this should go away after a few days, but my family is concerned for me.

Here's the thing, I don't have anxiety all the time, I only get it in certain situations where my life isn't going well, yesterday I was feeling great, and this morning I feel worse than I've ever felt in a long time.

My family said I shouldn't take any more medication,  I'm inclined to agree, I have studies to complete and this is getting in the way. Right now I'm laying in bed trying to insulate myself from how cold I feel, I'm thinking all the worst thoughts about myself whereas yesterday I was fine. 

What should I do? This is much more intense than I was expecting"
1354,Anxiety,My brain never shuts down,"Hey everyone,

So, my (21f) biggest problem in life is that Im never comfortable at doing anything. Even when im in the most perfect scenario, with people i really like and without nothing to worry, my brain is still stressing and being anxious for some reason. 

Even when im smashing drunk, my brain is still going on and on about why i shouldnt be there or why everyone around hates me (and im pretty sure they dont).

Whatever the circumstance is, I overthink every small thing. I just want to be in peace for a second so I can enjoy life, but i cant do it as much as i try"
1355,Anxiety,Anxiety avoidance,"I'm suffering anxiety and my SSRIs finally started working, I feel normal again and able to keep up with my daily tasks. Except one thing, I really cannot push myself into stuff I love doing. I draw, and I'm also pursuing masters degree at Academy of Fine arts. Drawing is a must for me and also my biggest passion. But ever since my panic disorder and anxiety kicked in, I've been avoiding it to the point I cannot even be in the same room as my working tech (I'm a digital artist). I push myself everyday, but only after couple of minutes drawing something I'd otherwise enjoy, I start getting nauseous and my heart is going crazy. At this point I'm literally doing everything else beside that, I read, clean, and interact with friends and my partner, but cannot get myself to engage with my real passion. Does anyone has thoughs on that? :)"
1356,Anxiety,General anxiety,"I'd like to say that most days my anxiety is under control, or low. But then there are those days where EVERYTHING makes me a worried wreck. 

Right now I'm stressing myself out over a Dj-gig I have together with a friend in three weeks.  Yesterday my brain also decided to remember a few stupid things the bf told me years back, which makes me feel insecure today for some reason. 

Never mind why, right? It doesn't really matter what it is, the anxiety pops up regardless how small or insignificant. 

I'm just not quite sure what to do with it. What do you guys do? Do you shut yourself off from the world for the evening and just try to stabilize? I tried to meditate, but yeah, still sitting here with anxiety. 

""This too shall pass"", I just get so angry at my brain when it does this. What could possibly be the purpose of grabbing onto one of the few mean things the bf has told me during our 8 years and obsess about it? (I'm sure he didn't mean for it to be mean, hes a good guy. Its just another example of a mind obsessing about some random thing in the past really.) And I KNOW the gig will be fun, just got to suffer through the three weeks of agony beforehand? Fucking sucks."
1357,Anxiety,My first meds have started to kick in this week.,"I was told beforehand that they are likely to make things worse before they make them better, so this isn’t a surprise. But I’m now on my third consecutive sick day from work staying underneath my covers because I can’t handle thinking about anything else. I’m freaking out and I hate it."
1358,Anxiety,Moving from a high-rise to a freehold and it's causing me so much anxiety. Has anyone else experienced this? I get nervous at the idea of living on the ground and feel so vulnerable. Everytime I see the new house my brain distorts.,
1359,Anxiety,I can’t leave the house,"My anxiety has been so horrible this week. I had to quit therapy b/c I found out my Medicare type doesn’t cover it. I thought it would be a smooth transition but I’ve never felt so much horrible anxiety. That and other factors of life are making me so anxious to the point where I can’t leave my house. I can’t go to school because the thought of being anywhere that isn’t my house sets me off. This morning I was crying and hyperventilating because I was about to leave the house and walk to the bus stop but I felt paralyzed. Like even the thought of touching the door handle scared me. I know it’s my brain making the world seem scarier than it is and I know it’s irrational but I can’t. I can’t explain it well. I can’t imagine existing outside the world I’ve already made for myself inside home. My dad asked what I was wrong he was practically begging me to tell him what was wrong but I couldn’t tell him. I, myself, can’t even pinpoint it. I’ve missed school yesterday and im missing today as well . I feel pathetic. I feel burnt out to where I don’t even want to speak. I feel horrible."
1360,Anxiety,Body acting weird,Literally 3 minutes ago I was about to sleep then all the sudden my legs randomly started to feel weird. Like electricity was running through them. And I feel a weird needle like pain on my feet. That sensation lasted for about 10 seconds. The needle pain happened twice. It’s scary to me. Yesterday I had an okay day so now after this happened I’m feeling like I’ll just be anxious for the next couple days.  It’s 5:42am for me now.  I have health anxiety so anything weird happening in my body I automatically think I have something wrong with me.  I’m very scared it’s something bad. I also am scared of doctors.  I’m just scared 🥺🥺🥺 why are my legs feeling weird. Imma cry
1361,Anxiety,Anxiety induced insomnia,"My anxiety started in in August and has progressively gotten worse. I always feel a rush of adrenaline in my chest when lying down. Now, I've been told I suffer from depression as well. My sleep disturbances started late August waking up a few times but able to go back to sleep. a couple of weeks ago I having trouble falling asleep. When I start to doze off my body would experience hypnic jerks and I would jolt awake. I would end up staying awake the whole night. I am unable to nap. I use a sleep aid so I can sleep and function during the day. I meditate daily, practice living in the present, exercise. Nothing seems to help.

My doctor prescribed Lexapro to treat my anxiety and depression. Would the insomnia subside if I can get my anxiety ad depression under control? Or do I need to see a sleep specialist?"
1362,Anxiety,Dizziness,Does anyone else get dizzy? And does it come on before anxiety?? Or during??
1363,Anxiety,Constant anxiety has made me look different almost sick.,"I don't know if anyone else suffers from this. But I will look in the mirror on some days and think 'geez you look like your dying' I've lost weight these last few months (not underweight) and I think I look paler....

My weight just shocks me cause I haven't been this weight in almost 4 years! And I'm already super pale to begin with, and I haven't been going outside ever... 

BUT my anxiety is a bitch and when I'm looking at myself, it repeatedly tells me 'your dying. Google it I bet it will tell you the same thing'

And it makes me even more anxious when my family randomly shows up at my house and all I can worry about is 'oh god they are going to think something serious is wrong with me' (which they never do. They always tell me I look the same lol) 

I just wish for a break. A normal day would be wonderful."
1364,Anxiety,Throwing up due to overwhelming anxiety.,"I’m 18 years old. For the last 9 months I’ve woken up in a shear panic attack that would last for a few hours if I was lucky. Within the time I wake up to when it’s over, I sit on the bathroom floor and violently throw up. I’m balling my eyes out, not wanting to be here, not wanting to continue on with it. I can’t breathe or talk, and I’ve been getting help. I was put through c-pep a month ago and shit just doesn’t get better. I’m finally trying to open up again, meet someone new. And I have, in fact I’m supposed to be seeing her tmr and stay the night. But all I fucking do when I think about it is throw up. Which makes no sense considering I want this more than anything. It’s completely ruining my life and I just need someone else, who also vomits from too much of one feeling to just help me out. Please tell me something I don’t know. I’m just exhausted.."
1365,Anxiety,Fuck extrasystoles.,That's all.
1366,Anxiety,Scared to take medicine,Hey everybody! I went to my doctor on Monday and he gave me some etifoxine (stresam) to take mornings and evenings to help with my anxiety. Once I got home I started researching this on the internet and I've read a lot about how it doesn't do much and gave people very bad (and quite dangerous) effects. Now I'm scared to try it in case it makes me sick. What should I do?

Hyperacidity and acid reflux runs down in my family both sides and I have it too. I also suffer from anxiety and panic attacks. Can this be caused by anxiety or acid reflux? I also had been in an anxious situation a while ago. 

Any tips or techniques to get rid of this sensation?"
1371,Anxiety,I can not do this anymore.,"This physical pain. It's like there's a boulder on my chest. There is a knot in my stomach. I don't know how to make it go away, I'm so exhausted. I can't cry. I have forgotten how to breathe properly. I can't, I just can't anymore."
1372,Anxiety,Climate anxiety is very much real to me,"I'm a 22 year old from Brazil, have been diagnosed with anxiety when i was 15 and i take medicine for it. The last year or so i've been struggling with climate anxiety, which is something most people don't take seriously or maybe ignore it because they can't change and fix it, i'm not sure. But i've seen my mental health decline loads in the last months due to it. 

Every single time i see a dead wild animal, bees for example, i feel actual sadness and deep anxiety. When i turn on the TV and watch news about wildfires in my country (caused by people) i feel so angry and frustrated, and i cry. Sometimes my day is completely ruined by climate news and i can't endure seeing wild animals dying (not domestic animals, i mean actual forest animals). Around may this year, a biome called Pantanal in my country was severely devastaded by wildfires and everyday i would cry knowing i could do nothing about it, i feel powerless and so much frustration.   
Can someone here relate to me? I don't want to read people saying ""well thats the world now lets end capitalism"" because even tho i agree, that is not something i can actually do and it's not going to help my anxiety unless capitalism ends tomorrow, you know? I know there is no easy solution for my feelings but i would like to hear from people who feel the same."

Seems to get worse because before it was only over social situations and now it’s over random stuff"
1378,Anxiety,Should I be concerned about Wellbutrin?,My dr wants to add Wellbutrin to my already existing Zoloft. I know this is a popular combo but she mentioned something about it lowering the seizure threshold and I’m scared to take it now. I’ve never had a seizure but I’m afraid I might if I take it.
1379,Anxiety,My coworkers are making me self conscious without meaning to.,"I think because of them speaking a lot on my appearance I'm getting more stand-off-ish. I don't know what to do because I genuinely don't mind them wanting to give me advice or voicing their opinions but it's making dread this job more or even just hate looking at myself more. I'm beginning to get a little nasty too as a defense mechanism and I know that's horrible. Their hearts are in the right place, maybe? I hate being so overly freaking sensing and having no real people skills."
1380,Anxiety,Finally had a breakthrough about my thoughts for almost two weeks: I was ruminating,"Hi! A few months ago (like three), I finally accepted that I have anxiety after a two years of being in psychiatric treatment for suicidal thoughts (which I left behind, thank you very much) and after a lifetime of feeling sad and overwhelmed with life. It was quite liberating and realizing that thoughts are jyst thoughts, that they aren't real, lifter another weight off of me.

The thing is, like every overthinking anxious person, since last Monday I was thinking over and over, worriee about the songs that cross my mind, about memories that appear when something in the present reminds me of a past memory. It started making me feel terrible, especially because I had already felt that way a previous week. Meditating yesterday, I realized I had gotten scared of my thoughts and of feeling anxiety. And on, and on I went analyzing my thoughts (you can guess where I'm going with this).

So, a few minutes ago I read [this](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alicegwalton/2014/08/19/7-science-backed-ways-to-get-out-of-your-head/?sh=12a1beef3273) article and ugh, I finally realized that what I've been doing all these days is RUMINATING over my thoughts. I was so in my head trying and trying to manage them that it became an obsession and made me feel terrible and anxious. I already knew about rumination, but I thought it was about thinking about a specific problem, but I realize it is about analyzing your thoughts too, how and why you think things. I guess, thinking too much over stuff it's damaging and in this case, it really was.

Today, I'm going to see my psychologist so I'm going to tell her about all this. I hope that this breakthrough can finally help me feel calm after almost two weeks of terrible anxiety. At least, right now my heart isn't racing or palpitating, and I'm feeling calm. Wish me luck for the rest of the day. Thank you for reading my story 💕"
1381,Anxiety,Wish me luck guys im really scared,Currently at my neuro ophthalmologist appointment bc of my optic neuropathy I'm scared right now that they had to calm me down I calm down a little bit but a still anxious as other said on here that it's probably diabetic related I hope their treatment bc I don't wanna go blind.
1382,Anxiety,OCD vs GAD?,"

I’m struggling to differentiate these, they share a lot of similarities. I overthink every little thing and constantly stress 24/7 even I have things under control. It’s been causing headaches and neck pain a lot because I stress so much and my head feels dizzy. I worry a lot about finances, my health, family even though I know everything is under control I just can’t stop these ruminating thoughts. I’ll spend hours “researching” things on google until I’m satisfied with the results, then I’ll just do the same thing the next day. I can never relax, I’m always stuck in my own mind. I can’t enjoy time with my family and friends I’ll just sit on the couch for hours with these obsessive thoughts and every time I’m away from home I’ll get extremely anxious because I can’t look up these things. Please if you have any feedback I’d love to hear it. I can’t take much more of this."
1383,Anxiety,Never ending oanic,"I get panic attacks when I’m alone—like  blind hysterical panic and it doesn’t end til I find people. I’ve tried meds and therapy for years but I still can’t do stuff like driving in rural areas w no quick access to ppl via shopping centers or whatever. 

Im afraid I’ll never be able to live alone and that if I do find myself alone and panicking it’ll reach the point of zero thinking ability, just running from panic thru the woods. 

I’m exhausted and feel stupid and ridiculous but it’s so far beyond anxiety attacks, jsut full on flight response w no thinking"
1384,Anxiety,Suggestions for anxiety regimes,"I have PTSD as well as depression/anxiety. I take 300mg venlafaxine, 20 busprione, 10 mirtazapine daily as well as clonazepam daily. They used to get me through but everyday at the moment is a massive struggle. It's a huge wait to get in to see my psychiatrist so I have to make do with my gp. Does anyone out there know of any medication I can suggest to my doctor that might help?
I go to therapy weekly and have plenty of tools to help but they aren't cutting it at the moment"
1385,Anxiety,Just received an official diagnosis today of anxiety.,"Essentially, I have been an individual with some form of anxiety throughout life. Attributing it to my dad's anxious personality and parenting methods (Partly). Well after coming down with some severe COVID my doctor is saying I have some form of anxiety that is manifesting in panic attacks.


I've been just browsing new jobs and applying. Every once in a while I see the disability waiver that you have to sign. With anxiety being on there. I'm curious if anyone has said yes to that and what the outcome has been?"
1386,Anxiety,Any of you have bouts of excessively needing to clean the house but it never feels clean and it’s just really upsetting for some reason,Makes me not wanna try. Then it gets worse. Then I feel worse. Fuckkk. Why do I care. I never have people over here anyways.
1387,Anxiety,Is this anxiety?,"When I’m around people especially in crowded hallways I feel like I can’t breathe. My throat feels like cement and it starts getting really tight and feels like I’m suffocating. At first I thought this was claustrophobia, but i’m coming to realize I get this in situations other then in crowded places.  Like I usually spend most of my days at the library in my school bc I have a weird schedule and have a lot of time to kill, and sometimes these girls will sit at my table with me and I start getting the feeling again. I start freaking out a bit because I know I need to keep my breathing down or they’ll think I’m weird so that kind of gets added onto everything. Sometimes ill even be in a vacant hallway and I’ll see one of my teachers/coaches and get the same feeling. I’ve had this happen to me ever since I was in middle school (maybe even a little in elementary school.) I also have a whole weird thing with eye contact, like I don’t really know how to keep it. When someone looks at me my first instinct is to look away, and I usually don’t know how long I should be looking at them when I talk to them."

1390,Anxiety,"Silent Anxiety? No panic, but debilitating tension in chest"," Hey Guys. Any advice would be appreciated. Since my early 20s I have had some sort of anxiety. It started as mostly panic attacks. I'm 40 now. I have figured out how to suppress the panic attacks over the years and the worst I get now is edginess with a slightly elevated heartbeat. I don't love it but I can live with it. Recently I haven't had the edginess but my body has been having issues.

Generally my body is tense. I get pain in my neck and shoulders, chest, and joints. Recently I have been having a tightness in my chest making it hard to take full breaths. I have also been having on and off lung pain. The lung pain is like when I jog in the cold and the cold air hurts my lungs. Been going to the doc and we thought it was GERD. I have been on meds for that for several months now (PPIs). Heartburn has been better but lung issue and tightness are still there. Doc sent me to gastro doc, gastro doc says this isn't GERD, go to pulmonologist. Likely it's a lung issue. It's going to be several weeks before I see the pulmonologist. Reading around online it appears like this could all be anxiety. Docs don't think I have any huge issues as I am in reasonable health otherwise.

For stress I have been trying to walk, run, and exercise often. And I am eating healthier. This has had the opposite effect. The other day I took the dog for a hike and I could hardly breath, it wasn't asthma, I just couldn't open up my chest to get a breath. I was surprisingly not panicked and just tried to calm down. I had to get home and sit for a half hour before it mostly passed. I have been experimenting with tryptophan to try and relax and I have seen some good results. The first time I took it I told my wife, ""I can breathe"". But it has started to work less and when I upped the dosage I started getting bad headaches. The lung pain and chest tightness generally happen when I drive, exert my body, and later in the day. Caffeine and alcohol relieve the issue, but I hate using either as a crutch.

I really hate dealing with this and I hate that being healthy makes it worse. Generally exercise really helps my anxiety but in this case it makes my issue worse. I would love to hear any successes any of you have had with a similar issue. I have a very busy life running a business and have young children. Oh, and in my 20s the only med that seemed to help my anxiety was Paxil. It had terrible side effects and I vowed never to take it again. Getting off of it was terrible too."
1391,Anxiety,Conspiracy theories are literally causing so much anxiety/ Tik Toks algorithm sucks.,"Ah okay so with tik tok and YouTube shorts I sometimes stumble across conspiracy theories. I usually don't care about them, I find them interesting and just go on with my day. 

Well yesterday I stumbled upon one that relates to me specifically and I'm freaking out. Apparently I have Sanpaku eyes(my iris doesnt touch the bottom) and a lot of people think that's a sign of a curse/ early death. So here I am sitting in the library at school freaking out about my impending death.. and to make things worse death has always been a big cause of anxiety for me in general(I literally slept in the living room for half a year because I was afraid I'd die while sleeping and nobody would see me in my room thats away from all the other bedrooms)and now it's worse.. I know this is a a fake theory but just seeing all ths ""evidence"" of people with these eyes is just freaking me out. I've always been an anxious person but now I'm just in a constant paranoid state. 

So in conclusion, I hate tik tok and I hate people who make these videos. And I hate anxiety."
1392,Anxiety,"I want to travel so much, but anxiety is getting in the way","I've traveled a lot and I consider it a significant part of my life and it's all i want to do. But anxiety is a feature of every trip i go on. It's gotten so bad that I've bailed on a good few trips now, most recently today. I'm feeling a little demoralized as i come to terms with the fact that i might struggle to do the thing I love forever.

My anxiety is caused by the fear of being anxious. I'm anxious about being abroad and not being able to calm myself down because I'm away from my familiar settings. It's especially bad after COVID.

I'd just like to know that there's hope for me, before COVID i was planning a trip to central Asia for a few months and today I bailed on a short trip to France"
1393,Anxiety,Anxiety that people dislike me,"I have constant fear and anxiety of people disliking me, even strangers. It’s to the point where I get anxious to drive or go to the grocery store because I feel like I’m going to piss someone off. When someone does dislike me and treat me badly because of it, I start obsessing over it. Sometimes it’s the first thing that I think about when I wake up in the morning. I feel like I’m constantly going around in a circle of anxiety and it’s also causing a great deal of depression. When I think about the fact that I will always have to deal with people, especially for my future career, I feel hopeless. Idk if others have dealt with this, but some advice or encouragement would be appreciated as I am currently feeling really down."
1394,Anxiety,Throat feels like it's closing off and feels tight,"My throat feeling likes closing off and feel like I can't burp as though it's trapped in my throat and feel like my air way is closing off. I suffer from anxiety , I had a ENT scope and throat was normal recently , I had a barium study one year and doctor said mild reflux my doctor said it's due to the anxiety. He gave me medication but stopped it on and off due to side effects and now I'm worried my esophagus narrowed from all the year long acid reflux asked my doctor for another barium swallow he said no need for one that highly unlikely. But I have anxiety and always worry, even experience dizziness etc and worry. Now I got a tooth infection and when swallow the pills it feels like it's stuck in my throat and won't go down , can anxiety causing all this ?"

1396,Anxiety,I feel like I am a failure,"I feel like I am a failure. I have been off my anti depressants and anxiety meds for awhile (insurance problem) and it is getting to me. It’s getting progressively worse. I am having the worst time sleeping.

My boyfriend keeps telling me how amazing I am for doing the things I do but I don’t feel like it. I feel like I suck."
1397,Anxiety,Late and night and I’m very anxious about a lot of things.,"Super anxious and it’s late at night. Worrying about how much sleep I’ll get, if I even get enough. Worrying about a presentation I have to give this week. Worrying about future job plans and graduating. Worrying about what people think of me. Worrying about saying stupid things. Worrying about if I’ll be productive enough tomorrow. The list goes on. This mental chaos feels unending and exhausting sometimes. 

I just want to be held and loved. I feel like I don’t deserve it sometimes though. It’s been a mentally long few days. I needed to get this out."
1398,Anxiety,I cannot sit with my own thoughts.,"I just want my brain to stop flipping out for no reason. My agoraphobia is getting bad again, to the point I can barely leave my house anymore without a panic attack.

I lost my job almost exactly one year ago due to Covid and I'm tired of the only outing being a trip to the grocery store (where I inevitably have a panic episode). I spent so long working on myself, through therapy, medication and exposure therapy and I feel like I'm back at square one. That job forced me into a routine and exposures and it's all gone. My therapist retired and I think I need a medicine switch or something. I'm afraid to see a new therapist and I am 100% not about to go work in this total COVID nightmare world.  

 I don't want to start over again. I am so exhausted of living with horrible, intrusive thoughts from my OCD. Coupled with my awful fear of leaving my home...even though I'm going crazy in my own home...it is just too much. I just want the constant anxiety and panic to STOP.  It always feels like the world is ending and I'm just so freaking EXHAUSTED of waking up to repeat the same thing."

1402,Anxiety,Why i can't stop to feel miserable?,"I have a lovely family

I have a stable economy

I was studying

I know I'm pretty

I had friends 


And I can't stop feeling miserable. When I was a child girl I was fat and ugly, I fought against my body believing that when I was pretty my bitterness would end.

I thought it was my reason for life, but maybe it was just a trick of mine to divert my attention from everything else.

Now I do it more out of inertia, sometimes diets and the gym are the only things that make me stop thinking. Other times, even though I know I have to look pretty, I can't see myself like that, somehow I feel that looking pretty is just an illusion of mine and everyone else sees me as I did years ago.

A few months good, other months bad. I am fed up and I feel selfish, I know that many people really have things to suffer, many of them even acquaintances of mine."
1403,Anxiety,withdrawal or just anxiety?,"hi, i’ve been taking 100mg of zoloft for the past 4 months and up until now my anxiety and depression have been pretty much gone, until last week when i ran out of medication and didn’t end up taking my dose for that day until the next morning(i usually take my doses at night). i’ve also had a lot of changes going on recently with my girlfriend and brother moving to college(she’s only 25 minutes away) and summer ending. i’m wondering if this sudden relapse in anxiety and depression could be from me missing a day of medication last week or if it’s just all these changes making my anxiety bad?"
1404,Anxiety,Started 100mg of Zoloft today,"So I have posted my Zoloft journey here before, but I want to give an update/insight. I have officially been on zoloft for 3 weeks (25mg&gt;50mg&gt;100mg). My dosage was increased today which I’m really excited about! Before starting medication, I did so much research on side effects because I was so nervous about them. I had almost slim to none side effects after 3 weeks. My anxiety if anything felt suppressed, I had slight confusion, and very minor headaches. It has genuinely made me the happiest I have been in a while. I definitely still feel anxious sometimes but I know that it takes time to kick in. It could be all mental at this point, but everything is going great with it!"
1405,Anxiety,Can’t sleep,I’ve had my eyes closed for 2 hours and I can’t sleep and I’m getting fuc*ing pissed off. I feel like the only thing that will help me is chugging a beer to make me drowsy.

1406,Anxiety,cyclobenzaprine with my citalopram,I'm taking 10 mg of Citalopram before bed. Doctor gave me some cyclobenzaprine 10 mg to take at bedtime for excruciating neck pain. Should I only take half a dose of the cyclo?
1407,Anxiety,Did college give you PTSD?,"I’m starting grad-school today, I wanted to. 
However, my undergrad was a roller coaster ride. Although I wish no one else had to go through a similar feeling, if you have, I’d appreciate any and all advice! I don’t want to let the anxiety take over and/or permeate into other aspects of my life, which I’m afraid it will.
PS. I’m not on any medication (yet)."
1408,Anxiety,I’m in a very frightening situation and it is affecting my sleep,"I was sexually assaulted at work by a client several months ago and I did not tell anyone about it out of embarrassment and extreme anxiety. The client recently was suspended for a month from my business for sexually harassing another coworker of mine recently. He is no longer suspended and has been making jokes about why he was gone for a month to other clients. Saying “oh it was an implication” or “oh you know, people are making up rumors”. 

He recently triggered me while I was working last week by making jokes about why he was gone, not saying it was for the sexual harassment but because it was a big misunderstanding and it was my coworker’s fault. It got me so upset because I didn’t have the courage to talk about what he did to me and my coworker no longer works with me because of the situation. I ended up sobbing in the bathroom while at work and told my managers about what happened. 

Now I have to write in a written statement to my manager about everything that happened that moment he assaulted me and I have to turn it in tomorrow morning. I am so anxious I want to throw up and not go to work tomorrow.  I feel humiliated and exposed. I wish this wasn’t happening to me. I refrained from saying anything earlier to my manager because I hate being part of any high stress situation. Especially one like this."

Every morning i wake up with a racing heart and then followed by being anxious. I easily get worry because i am too concern about my health. I've been like this for 4 years, i always think like I'm about to die, I'm so afraid of everything, even being alone,  i feel disabled, i feel fogged in my head, i feel restless, i feel useless, hopeless, i stopped my school because i am too afraid with panicking on public, i don't know, i feel like surrendering is the answer 😔 i feel down."
1411,Anxiety,Am I a bad person?,"I was such a terrible little kid. I used to hit my mom and scream at her at the top of my lungs. When I was a teenager I was prescribed adderall, xanax, and klonopin and I became a total monster. I would say things to my parents that I would never even consider saying to other people. My mom has struggled her whole life with the same kind of anxiety that I do, which makes how I acted even worse. Over the last 10 years I've tried to apologize in different ways, but I can't seem to forgive myself for what I did and said to them. I decided a while back to get off of benzos because I wound up in the psychiatric ward at HCMC (Hennepin County Medical Center). They also made it hard to feel anything which made me even more callous. I caused my parents so much pain. It's really eating me up and I have a really hard time forgiving myself for what I said. I know that I'm not a bad person, but when I get mad I say and do things that are reprehensible. I just wish I could figure it all out. I just want to know if there are other people out there that feel like I do."
1412,Anxiety,Fear of fire alarm,"Hi everyone,
I am a 22 year person with autism and I have had a fear of fire alarms ever since I was a kid. I was able to manage the fear somewhat growing up but this morning my apartment had a fire alarm test and I didn't get a chance to evacuate the building before it happened so you can guess that I was startled. 
When I hear a fire alarm, the shock is so intense that I end up being paralyzed by fear and cannot move which is a problem because in a real situation I wouldn't be able to escape a building should it happen. The problem isn't as bad when I am around other people (like at school) but I live alone. 
Sadly I am too afraid to even turn off the lights and sleep in my own bed as the fire alarm is in the bedroom too. 
It seems pathetic to me that as an adult I still have this fear but I have no idea how to remove my anxiety. 
Anyone have any advice on what I should do?"

1415,Anxiety,"DAE ever feel like they are ""competing"" with others to be the most mentally ill?","I'm very ashamed of having these thoughts but I mentally do this all the time. I constantly compare my mental health struggles to others and tend to only be able to validate my mental health struggles in comparison - this ends up translating as feeling like I must be the most ""mentally ill"" for my struggle to be valid and it's not just me being lazy or whiny. When I hear about my friends who have far worst mental health problems than me yet don't seem to focus on it very much, I feel a huge amount of shame. Even knowing that struggling with mental illness is common (most people seem to in different degrees) brings me greater shame. 

I think a lot of this comes down to my own ability to be forgiving of myself. I used to constantly live in a place of feeling like I was lazy and useless before I realized I was depressed/anxious. I still invalidate myself a lot, which seems common. When I think ""Oh, this is normal. They are experiencing the same thing,"" I go back to that place of shame and realize I don't have an ""excuse"" anymore. I can't get out of it without feeling like I desperately need an exemption to not feel ashamed AKA I am a special case. Separately, I also compulsively seek validation that I am even ""mentally ill"" (e.g. regularly taking screenings for diagnoses despite being diagnosed, wondering if I actually went through trauma, constantly writing about symptoms). I think I actually want to feel special. I hate myself for it. 

It's just sad. I don't want to be that person who always has to be the sickest to feel okay. It does an injustice to how I see other people and how I see myself. It's objectively stupid. I am very supportive of other people when I hear of their struggles with MI but they often sound so much worst than mine - it often makes me feel so weak. Especially because most of them outwardly appear to be moving forward yet I feel totally paralyzed. It's frustrating and it feels like I'm being toxic.

I can't seem to find that middle ground of realizing a) everyone's experience is totally individual and therefore incomparable and b) everyone's struggle is valid. Just because someone objectively suffers more doesn't mean you need to suffer because you're luckier.

I apologize if this sounds tone deaf. I know it's a dumb way to think and it's kind of insulting to everyone that does struggle with mental illness. But I do think this on a regular basis, I'm really frustrated by it, I want to know if other people struggle with these thoughts too."
1416,Anxiety,"Loud thumping heartbeat and feeling a ""buzzing"" sensation which is hard to explain.","I'm 27M, when I was a kid probably Age 9 I was very shy to be in a position where there would be any focus on me. But as i got older it started getting worse and I became very scared of being put in a focus spot. 

For example, I couldn't read or sing in front of the class. I would have these panic attacks which I'm just realizing that they were panic attacks as I get older, but they were terrifying. My heartbeat would raise so high that I could hear it, everything had a buzzing or vibrating sensation where I would just freeze after just saying or singing more than 10 words in front of a group.

I am now better, I can take on medium size groups around 10 to 15 people. But I still can't do large groups like a wedding of my brother where I would have loved to give a speech but couldn't. And it breaks my heart.

I wish people around me understood that. But I was also not in a first world country back then. People didn't think that it could be a sign of anxiety. Even I understood it years later. 

I'm hoping if there is any  person reading this knows a child who they feel is going through something like this but can't describe it, please get them help.

And if you are someone who is going through this, please seek support."

Fast forward to now, the last few weeks the symptoms have returned, but manifesting itself in heart racing or, what sort of feels like skipping. No pain.

The love of my life has just disappeared on me. I also have M.E. which is the icing on the cake really. I'm just rotting away in my mum's house. I don't see friends and have lost many. I will never find a partner again if I DID want to, nor be able to move out again. I'm just a burden on everyone. If I'm not in chronic pain or too fatigued to move, I'm disabled with panic and BPD.

(I do have GAD, but this has been the source of my worries as of late). I am constantly learning about different types of cancer and life threatening diseases and honestly feel most concern for my parents (as they are older than me) but also myself. I am honestly starting to get confused about why everyone else isnt constantly worrying or freaking out about this stuff as well. It’s terrifying that often times, cancer isn’t diagnosed unless there are symptoms in which case it can be too late for the patient. The thought of losing my parents is something i truly can’t handle and these thoughts are starting to interfere with my life. How do you all cope? or how do you keep yourself protected against these things?"
1423,Anxiety,Is this a symptom of anxiety,"Hey all! 
Wanted to reach out and ask this question because apparently it’s not normal. I definitely have anxiety. Definitely notice it pretty often throughout my every day life. Currently being treated for it with therapy and medication. 
Now that that’s out-of-the-way, there is this thing that I do sometimes that doesn’t really make sense to me and nothing is really coming up when I Google it. When I have sore muscles, I will definitely enjoy rolling them out, the weird part is I will do it to the point where it’s really painful and has even caused bruising. I definitely have noticed this behavior with certain types of pain. I mean obviously pushing on bruises hurts, and I don’t really do that but recently I got my tongue pierced and I had a cut in my mouth and I kept pushing on the cut with the piercing and obviously it’s just inflamed the area. 
It’s kind of just sometimes when I have areas that have dull pain, I’ll just press on them until the area hurts way more. I’m not sure why I do it but friends have definitely told me that it’s weird and slightly concerning. 
Wondering if anyone else does this or knows of what this is.

I turned 18 a couple months back, and I’ve been wanting to move out because I don’t want to be that guy that lives in his moms basement. It hurts though. When I told my mom what I was thinking I saw all the happiness drain from her face because she had been planning things to make it nicer down there, and I’m scared of hurting her even more and I don’t know what to do.

1429,Anxiety,My efforts to be there for someone were rejected and made me super anxious,"My partner and I both have depression and anxiety and we are struggling to manage it.  We keep triggering each other and find it really difficult to pull it back when that happens.  Both person believes their own story and is hurt the other person doesn't see their perspective. The back and forth effort to communicate and the hurt it causes the other can mean we get stuck in a funk an all day.

So this morning my partner was very down and depressed.  Covid restrictions and being unable to do life as planned has been getting to him A LOT.  I was trying to cheer him up or help him or just be there for him, I was asking him what he needed and what I could do for him - could I make him something to eat? could we talk about some positives in life? or perhaps he just needed some space?  He just kept shrugging me off, telling me he wasn't hungry, snapping at me - nothing I was doing was working.

This made me anxious.  I could feel it coming on. I feel helpless and like all my efforts are worth nothing - there's nothing I can do can help him.  I was trying to be positive and upbeat and he wasn't taking it well. I have been trying to be mindful of my anxiety and I kept telling myself I was doing all the right things, he just wasn't responding favourably.   I felt tight in the chest and unable to move on, I decided to talk to him about my anxious feelings, I said ""You are just moping around all day with your shoulders slumped and sighing loudly, it's giving me anxiety as despite my best efforts, I just can't cheer you up.""  

Well, that caused him to blow up, I tried to reassure him that my intentions are good and I just want to be there for him, there's no need for this drama, I love him etc etc etc, just grasping for something but we was so worked up I had to leave the house. 

He then messaged me accusing me of mocking him, attacking him for being mentally ill, that as a person that is meant to be supporting him I was torching him.  He told me that I was being manic and crazy and lying to myself about helping him.  No no no, I'm just trying to help I say.  He tells me I'm bulldozing him, that I think I'm being calm and loving but I'm actually being defensive and aggressive.  WTF this kind of talk makes my anxiety even worse!

I came home and he's in bed keeping away from me.  It's now the evening and this has gone on all  day.  I'm so tired of this and I just don't know what to do :("
1430,Anxiety,Anxiety or Covid?,"So I just had the weirdest experience. For starters, I felt kind of shitty earlier tonight (stuffy nose like allergies, increased heart rate, stomach pain) so I took 1000 mg of vitamin c thinking I might be coming down with something… potentially covid. As I was getting ready for bed, I started to feel my heart rate increase even more and my feet were clammy. Suddenly, as I’m laying in bed, my body starts to shake. I wasn’t sure whether I definitely had covid or having an anxiety attack because when I got vaccinated the only symptom I had after was body shakes/chills. I put in a hoodie &amp; some socks, took half a Xanax, and after roughly 15 minutes I felt better.

So, I guess my question is, has anyone here who has had covid felt similar symptoms? I hate that the symptoms for covid and anxiety are so similar!"
1431,Anxiety,Can BFS symptoms be “triggered? through anxiety?,"Like something brings back bad memories, or of a major fear of yours that you never reconciled with. Or if you see something that triggers you. I only get BFS when I think of such things. But I also have anxiety. So everyone keeps telling me it’s my anxiety. But here’s what I keep trying to tell everybody but nobody understands or just doesn’t listen. 

I know I’ve always had anxiety. I’ve had it since I was little. But whenever I was scared of stuff like Spiderman, I got usual panic attacks. No BFS symptoms. Only now, when I think of things that fear me like a specific phobia, do I get there BFS symptoms. However I don’t even realize that I’m scared of them. If I was never scared of them I would never come to the conclusion that this is anxiety related. It’s always when this stuff gets mentioned that I have BFS symptoms. And I don’t get any sinking feeling in my stomach all my heart beating. It’s like someone mentions it and I instantly feel pins, major itches, spasms, numbness and all the rest. How does this work? I’ve been trying to find an answer for so long and this keeps me up at night"

1434,Anxiety,Looking for some advice how to handle this college dorm situation🥲,"I’m fr the most anxious person in the entire world. I moved into my college dorm yesterday afternoon. And so far it has been both the worst and best thing that’s ever happened to me. I met so many great people and have been really blessed with a good roommate. However, my current dorm situation is freaking me out. This is the second night in a row that I can’t sleep. First of all my dorm has 28 floors. 28 FLOORS. I’m on the 12th floor. I have a fear of heights and claustrophobia. Am I literally the dumbest person in the whole world? Second night that I’m currently shaking in bed crying silently having panic attack after panic attack. I can’t look out the window because it makes me physically sick. Every time I go into the elevator I start to have a panic attack. I actually hate my dorm so much. Also being in a dorm is LOUD. And obnoxious. I’m trying not to be a big baby because it’s only been two days but for how much I pay to live in these dorms and feel unhappy is absolutely ridiculous. All the dorm buildings on campus have 20+ floors. So my only option is to email my RA and see if I can get moved to a lower floor (will I even feel better?) or I literally have to drop out. What do I do! Currently second night in a row that I’m wide awake at 3:43 am."
1435,Anxiety,Starting school again,"Heya- I'm Alex and I'm starting school again after getting so panicked about eighth grade that I technically quit. I ended up passing (out of pity I think) and I'm in a much more smaller school so it doesn't look too overwhelming. My problem is that I just heard about this school and I'm already going to go tomorrow! I prefer some time to think and plan but it doesn't seem I have that. I've been in the school to look around and despite it being just one hall I am still nervous about even walking out of a class by myself. The thing I am most afraid of is messing up or someone talking to me and I come off as mean in some way! I tend to get a bit snappy or glare when someone talks to me cause the first thing I think is that they are being forced to talk to me or it's a joke! I don't want to glare at someone by a accident and make everyone in my new school hate me. I'm also afraid I might accidently break a rule.. I usually avoid everything possible so that doesn't happen..but I'm still worried. My dad tells me to just push through the anxiety but I feel like I'm gonna die.. we already planned on writing on sticky notes when I want to speak to the teachers but still everything else involving my existence in this place sounds terrifying to me.

Support and suggestions on how to calm down would be good- I might end up staying up all night because of all of this.."
1436,Anxiety,I can't work here anymore,"Hello, r/Anxiety,

Without diving too deep into my struggle with anxiety, I'll provide a bit of relevant information to explain my situation.

I work in healthcare, in a job with massive responsibility and massive related stress. To keep it short, I'm responsible for conducting tests that ultimately determine the wellbeing of the patients in our community hospital. I'm good at my job and cautious to boot, but the weight of the role has been detrimental enough to my mental wellbeing that over that last five years I've been to multiple therapists, called out at an increasingly regular rate due to anxiety induced insomnia, have had to take a month off on short term disability to recover from an especially difficult bout of depression and anxiety and truly believe that if I stay in this role I am going continue to suffer even further. I can't live with it anymore. To be blunt, the role has taken a toll on my mental health in a really awful way. I have not been able to relax my mind and live presently and calmly in half a decade. I am genuinely suffering everyday.

 The stress if the work itself is only compounded by a chaotic schedule - after my medical leave I requested, on the advice of my practioner, for reduced hours. Not only was I denied reduced hours but my schedule was made nonsensical and unpredictable- my set schedule has become a salad of different shifts. This week alone I work 11a-7p one day, 6a-3p the next, followed by 3p-11p and then circling back to 11-7. I don't even have time to prepare myself for these hours - the schedules are frequently posted only 2-3 days in advance.

I am wrapping up my final courses for a new degree that will allow me to start a new career in something less intense, which should be complete by February of 2022. While I realize that light at the end of the tunnel is so close, it seems so far away and I don't think I can or should stick it out for even that much longer. The issue tying me to my present position is unfortunately health insurance. My husband relies on the insurance from my employer to see the multiple doctors he needs to keep his blood pressure, cholesterol and mental health in check. If I leave my employer, that insurance is gone. So you can see, it is difficult to just put in my two weeks and hope something comes along. 

With all that said, my question is this; are there any options for actually affordable healthcare if I leave my employment? The doctor who took me out of work last year for mental health reasons is no longer at her practice, so I'm not sure a new doctor that I have no history with would be so willing to do that again while I look for something new. Looking at the marketplace, my options appear to begin at about 500 dollars each, monthly, which is 1000 dollars I won't have if I am not working. 

I just feel stuck and I need help or guidance making a really important move away from where I am now. I feel hopeless and kind of terrified. Is there any viable way anyone knows of that can make this work? I've looked into retail employers which would cut my salary in half but would be worth it to save my aching brain, but even that is anxiety inducing because I don't even know if any of these employers would hire me. I feel like I could make money for private insurance on my own if only it were about half the estimated price that I'm finding it to actually be. 

Thanks. 

Also, the fact that we (Americans) are forced into unhealthy labor situations by employers dangling healthcare like a carrot from a stick makes me fucking nauseous."

1439,Anxiety,Can panic attack last only a few seconds?,"Ive had two panic attacks before but they lasted thirty minutes each.

Are these panic attacks? Can they only last a couple seconds?"
1440,Anxiety,Does anyone get ocular migraines?,"I get them once in awhile. I haven’t had one in like several months and got one just a bit ago. I woke up twice tonight and felt a frontal/forehead on/off slight headache and didn’t think much of it, fell asleep and woke up a bit ago to my vision looking weird like I was freaking out cause I didn’t know what was happening yet and then I started seeing the ocular migraine start and it wasn’t much this time but for like 5 minutes the visual part, I took Tylenol just now. 

Everytime I get these I get extremely anxious, I had a mri in November 2018 &amp; a ct scan in October 2020 and all normal but I still get so anxious cause these migraines mess with your vision ugh. 

Anyone else?"

1442,Anxiety,Intense fear of video calls,"Over the entire pandemic I’ve managed to avoid making video calls entirely as I already worked from home, communicating with people via email. I’ve recently sought help for some medical issues and because of the pandemic lots of services are still using video calls for appointments. I have an intense fear of phone calls and video calls and because of this I’ve cancelled numerous appointments at the last minute or simply just turned my devices off to pretend nothing is happening. I don’t know why I’m like this but when I’m sat waiting for a call I just get overwhelmingly anxious and convince myself that I don’t need whatever appointment I’m supposed to have. 

I know long term this is an issue I need to get over (probably with the help of mental health professionals) but does anyone have any tricks to get over this in the short term?"
1443,Anxiety,Can you hyperventilate without even realising it?,My right leg keeps getting this prickly feeling every so often around my calf and leg in general. Only mild and not painful but it’s a weird sensation. It’s like someone is lightly stabbing me with a needle then it goes. I have been told i could not be breathing properly but I can’t tell if i am or not.
1444,Anxiety,2 hours fretting for a 2 minute phone call.,"Today, i called the psychology team who see me for my anxiety. It was a necessary call as I need to cancel my appointment for reasons I cannot disclose. But, understandably I was very scared to do so. 

I hate phone calls, because I cannot see what the other person is doing on the other end. I know they can potentially see unpleasant things about me - my search history, my address, my thoughts, my dreams. 

Anyway, after two hours of pacing and wondering how they were going to get to me, I bit the bullet and phoned up. 

the lady who answered wanted my name, my date of birth, and my address, all of which I was very reluctant to give over. She was firm but patient, I gave her my old address, rather than my current, which thankfully she accepted from me - another reason I’m grateful to have not updated my medical records.. 

I can’t let these people know who or what I am. I’m still waiting for the day the health services all find out about the monstrosities and knock down my door in the new town I live in. 

the worst part of the phone call was when she asked “WHY” I am cancelling the appointment. I told her I cannot disclose, but that it was personal, and I just can’t attend. She seemed suspicious, which threw me into a cycle of doubt and fear and anxiety. 

Will she know I’m lying? I don’t know if I can ever show my face to my doctors again. But they know me and how to contact me which is terrifying.

Does anyone else get anxiety like this? or feel like they need to go on the run and start a new life to hide from the evil thoughts? The past? The stress of holding someone else’s life together?"
1445,Anxiety,Please help me,"So I get stomach pain with stress, and it's getting worse and worse. A few years ago, I got it badly enough and often enough that I couldn't do classes, couldn't do anything.

1446,Anxiety,Existential crisis about being Florida trash,"This is more of a vent so sorry if this is long 

When I woke up this morning I had a full blown anxiety attack. I’ve been having some major self esteem issues since 2020, about my class and my status in society. 

It’s been eating away at me for a while, and I’m becoming incredibly self conscious. About my looks, my mannerisms. I suffer from social anxiety and depression, and I’m pretty sure it shows in public. 

I’m terrified at the prospect of aging badly and becoming a stereotypical “Florida woman”, and feel like there’s no escaping it. I was raised in an abusive lower-middle class family and have been trying to “move up” in the world. 

What triggered this is getting a new job, my first real job. 

I’m interacting with people who are on a corporate level, who come from better environments. It’s all very overwhelming and I’m becoming increasingly self critical and scared. This fear has made me leave jobs, because I just want to hide away from the world. 

My anxiety has been so bad for the last few weeks that my hair has been falling out. I’m very unhappy in general. 

But, I have to wait for my insurance to kick in to see a therapist or a doctor. I desperately want to take a few days off, but can’t because I’m new. I don’t want to reinforce the suspicions that there’s something wrong with me I suppose."
1447,Anxiety,Trying to get the courage to talk to my doctor,"Hi all :)

I had my first panic attack at the age of 14, and at the age of 26 I still struggle with anxiety, although thankfully I have managed to improve a lot due to a lot of hard work. 

I was brushed off when I thought I needed help at 14, with people around me saying its probably just hormonal and I'll grow out of it etc. That completely put me off getting help because whenever I consider it I feel like an intruder.

Will a doctor think I don't need help if I've ""managed"" for this long without it? I'm terrified to take the step but for the first time in my life almost feel strong enough to do so."
1448,Anxiety,"Overanalyse every social situation, feel incapable of making friends","I have really struggled with anxiety; even from childhood, I was over apologetic over everything, which only got progressively worse as I go to secondary school, to the point I basically didn't attend school. Eventually, once I left school, it got a bit better. But because of it, I've never really had a social group and always felt like I was missing out. 

Eventually, I went to University, and for the first time in my life, I was confident and had friends. But being in a social group still gave me anxiety- especially the politics of it all. The friends I made could be lovely, but they also had a lot to say about everyone behind their backs. And I found myself joining in with them, desperate to be a part of a group. I met my current partner, and I found myself being embarrassed about what we would say about people, especially in front of him. It wasn't nice. 

And basically, from there, it all blew up. I was living with the group of girls, and I was making a cup of tea and saw my name flash up on my housemate's phone. It was a bitchy text about me; they were saying nasty things behind my back. This was it for me, and I basically said I want no part of the bitching. Which offended my friend, and to cut a long story short, they excluded me from the group. All my ex-friends would come over to our house for drinks nights, takeaways, parties, and I was never invited. I would say hello to my ex-friend, and she would ignore me, and the rest would follow suit. To put it in context, we were all studying fashion together at uni- so a lot of big egos. 

Since then, my anxiety has gotten progressively worse; I'm full of so much self-hatred and feel like I am incapable of having friendships. I have finished Uni and have move cities with my partner, we love living in the city- but we have no friends. We moved in lockdown, which doesn't help. 

We went to a gig on Sunday and bumped into my partner's old friend from his city. He was really nice, and so were his friends. But I found myself feeling really crappy afterwards, like over analysing every little thing I did in case I was weird or unfriendly. Feel totally socially incapable now. Felt like we came across as desperate."
1449,Anxiety,Physical symptoms of anxiety + medication,"I've had anxiety for the best part of 10 years now, but only in the past year or so it's got extremely bad and is having a serious affect on every aspect of my life. When I get anxious my throat tightens up causing me to gag and struggle for air, also my stomach starts churning which just makes the experience a lot worse. 

My anxiety is triggered by situations that I can't just easily walk away from. So I'm usually fine if I just walk into a shop on my own and pick up a couple of things, but once I get in the queue for checkout and there's people around me, I get these violent symptoms and I just want to drop everything and run, usually when my anxiety gets triggered in these situations I am too afraid to go back and put myself in those situations again which has also had a huge negative affect on my mental health simply because I haven't been leaving my house much

Would medication be my best option to help me manage this anxiety? I've tried CBT in the past but didn't find it very effective at all unfortunately. I just want to start living my life again, I'm 20 years old and I feel like the most valuable years of my life are being wasted because of this, any input is greatly appreciated!"
1450,Anxiety,"I've recently invested my whole money in under construction apartment, and ever since that day my life has become hell.","Hello, I've been having panick attacks in random moments ever since I HAPPILY invested every penny I'd gotten in my apartment. They come from random thoughts that suddenly pop up in my head: earthquake gonna destroy it and I'M GONNA BECOME HOMELESS; the elevator's gonna become faulty and I WON'T BE ABLE TO SELL IT AND I WILL HAVE TO WALK UP 11 STAIRS EVERY DAY WHEN I'M OLD; My neighbors' gonna cause fire and I WILL BECOME HOMELESS; the deal wasn't that good, I got  scammed and EVERYONE'S GONNA LAUGH AT MY FAILURES; etc..

This is the only time I've ever done something this major, I don't even take manor risks, EVER. This is the first time in how many years that I've to trust ""fate"".  I've made a big mistake. A person like me shouldn't have taken on a challenge this big.


How do I let go of my worries? I don't currently take any medications, but no panick attack has ever been this big - until now I've never experienced a meltdown, that I remember for sure. The isurance situation is pretty taught, is visiting a doctor for medications the only good option?"
1451,Anxiety,Butterflies in stomach...,"I think I have a crush on a girl, and since she is in my friend group we see each other from time to time. When I'm around her or just thinking about her I get this really really strong butterfly in the stomach type of effect, It kills my appetite, it messes up my stomach and it brings nausea. I think this may have something to do with anxiety? I don't get this strong of a reaction when I'm about to do important stuff, like taking an exam. I hate this feeling because it makes me physically ill. Can someone relate? By the way, I don't know if it's a wise idea to man up and just tell her, because I have no clue if she even knows I exist. 

Don't even know if it's the right sub to post in, but I'll give it a shot"

1453,Anxiety,Anxiety of measuring blood pressure,"Hi all! I have had a lot of anxiety about my blood pressure reading, and I thought there would be other people with same situation. 

I stress a lot about my blood pressure and I measure it many times per day (""best"" days probably 20-40 Times). Sometimes, readings are 120/80 which is normal in my opinion. But sometimes I feel very stressed when taking blood pressure it might be 130-140/90-95. 

Anyone in same situation? This stress me a lot, even though I know (in some level) that this high blood pressure is because of anxiety."
1454,Anxiety,Would it be in my best interest to talk to a doctor?,"So I get anxious, I can't remember not being an anxious person. I also have been diagnosed with ADHD but that's neither here nor there. 

For the past couple years I've been struggling with feeling like I might die soon, I also stress pointlessly about finances, my future, the fact I never know what I'm doing or how to do anything. I analyse every little thing going on in my body and out and tend to blow it out of proportion in my head. I've tried a selection of SSRIs but I just can't stand them. I've done over a years therapy and got nothing out of it. Is it worth having a conversation with a doctor again or is this just something I kinda have to deal with my whole life?

I'm only asking cause I'm getting so damn tired of having it sap the joy out of even my favourite things like my workouts or video games and it's really, really wearing me out. I still do them as much as possible, it's just hard when you're trying to squat or go for a run and you can't shake the thought that I could have a heart attack and die at any minute. Especially now I've had the Pfizer vaccine I'm terrified it's gonna kill me."
1455,Anxiety,I WILL RECOVER,"Hi guys how are you!
These days have been very bad tbh, I thought this summer would be my summer, but no, nothing good happened. I have been so anxious, and after thinking and thinking, I got a conclusion. Guys in tired, I'm tired of beeing anxious, I want to be happy, I want that my only worry during the day is what I'm going to have for dinner, I want to be FREE.
The conclusion I got is that I have been Complaining and Victimizing myself every time I have to deal with this shit, and nothing happened. No matter how many times I cried, how many times I shout cause the rage of having this, nothing happened. And it will never happen, CAUSE I M NOT WORKING. That's the conclusion, TO BE FREE we have to be better than the guy who entered in this anxiety world, we have to be better than Our past self, and to do that we have to work. I'm not talking about doing meditation one day, and the rest of the week not doing nothing, I'm talking about really beeing constant. How many time do we thought "" if I would have started working 4 months ago, now I would be free"", then why don't we start now?
I'm not gonna lie, I do not feel good now, I'm feeling numb, like with no emotions, I'm feeling disconnected from the world (dpdr) I'm feeling so weird and I'm having a fear of going crazy constantly. I'm literally analyzing everything that happens to me and my anxious brain automatically tries to just relate it with a mental illnes. That means I'm so anxious, and I'm not doing the right steps.
Guys I swear to God, and I swear to all of you if you read this, that I'm going to work, I will start my day at 7am by beeing thankfull and meditate, every day, 2 times per day 15 minutes, I will do yoga 4 times a week once a day, I will eat healthy, no sugar, no salt, no caffeine, only healthy food and many fruits and vegetables. I will try to cry once a week, ( it helps with numbness feelings) I will start no fap (it may help with social anxiety, I know many ppl don't think it helps, but I will try it by myself) and I will keep going to the gym as I do now.
Guys Im sure this is just anxiety, even if my brain is constantly trying to tell me is something more serious. I won't give up. I can.
I will keep you updated in 10 days."
1456,Anxiety,Alot of dental issues,"So just as the title says I went to the dentist yesterday and was told I have alot of cavities and need 2 root canals. This terrified me, so much so I panicked and couldn't stay in the office and left shortly after. I guess my fear really just comes from the lack of control and possibility of pain during the procedure. When the dentist was annoyed that I wouldn't stay she wrote a referral for me to go to a specialist with a note saying due to my nervousness I probably need sedation. The problem is, THIS also scares me due to me hearing about things going wrong with it. It's going to be hard to get myself to go back knowing what awaits me, but all I'm gonna do for now until then is carefully brush the cavities to make sure they don't get worse since they aren't causing any pain currently. If you read all this, thanks for your time."

1458,Anxiety,Do you have any suggestions for how to overcome my really bad fear of heights?,"I have issues with everything related to heights. At one point I tried working on it and it got a little better and then it just got way worse. I think its now worse that it ever has been. I won't even use an escalator at a two story mall near me or climb up a ladder. My most recent issue is that I've gone back to school. My classes are in the science building. The lectures are on the third floor, which doesn't bother me nearly as much because you can see the walkways and other buildings on that level. But, my labs are on the fourth floor. Last week was the first week of classes and I didn't do too bad going up for the lab. But, I went up yesterday and did horribly. I rode the elevator up and it had a little jolt when it got going and that was all that it took. I had a full blown anxiety/panic attack. I wanted to immediately leave but couldn't. I mean it was nausea, shaking, hyperventilating, heart pounding, felt like the floor was swaying under me, sweating profusely. I had to try to calm myself down, which didn't go that well and sit through a like hour and a half lecture while have anxiety attacks. I kept trying to tell myself that I've been higher than that and have been fine but it didn't work the best.

Sorry for the long post. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this get better? I felt hopeless with it yesterday. I like the college program I'm in but was even thinking of dropping out of it because of the height anxiety. How do you deal with your heights issues?

Is there something wrong with me that it bothers me that much and no one else that I saw on the floor had an issue like I did? My fear of heights embarrasses me a lot and makes me think there's something wrong with me."

I just moved in with my girlfriend a few months ago and she is so patient and understanding with my memory issues, but it's causing me to forget to do housework I promised I'd do, or buy things at the store I agreed to buy and I feel terrible about it.

Intermediate class, more or less like beginners but they'll throw in a couple more complicated moves or sequences

And advanced, this is full on, put on a wrestling match without planning anything. In this class you've got the best of the best.... and me

I was absolutely fine with training, really confident in the ring until I got invited to advanced, even before my session I was broken, the entire day before and day of training I'm a nervous wreck, literally shaking, vomiting, having a full break down and I genuinely don't know why, I hate being like this, it's completely taken the fun out of wrestling because I feel like this now going back into the beginners class as well, I can't even watch wrestling anymore without that knot in my stomach 

Thing is, it is just the wrestling, during lockdown our school closed and I joined a boxing gym to keep myself occupied, absolutely no fear, no anxiety, I'd get in the ring to spar or I'd have a bout, complete zen

You mention wrestling to me, I'm a quivering wreck. 

Is this something I should brute force my way through and hope it gets better?"
1464,Anxiety,"I have the chance to immigrate to Canada, and I'm freaking out.","I decided to get evaluated on a whim to see if I qualify to immigrate to Canada. 

I did. I qualified. All I need to do is get a job and I can move across in as soon as 6 months.

All this is so overwhelming for me. It feels like it's moving too much too fast. I did this on a whim expecting nothing to come out of it, only to have this opportunity to change my life. And now I'm so afraid to take this step.

Who's going to want to hire me? I'm  a nobody, a below average plain Jane. I have no achievements to speak of, I do not have a good work record.

But a small part of me wants to take this a run at full speed. Escape my toxic mother. Escape the awful work culture that gave me PTSD. Start new, start fresh. 

It's crushing me. I don't even know what to do now. Where do I start? What's the next step? Where do I go from here? It's driving me crazy!

Please help..."
1465,Anxiety,Would you date someone with HSV1 (herpes)? This cuases me anxiety,"I promise this is related to anxiety, because I have tried to google this question before when it was asked to the general population and most are not concerned at all about this. They say that 90% already have it and that most just don't have any symptoms.

I have always had a very big fear of catcthing an STD. I have gone to the doctors to have them examine skin tags and razor burns and all sort of stuff just to be sure.

Now I have been on two dates with a girl from tinder that told me she has HSV1. She said its 2 years since her last outbreak and that her ex she was with for 7 years never got it.

But I'm stuck in my tracks now, I don't know if I should call this off. The idea that her HSV can spread to my nether region is horryfing to me.

So I want to come here and ask people that may feel similar to me about this. Because my brain would interepret getting HSV as getting HIV. Like it's life ending. I know that's the anxiety and that I am overreacting, but we wouldn't care about our anxiety if we could just sit in it. 

I am already in therapy but that is slow going and my therapist is not a specialist for anxiety so I might ask for a remission.

But what would you do if you were in my situation?"
1466,Anxiety,I just need to vent,I am literally crippled with anxiety 24/7 these last few days. I moved out of my parents home for the first time and I’ve been handling it horribly. Everyday is a struggle. And it’s all because of anxiety. It’s been making me nauseous so I haven’t ate anything. Which is giving me a huge fear of losing too much weight which feeds into my anxiety. I keep telling myself itll get better but I’m so sick of complaining to my family and boyfriend. I feel like I’m dragging them down with me. They don’t fully understand why I’m feeling this. I don’t even understand. I know I’m supposed to be having fun but I wake up every morning crying and wanting to give up. The worst part of anxiety is it prevents you from growing and becoming the person you want to be. I wish I could turn it off and explain to it that I’m fine here. But for now I’m just doing all I can to stick it out and not give up.
1467,Anxiety,My weird anxiety triggers,"Throughout the years my anxiety have evolved into weirdly specific triggers. I would be afraid to eat in front of people. Fearing that my hands will shake or tremor. I will avoid eating foods like soup so it would not be obvious when my hands start shaking. 

Then it evolved to the weird fear of not being able to keep still. Whenever I’m in a situation whereby I’m required to keep still. I will have strong anxiety about it. And then my body will start to tremor. I haven’t went to a hair salon for years because of this. 

I could tell my therapist this problem because I’m so afraid that they will judge me for this weird problem"
1468,Anxiety,Can you take both adderall and anti anxiety pills ? And if so what anti anxiety pills work the best ?,

1470,Anxiety,I don’t enjoy summer at all?,"As ashamed as I am to admit this, I don’t enjoy summer. 

The main reason is that I hate showing off my body. My clothing style is casual and modest - I usually wear jeans or leggings and rarely get dressed up. I hate the pressure to dress nicely and wear skirts/dresses in summer. I hate going shopping and seeing stores full of clothes that just aren’t my style. 

I also don’t deal well with heat. Walking around on a hat day often makes me physically ill. A few weeks ago, I started vomiting after a day out in the sun. 

Another thing I don’t like about summer is the pressure to make plans and be out all of the time. Seeing people on social media having fun with their friends makes me feel inadequate. I never have exciting summer plans - like going on holiday. 

I’m 19 and most people my age look forward to summer. But I just don’t. I spent this whole summer in the house (apart from a few solo trips to my city centre.) I’m really glad we’re heading into Autumn/Winter. Can anyone else relate?"
1471,Anxiety,Bad anxiety about ex?,"Would like to know if someone has the same… so I broke up over a year ago and I have moved on, been in a great new relationship for a while now but just thinking about my ex makes me nauseous. When he used to sent messages after we broke up (tried to stay friends for a while) I legit almost threw up because I became so anxious. It‘s now been better since I blocked him a few months ago because his presence in my life made me too nervous, and I hope time will make it easier to not get triggered that much"
1472,Anxiety,Hey it’s me again.,"I posted last week about how I’m going through it right now and I just can’t seem to dig myself out of the hole I’m in. I received such kind messages, thank you. I really love this community because it makes me feel like what I’m feeling is normal because others feel it too.

I made the extremely tough decision to go back onto Prozac. It’s been a very long time since I’ve been on any medication for my anxiety so I don’t remember what exactly to expect. I’m on day 2. Im taking 10mg for the week and then bumping up to 20 next week. I’m so anxious. All I wanna do is sit on my couch. I haven’t had a real appetite in like 3 weeks and it’s making me even more anxious that I can’t eat. I just wanna feel normal again.

For those of you that take medication.. at what point should I expect to start feeling better? Tell me your success stories so that I can maybe see the light at the end of the tunnel."
1473,Anxiety,How do u cope anxiety and panic when its too hot?,
1474,Anxiety,Pls help me. I'm having a panic attack. I cant think clearly. I need help. Pls I'm begging.,"21F. I am having a major panic attack. Am I a p3do? The show stranger things showed children making out and I remember searching up the video on YouTube and watching it very closely and getting turned on. I was like 18,19,20."
1475,Anxiety,Monophobia or something else...?,"I quit weed 84 days ago and since quitting I've had extreme monophobia (fear of being alone). I spent the first 45 days of my recovery with my aunt, who lives upstairs from me. I was terrified to be alone in my apartment--I felt dread, extreme anxiety and unbelievable fear anytime I was alone. The only time I felt better was at night, when I was totally fine being alone. 

While the symptoms have lifted somewhat, I still get extremely anxious anytime I am alone in my apartment. I feel like being alone is somehow dangerous/scary/dreadful.

I know this is pretty odd, but I am wondering if anyone else experiences this problem. Do you live alone? How do you deal with this anxiety? Is there anything that makes it better?"
1476,Anxiety,Anxiety killing creativity,"I work in a creative industry where I have to write/create every day. My anxiety in the past few months has been some of the worst it's ever been.  I'm in ""survival mode"" with the same fears running over and over in my head. I'm procrastinating, and honestly don't trust that what I hand in is hitting the mark. It's hindered my work, to the point where I'm wondering if I need to have a conversation with my boss. Any creatives have any advice?"
1477,Anxiety,I Don't Know What to Do...,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder shortly after my mother passed away in 2013. Since then, I've been on medications and regularly seeing a psychotherapist for mood control, anger management, and trauma processing. I've never really considered myself an anxious person until I moved out on my own recently. 

Of course, this is a huge step in life, and any normal person would be nervous living by themselves in this big ol' world. But I've noticed a spiraling pattern recently. My therapist noticed some OCD tendencies developing in my behavior (anxiety--obviously--, counting, pulling my hair out during panic attacks, catastrophizing,  aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others, unwanted thoughts, including aggression, or sexual or religious subjects, etc.) but didn't feel like I was diagnosable for the disorder. She claims that COVID-19s impacts on my day-to-day life have manifested these kinds of symptoms in my behavior. It doesn't help that I'm already a certified control freak.

The point is, I can't function. When I wake up in the morning, I'm fine. When I drive to work or class, I'm fine. But the moment I'm not doing anything--the moment I have a second to breathe--I panic. If I have finished my homework and all my quizzes, with the afternoon open to chill, I fall apart. Weekends are a nightmare because I'm this anxious mess for the entire day, as I don't know what to do with myself. I hate feeling like this. If there isn't anything to do at work, my chest gets very heavy and my breaths are shallow as I try not to go into a panic attack. My relationship is suffering because my anxiety is mistaken for moodiness; I would go out more often, but I'm currently broke, so the options are limited. I'm lost, and I don't know how to get out of this cycle. I deserve downtime to do what I want. 

But my brain won't let me. Either I do something, or I fucking implode."
1478,Anxiety,Avoidence,"I was doing fine for a while, being able to go places and do things despite anxiety. But now, all of a sudden, for the past few days, I find my avoiding things again. My stomach's been hurting for a few days and I think it's just anxiety, so I tell people I'm sick, but I can't tell them I'm sick forever. I don't want to go out and face the world anymore. Last week was super stressful and I emotionally crashed and I think it triggered another existential crisis. Everything feels meaningless and pointless. I don't really want to do anything. I just want to stay in my bedroom and avoid people and the world. It feels safe in my room, it doesn't feel safe out there. 

Please help."

I have no problems at interviews but when it comes time to show up and work I let my anxiety get the best of me and can’t show up.

I came into this week with new intentions set, a positive mindset, and was doing really well this morning, and then all of a sudden things at work weren't the best - I had a misstep with scheduling something (though not 100% my fault, I will obviously blame myself), I entered a request wrong so now have to start from scratch, I just feel like I can't get myself organized and straightened out.

I am just feeling very overwhelmed today, and on the verge of tears."
1483,Anxiety,Anxiety suddenly much worse,"Hey all,

So a little background.  Anxiety has always been something that affected me moderately, from time to time if things got really hectic and stressful in life.

However, lately that's taken a turn.  It is suddenly (and I mean suddenly) a daily occurrence for me.  It doesn't take much of anything to set it off, anything that is even moderately stressful puts me in this weird headspace where I'm just filled with worry.  My chest gets tight, I get a lump in my stomach, and all I can do is try to think good thoughts.  It feels crippling.

I do take Adderall for ADHD; however, skipping the medication for a few days didn't seem to change anything.  I know this isn't the place for medical advice, just venting and wondering if anyone else has experienced a sudden onset of anxiety like this?  If so, were you able to get past it?"
1484,Anxiety,Taking a semester off to focus on therapy for my anxiety.... and it's making me anxious,"I have a pretty bad anxiety disorder paired with a heart condition, so that means I never know which one triggers the other but it's never one without the other and it gets pretty annoying. So I decided to take a semester off from university to go to therapy (I can't do both at the same time). So that means I'm moving back in with my mom so I had to give my 30-day notice to my landlord this morning and for some reason this made me so anxious. I have to laugh about it because it just confirmed that I made the right decision. Now I have to call my wifi provider to cancel my plan... I think I'll wait a few hours:') Thanks for letting me vent, I hope everyone has a good day!"

I’m excited to go abroad and have been planning to go since I entered college, but to have it become a reality is making me really nervous all of a sudden. 

I’m stressed about leaving my family and pets, stressed about being in a foreign country with no one familiar to me for the next semester, and stressed about flying and going through airport and immigration all by myself for the first time ever. 

Does anyone have any advice to help with anxiety or any tips as to how to help with the homesickness?"
1487,Anxiety,anxiety is killing me,"I can't spend 1 minute and feel calm, thinking about living now, I live comparing my life with the people in the videos I watch. I just wanted to have friends and leave the house at ease, have my independence, I can't stand this pandemic and this isolation anymore. I'm 20 years old and I keep thinking about what my next years will be like. I know that exercising is good for me, but now it's given me total discouragement. I'm crying too much writing this, I can't take it anymore"
1488,Anxiety,How to manage anxiety while thinking of the worst case scenario?,"My anxiety makes me think of the worst case scenario for everything. wether it be my relationship or just my future in general. in the present, nothing is wrong. But I cannot stop my head from going to that bad place, and constantly thinking of what COULD happen. My anxiety got so bad i relapsed with self harm last night, I just need help managing it. does anybody have any tips?"
1489,Anxiety,"I need answers before 6am CST : ) Going to school tomorrow, which do you think I should put in an essential oil necklace, lavender or smiles for miles? One is calming while the other is uplifting, I'm really nervous but also wanna be in a good mood, I'll have lavender in bag as well. Thanks",
1490,Anxiety,Anyone else finds waiting for a reply agonizing?,"Whenever you message to ask someone else something, every moment that passes while waiting for them to reply just feels like agony.

Can't help but constantly feel that I'm doing something wrong, I shouldn't have asked, etc.

Now my heart is just racing out of nowhere and man I just want to hide and lie down somewhere lol."
1491,Anxiety,Getting so frustrated…,"I know you guys here get it, so I’ll vent openly. I got diagnosed with anxiety and panic disorder when I was 18 and now I’m 32 with bouts of depression here and there. I’ve consistently seen a therapist since working on everything from CBT, to deep breathing and general talk. I’ve also had a psychiatrist oversee my meds which for the most part have been similar with a few change ups here and there throughout the years. Currently, I’m on a small dose of klonopin daily (0.5) and a medium dose of celexa. This was after a few years of trial and error with various others. I have also introduced marijuana into the mix and find it more helpful than anything else (at first) but being high eventually becomes the new norm and that’s another story… 

I’ve realized recently that when I’m asked how I’m doing, my answer is never based on how I’m actually doing. It’s based on how I’m doing this week vs last or this year vs last year. I suppose this is a positive way to look at it but in all honesty, I don’t feel “good.” And can’t even remember what “good” is. I wake up every day with a pit in my stomach and tight chest. I force myself to do everything because it’s what therapy has taught me. Get out of bed, workout, get out of the house… ok, we’ll I’ve done that everyday and I still feel like shit. 

The constant work is really starting to add another layer of depression into the mix and ultimately some resentment as well. I feel like I can’t truly appreciate or have fun with anything because I’ve literally had to force myself to do it. 

Last but not least, as I’m getting older and working out more, when my heart rate passes 120 or so, I launch into anxiety and depersonalization that can last hours. It doesn’t make me want to work out at all. I’ve also been working out consistently 5 days a week for almost a year hoping this would get better and it hasn’t. 

Super frustrating. I feel like every few years I have to figure out an entirely new regimen for relief and it’s really getting me down. I almost wish I did have an actual physical ailment that can be treated appropriately vs this shit. 

Ugh, such a downer but I know you guys get it. 🙏"
1492,Anxiety,school is starting soon and it’s freaking me out,"before the pandemic i was really bad at making friends, but i managed to have a friend group i could float around in during school, but i wasn’t really close to anyone. i haven’t seen any of these people since the pandemic started and school ended, and i’ve never texted them or invited them out because of my social anxiety, while everyone else in the group has continued to hang out and grow closer without me. i still want to be friends with them but idk how to reinsert myself into the group when school starts again after all this time apart. any suggestions?? and if it doesn’t work out any suggestions for making new friends?"
1493,Anxiety,Health anxiety - headaches,"I get headaches sometimes for instance, and I get anxious right away. They bring me high anxiety. I just start worrying about so much like everything I know about health. I had a mri in November 2018 normal and had ct scan in October 2020, normal. I still worry everytime I get a headache. 

Anyways the one I have today was by my neck and back of head felt muscular. Now it’s more in the front part like forehead area kind of dull achey ness on/off and some pressure feelings on/off around that area between eyes/forehead. My eyes feel tired too. I am exhausted. I didn’t sleep well last night cause of a panic attack in the middle of the night. It’s been a super anxious stressful week cause I keep worrying about one thing to another health wise. 

Anybody else like this? And get headaches like the one I described"
1494,Anxiety,Anyone else make weird noises or random screams when it becomes too much to handle sometimes?,"This might sound like a joke post but I'm serious lol I find myself making random meows or woofs or sometimes loud long awoos when it gets too much to handle. I scream too sometimes. And it can be very random, without rhyme or reason and it oddly helps and is very cathartic somehow. I dunno."
1495,Anxiety,Anyone take vitamins or something similar to help with anxiety rather than a prescription?,"I have tried CBD oils and gummies. When I first started I thought maybe they were helping, but found out I was allergic to some of the oils, and the gummies did nothing really. I can not afford going to a doctor.

I have seen a couple of vitamin like things like Olly (links 1-3 below) at Target and was wondering if anyone has tried that for anxiety? Also care/of Relaxation (link 4).

1498,Anxiety,Being stalked,"About 2-3 ago someone stopped me as I was walking home and stopped me in their car and gave me their number. I took it but didn’t call. 2 days later this person showed up as I was walking to the grocery store. I live in a big city so I use Uber or I walk everywhere. He then proceeded to say why I didn’t call etc I shooed him away. Then the week later I noticed him directly across parked from my house. I pretended to call the cops and he drove away. I kept seeing him repeatedly as I would walk he would drive by or parked down the street or around the corner 


After a month or so I called him because I wanted to see what his deal was and tell him that I see him stalking and to knock it off. I didn’t even get that far. On the phone call we didn’t even talk 5 minutes before he made a sexual remark and I hung up and blocked him. I know I should have went to the police but it’s a very complicated situation because he works at a very prominent job for the city I live. I’m scared to report him also I have severe ptsd and do not have a support system. I freeze whenever I see him so I don’t get photos of the incident. I think I get freeze trauma response when I see him. I have severe anxiety about filing police reports and then opening an investigation it reminds me of my entire past and how bad it was. So because of this I’ve literally been letting this person stalk me 


I feel horrible. I also notice sometimes I don’t see him for a while and then he reappears once I forget about him. I notice when he passes by in the car he never talks to me or waves. So I saw him down the street from my house so the next time I saw him I waved at him I didn’t smile. He looked really shocked. I waved because I wanted him to know I see him!! I feel like an idiot but this is so hard to deal with 


What does he get out of monitoring me? Why when I waved did he act like he didn’t know me? Do stalkers ever just give up and go away? I don’t understand why he will not just speak to me. I’m so confused"

I’ve vomited many times but never lost consciousness. Sometimes I have to lie down with my feet in the air and I usually feel fine after a few minutes. The question I guess is: does my anxiety cause this? According to the cardiologist my heart is fine and I have no other conditions but whenever I exert and start to sweat sometimes my blood pressure drops and I feel sick. Anyone else experience anything similar?"
1502,Anxiety,trying new meds,"Hello all.

I'll try to keep this brief. 

So I've been on Zoloft for two years and it helped a little bit in that it took me from suicidal and depressed back to average/mildly anxious. 

I recently hit the max dose of 200mg\* and I feel confident that, although it has helped a bit, Zoloft is not the medicine for me.

The problem is... I don't know what's next. I'm thinking my psych may put me on Paxil or Celexa but whatever happens, I'm anxious because. 1. it'll be the first time I try a new med in two years and 2. it'll be the third anxiety med I've tried.

Anyone else tried multiple meds? what's that like and how did you get through it?"

1504,Anxiety,Vaccine anxiety.,"Hello world. So, I have generalized anxiety disorder. I went last Sunday to get my first Pfizer dose and honestly it was a dramatic scene from a movie to say the least. While I am grateful to have the opportunity to have a vaccine.. I have to say I was one of the skeptics and really unsure. Finally I gave into getting it... right away I had a metallic taste in my mouth after the shot, my anxiety made me even more tired. And I did not sleep AT ALL that evening until the next day! My anxiety was bad. I have a sensation where I feel like my brain zaps and a little bit of a heart flutter. I can’t tell if this is my anxiety or actually a side effect. Anyway, I’m so scared to get the second dose :/ I keep thinking what if I die after it... this is my mind on anxiety

How did you all deal with vaccine (if you chose to get it )  or covid this year"
1505,Anxiety,Not asking for a medical diagnosis but if anyone on the sub has had a similar event happen to them.,"Sorry if this might be a long post as well but I just have some questions about if what happened to me was a normal occurrence.

 I’ve always been a anxious person as I’m guessing mostly everyone else here has been as well, so Im aware of what happened that day and what caused this panic/anxiety attack.  So one day (and I promise this is a serious post/discussion) me and my brother go on a trip to the woods in upstate NY in the late winter.  And on the second day me and him decide to drop acid.  Again i know that me having anxiety and taking lsd isn’t the best idea but I’m just asking if anyone else has had a similar thing occur to their body.  So after a while nothing is happening so we go on a bike ride since most of the snow had melted at this point.  We get to a lake and decide to smoke a joint.  Which in my mind I thought if anything this would calm me down.  But as we finish and get back to our bikes to ride back because it was getting cold af, both the lsd and marijuana high start to come up at the same time.  So as me being a very anxious person, I start to freak out.  I’ve posted something similar to r/lsd but thought I’d have a better discussion here.  On the bike ride back home I begin to believe that I’m dying and that my brain is shutting down. So as a result I have a full on mental breakdown. Like on the outside I was okay and I don’t think anyone would’ve noticed but my mind was racing.  After about maybe 4 minutes into the bike ride I feel a weird pain or spasm in my legs and stomach area and both my legs completely lock up and my bike tips over and I fall.  I physically couldn’t move my legs and had a hard time getting. It looked like when goats or sheep get scared and they just lock up and fall over.  Eventually I get home and I calm down but I’m still freaked out about what exactly happened and if anyone else had a similar thing happen to them? Thank you"
1506,Anxiety,I feel like I’ve ruined everyone’s night,"I’m with a bunch of my friends and we are renting out this airbnb, and I was super nervous about the whole thing and I collapsed and I was having anxiety attacks and I tried to go by myself but I feel like I bummed everyone out."
1507,Anxiety,Guided Mediation make you anxious?,"Anyone else get anxious from guided meditation? Having to follow instructions for 10 min makes me super anxious. I just want them to spend 1 min telling me how long I should breath in and out and if I should be thinking a specific word etc while doing that. Then for the next 9 min I just want calming music and no talking. 

Anyone else this way or do you enjoy being instructed the whole time? Don’t know why it bothers me so much."
1508,Anxiety,A method that has worked wonders for me.,"Hey friends. I like many of you have struggled with anxiety for all of my life. I am in the middle of tapering off a medication due to side effects, which has really amped up my anxiety once again. I've recently found a new thing that has helped soothe my anxiety immensely. Now I'm not saying this is a cure or that you should change your meds by any means. It's just a little thing I do that is a great source of calm and comfort for me, and maybe it could be for you too! 

So this all started because I decided to try to limit caffeine (which is crazy hard for me because I love coffee). I've replaced coffee with loose leaf herbal tea. But I don't simply make and drink tea, there's an extra step at the end that make me feel fucking euphoric. Here's what I've landed on after some experimentation.

First, get yourself a french press. 

Next, pick out some dried herbs, flowers, and/or fruit. I started out with chamomile flowers and branched out from there. It's important to get legit dried herbs and flowers, not that shit in tea bags. My favorites right now are chamomile/orange peel, and chamomile/lavender /mint. Pick out anything that sounds good to you - experimenting with different flavors is half the fun!

Boil your water (an electric tea kettle makes this really easy)

Place your herbs in the french press. I usually do like a teaspoon per cup of water, but it depends on your preference.

Pour the boiling water in the french press and put the plunger on top. Add some honey (optional) and stir. Let steep for 3-5 minutes, then push the plunger down to the bottom and pour the water into your mug.

Now here's the amazing part. When all that's left in my french press is soppy leftover herbs, I put the french press up to my face and take slow deep breaths and inhale that steamy herbal goodness. 

Y'ALL. This feels like the most amazing sensation I've ever experienced. Like better than drugs. I almost don't even want to drink the tea afterwards. Just give me that sweet sweet herbal steam. I literally felt like I was floating through the clouds in pure bliss. (Can you get high off of herbs?) This is compounded when you find herbs and flowers that you reaallly love the smell of. After you're sufficiently high, you can sit in a comfy safe space and drink your tea.

Hopefully someone actually reads this, ha. Let me know if you have any questions! If you're already a loose leaf tea drinker, let me know what you like to brew!"

1510,Anxiety,"I want to relax on my vacation, but I'm worried sick about my cat","I am going to be halfway across the US on vacation the next two weeks. The first six days my cat will be alone except a cat sitter who will visit once a day and then my mom will be living with her the following week.

I don't really know him, he was recommended by someone I trust a lot, but I have no reason to believe the cat sitter will have any issues taking care of my cat. But the moment I got on the plane, I started getting anxious and it's only gotten worse. My throat and chest have been tight, I've been shaking, and I feel like I can hardly breathe and it's just gotten worse now that it's late and I'm alone with my thoughts in bed.

I keep imagining coming back home to find her dead because the pet sitter forgot to feed her, or that I've emotionally scarred her forever because she'll be alone nearly 24/7 for 6 days with only a stranger to feed her. What if she thinks I abandoned her? What if there's a medical emergency? What if the petsitter doesn't tell me or do anything about it? He's the only one within hundreds of miles with the key to my apartment right now. I don't know anyone in the area except my therapist and former teachers, so there's not really anyone I could reliably use as a back up anyway.

I had to say good bye to my other cat as he was euthanized over a video call last year because my mom had procrastinated bringing him to the vet until it was too late, so in a lot of ways I'm still working through those emotions and I'm so scared of my still living cat dying young too. I've already been struggling a lot with sleep, I don't know how I can just lay down and relax tonight knowing my cat is all alone and anything can happen.

I know I'm being incredibly irrational and overly anxious, but I'm so worried something horrible will happen and I won't be able to do anything because I'm so far away.

Can anyone relate? I have a pet camera and I already requested the cat sitter to text me when everyday when she is fed. I feel like there's nothing else I can do besides trust the pet sitter for the next 6 days, but I don't know if I can calm down from this high anxiety until I'm in the same room as her again and can see that she is OK. Any advice?"
1511,Anxiety,Help,"So lately my stomach has been acting funny after i had a panic attack that lasted like 2 hours and it happened because i searched up stomach cancer and that fueled it up even more but i calm myself down by saying i dont have blood in my stools nor have i vomited blood or vomited at all in months and that happened like 2 to 3 nights ago and i think the panic attack affected my stomach in someway because when i want to eat i feel queasy like if im going to die while eating the food, before i would eat 3 slices of pizza but today i only ate 2 but yesterday i ate a normal plate of my usual amount of food but my stomach hurt a bit after but today i just ate only 2 slices of pizza, im not and adult as of yet but i feel like my panic attacks are becoming a bit more frequent"

1513,Anxiety,Constantly worried about my pets,"Long time lurker, first time poster.

I've suffered from GAD since I was actually a child. I remember waiting for the babysitter to pick me up in the 4th grade and being terrified she wouldn't show up and running through entire possible chains of events in my head. If my mom was late home from work I panicked.

I have a lot of trauma surrounding pets from childhood (grew up on a farm with typical farmer mentality about how animals are disposable.) I turned 30 today and have a 13 year old dog.

I am CONSTANTLY worried about his quality of life. I obsess non stop about his well being and happiness but also about his unfortunately looming death. He is healthy and happy and in great shape for his age but I just can't shake the feeling that I won't be ok withering him  and I am constantly worried about making sure he's living his best life, happy and spoiled.

I also have 2 cats who are younger (1.5) and my pet anxiety crosses over into my climate anxiety with them where I worry about their quality of life in 46 degree Celsius weather, potentially imminent food and water shortages  etc. I honestly think I'd rather kill myself and my pets than let them suffer, but in the meantime my obsessing over the mere possibility of this happening is impeding my ability to lead a normal life."
1514,Anxiety,Don’t you guys ever just hate living with anxiety…,"Of course it’s never ideal. But sometimes I feel like I can’t “forgive” myself for having anxiety. When I’m anxious about something, I tend to over explain *why* I’m feeling that way to the people close to me. No matter how much explaining I do, or how understanding they can be, it never feels like they fully understand. And it can be extremely frustrating, and alienating. It makes me feel like I’m destined to be misunderstood throughout my life. It sucks when I want to do something, but I feel like I can’t. Let’s say, friends make plans last minute, and I want to go, but I’m stuck thinking about what to wear, the drive there, what the parking situation is, how I’ll find the place, who exactly is going to be there, etc. etc. etc. and now, Covid is of course a constant going out worry too. Sometimes I can overcome these types of feelings, under the right circumstances there’s no worry at all, but other times I just can’t. And I feel so guilty, and like I’m literally battling with my own mind. Anxiety has caused to so many problems in my relationship and my friendships, even though my circle is extremely forgiving and understanding. It’s realistically my biggest “flaw”. I feel like they’ve accepted me as I am. But I’m just not there yet. I find myself wondering how anyone would be able to deal with me when I’m like this, when I’m spiraling, when even I don’t want to deal with it. I’m just venting but please share if you relate, or any tips on how to accept yourself outside of just coping with anxiety in day to day life."

1517,Anxiety,Breakdown over a leather couch,"This post is mostly a call for some emotional support regarding a decision Im less than happy with.

Background: I have been a vegetarian for ethical reasons for over four years now and have been on and off since I was a kid. No judgment to anyone who eats meat or animal products, but I dont. 

My girlfriend and I recently moved to a new state and are furnishing an apartment mostly from scratch. The first week has been very difficult: home sickness, living in a big empty space with nowhere to sit, and spending lots of money. Its progressively riled me up more and more as the days have gone on.

We went to Ikea today and found a couch we liked. We were both really excited and bought it without checking if it was real leather or fake leather. I assumed it wasn't real because it was on the cheaper side ($1400 for a big-ish couch) and it was from Ikea. But turns out its a mix, cushions are real leather, the body is fake.

And knowing that is bothering me **A LOT**.

I have never been an all-or-nothing type of vegetarian, I understand that living in the real world means that sometimes we cant always make the most ethical decisions. But I cant stop thinking about how I am sitting on a leather couch when we could have gotten a fabric version of the same model for less money. To try and clear my conscience I gave some money to the MO humane society, but I am having a hard time imagining getting this. My brain just won't let me relax.

I am considering returning it, but she really likes it, and I know that returning it and exchanging it for another would be a huge hassle. And I know that this is mostly an anxiety issue for me, so idk if giving into it and returning the couch is the best option.

Any support or advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated."
1518,Anxiety,Weird buzzing feeling in body?,"Hey everyone,
 
Earlier today I was in a movie theater which is where I tend to panic a bit due to the crowds, cramped spaces, etc. However, I’ve been getting better at managing my anxiety. The only weird occurrence was this ‘buzzing’ feeling I was getting all over my hands, chest, and face. This is pretty normal for me when I panic, but this time around I simply stood up and went to the restroom for a few moments (were talking, 3 minutes tops), and when I came back to my seat after this short break, the buzzing was gone and my anxiety was nonexistent. I went on to enjoy the full movie with no issues. My question is, has anybody else experienced anything like this? And how do you interpret/handle it?"
1519,Anxiety,currently panicking. no one to talk to.,"hi sorry for the formatting I'm on my phone in bed. but I've had awful panic attacks daily, yknow the whole deal; heart pumpin, nauseous, numb, sometimes I draw together like a dead spider and convulse.
I don't know how to help myself, the whole ""find 5 things you can touch"" technique has never worked for me and I'm awful at regulating my breathing. i feel like I'm about to die, and I'm hoping theres nothing physically wrong with me. I'm so tired, I just want a break. it's been like this for a month.

EDIT: I have an extreme fear of puking too (hurray me!!!) so when I get like this it's usually like a big cycle for hours of me panicking because i dont want to barf and getting nauseous because I'm panicking. I hate living like this lol... weed stopped helping a long time ago unfortunately, just got prescribed buspirone though and it's not doing much. fml"
1520,Anxiety,Anxiety easily turns to anger. Can't stop over thinking,"Does anyone else have this problem? I've had horrible anxiety for over 10 years, to the point where I don't like leaving the house and if I'm in a crowded place, I usually end up abruptly leaving. But on the other hand I get so frustrated about these thing's that I seem to have a hair trigger with anger. 

Just today my boss who is usually calm and chill, tried getting in my face and making me look small in front of my coworkers. I had felt anxious all day, but the second he did that, my anxiety turned to rage in what felt like a second. After I lost it on him, I felt myself shaking with rage for a good 15 minutes. Usually if something like that were to happen, my anxiety would of taken over and I probably would of went home. I've found myself a lot reveling becoming angry.

Plus now afterwards, I cannot stop dwelling on it and I'm loosing sleep over it. I feel like I dwell on everything that happens and it just makes my anxiety even worse. 

Can anyone relate to this?"

i ended up having a great shift! i didnt feel sick all day and i wasnt very anxious. Then I ended up letting my friend convince me to go out to a party tn, even tho i was tired and didnt want to but i went!!!! 

and GUESS WHAT!!! i hooked up with a dude!!!!! ive never done that before, its SUCH an anxiety inducing situation for me, but i did it! i had mediocre sex with a random guy, just like a normal person :’)

i know its weird to be proud of myself for having a hook up, but i am. Now im home, eating toast with nutella, drinking tea and watching a show. I had a good day. :) it really does gets better."
1523,Anxiety,Feeling anxiety about existence and death.,"Hello Reddit, I remember that I have thought of this since I was 12 or so, thinking about dying and about what happens after that is making me anxious 

It always starts with thinking about how life is something that will end for everyone at some point, then it continues with thinking about what happens right after you die, which leads to thinking about an empty space, without life, without anything at all, that's one of the things that makes me really anxious

Sometimes I also think about afterlife, stuff like heaven or hell, that makes me think if I should live my life connected to religion, if that would make me a better person and stop the anxiety of thinking about death

I think one of the things that scares me the most is that we know pretty much nothing about the end of life, everyone will face it but at the same time no one knows what will happen at that point

&amp;#x200B;

Im just looking for some advice to get over this, in the past it was easy to forget about it but now it's hard not to think about it everytime I go to bed or im in a silent place

1526,Anxiety,Unable to Distinguish Dreams from Reality,"Ok, so this has happened twice that I can remember since I started on Sertraline in April. 

1st time: My friend had a stroke. I had a hyper-realistic dream that he died while in the hospital. When I woke up, I was almost sure that I had actually been to the hospital and received the news of his death. I had like full memories. When I woke up, for a good 10 minutes I was able to walk around and talk to another friend. I asked about Dave (the guy that had the stroke), and she said that he was fine and recovering. 

2nd Time: I had a dream that I murdered two women and like chopped one up and put her in the freezer. When I woke up, I honestly couldn't remember if I had actually done that or if it was a dream. 

After typing that out, that makes me sound like a psychopath but I swear I'm just a normal dude. I've never hurt a person in any way or had any thoughts of doing so. 

I think I might have had a few similar experiences when I was a kid. There is this one particular...thought/sound/experience that I can hear in the back of my head sometimes when I'm trying to sleep. It is horrifying. I'm 21 and it still scares the shizz out of me. 

Also, I've been having random panic attacks when I'm alone. Like, I'll be just chilling, and suddenly feel this inescapable dread, fear, and panic. It feels like I'm dying. Worst thing I've ever felt in my life. It has happened about 5 times in the last few months. My psychiatrist doesn't seem too concerned. Not sure he fully understands what I mean. 

I feel like I'm going crazy. WTF."
1527,Anxiety,my anxiety is making me afraid of drinking water,"A couple of days ago I was home and I was drinking water. The last sip went in really fast, and I was coughing a lot. I breathe fine and everything but I'm afraid if I choked on water and now I am too scared to drink at all. I am very scared of choking and it affects how I eat and drink now. I wish it would stop."
1528,Anxiety,Had to leave work due to panic episode- feels like a failure :(,"(For a lil context- I have dealt with chronic mental illness for most of my life. A few months back it got so bad I was hospitalized for a week. Took a while to recover enough to be stable, but in the past few weeks, I was finally able to get a job and was feeling pretty proud of myself)

(Also apologies for the jumbled story, I will clarify anything if need be)

I woke up today feeling *off*. It’s such a familiar, unpleasant feeling. I use my coping techniques, take my meds, and try to push through it. The feeling never went away, but I had to go to work. I’m new so I don’t wanna be calling out yet, plus I did really wanna get through the discomfort. 

I’m there maybe an hour or two and I’m hit with panic. I’m crying, feeling like I’ll pass out/throw up, desperately trying to escape it. I call my manager over and tell her what’s going on. She is SO kind and understanding, takes me upstairs and says once I’m calm enough I can go home. Mentions her own struggles with anxiety and how she really doesn’t want me to feel bad about leaving.

Yet here I am feeling like an absolute failure. I’m scared I’ll lose control again and need hospitalization ($45,000 in debt from the last one. Insurance companies can stick it) and that just sends me into a tailspin. 

I know what I would tell someone who is going through the same thing, and the empathy I have for everyone who deals with crap like this; but I really need to hear it from someone else :( 

Thank you to anyone that even reads this"
1529,Anxiety,Why do I feel like this?,"I’ve been in an amazing relationship with this girl for about 7 months now and I’m happy 90% of the time. The other 10% I’m just not seeming to understand and I’m starting to feel like I’m insane. This girl has never given me a reason to feel like she’s cheating or talking to anyone else. I have her location, I can go through her phone whenever I please (even though I never do) I’m free to search anything I want of hers. But for some reason I constantly feel worried I’m not good enough or I don’t know, it’s just something. I feel like all this horrible anxiety comes back from this 4 year relationship I was in. My ex and I had a child and we were as happy as could be the whole time other than some casual arguments couples had, but nothing so serious. Well one day out of the blue I found out she was cheating on me and left me in the dust with nothing and got with the dude she was cheating with less than a week later. After that my whole life changed. I feel like I can’t be in a relationship without feeling like something is going to go wrong and I just won’t know about it. The amount of times a week I just sit in cloud 9 and think about all these things is bizarre and it’s driving me insane because I feel like I don’t understand it. I begin to feel depressed which effects my current girlfriend and she doesn’t understand why I feel the way I do. It’s so hard to explain what goes through my mind at times like these. I really just wish I didn’t feel like this anymore. I can’t talk about these things with my current girlfriend because she’ll think I’m trying to say I miss my ex which isn’t the case one bit. I love this girl so much but I feel like I’m not being the best I could be to her. I get scared and just want to break up sometimes just because I start to overthink little things. But I know in the end I don’t want to leave her, she’s so amazing and caring of me. I dont know man, I guess it’s just another one of those days. 😕"
1530,Anxiety,"Felt the switch flip between half asleep/tired to anxious, gosh I hate that. I freaking hate waking up like this every single day.","So here we go again gotta get through another day gonna be as always a slog. My honeybee did it, so I gotta do it cause the alternatives are not good, not in the slightest, hoping they hear my prayers as always. No use to anyone psychotic and hospitalised or dead."
1531,Anxiety,"I want what Ambien does with my anxiety but 24/7, not only when I'm about to sleep. What other medication does that?","I've done Klonopin and Xanan in the past and because it was incredibly addictive and I knew that the long-term damage in the brain would be irreversible I decided to quit.\*\*

Klonopin gives me a mellow and sweet feeling, but in the next day I feel super depressed. And Xanax never did anything to me besides brutally kill my appetite.

Ambien on the other hand... ignoring the part where we get crazy and do stuff that we will regret later, like texting an old crush and asking him on a date (yeah, I had the date... today, btw! oh well, it was fast)... so, what I was saying is that the good part of Ambien is that you feel some kind of freedom and a really peaceful state of mind.

LSD gave me the closest to what I should feel to be the happiest... but only during the trip. But then there's a problem: you can never know what your next trip will be like. And from paradise I went to pure nightmare (ER and shit). So I don't feel like trying it again even microdosing - same goes for shrooms. And weed... yeah, it's pleasurable and shit, but I don't know how it would be if I use it in long term.

I'm thinking more of a controlled substance for now, aimed for anxiety and is similar to what Ambien does. What do we have? I want to have my mind exactly like it is right now while I'm on Ambien: I feel that I can focus, study and the same time being super original e capable of relax whenever I can. The price is high and I'm not willing to pay: my memory and cognition means a lot to me."
1532,Anxiety,Is it normal to cry 10+ times a day,I used to never cry. Maybe once a month. Then once a week. Then i started crying everyday but usually i would cry once and after that i would feel better and my day would get a whole lot better but its come to the point where any time of the day i cry and it doesnt help me feel better anymore or it doesnt make my day feel better. I wake up crying and cry many times through the day and go to bed crying and feeling horrible. I feel so bad every day and every day i dont get happy. Usually I'll start off bad and crying and then ill get happy later on or its the other way round but now i just don't have any point in the day where im happy. And if i laugh i usually cry straight afterwards. Every day i cry alot and feel terrible. I dont know what to do and i feel hopeless
1533,Anxiety,I ain't well since I was 4,"I suffer from my mental health since I was 4 years old. Yes. Since I was 4 I had suicidal thoughts and an inferiority complex. I don't remember exactly when I started to feel like that but I remember that when I was 4 I already felt bad. They say it's not possible, but I remember. My first panic attack was at 7/8. I told my mom, but she said she was going to hit me and that I was supposed to stop ""the drama"" and go to sleep. I had insomnia from 11 to 13. Couldn't sleep, had panic attacks every day and walked around the house checking everything more than once for long minutes. I was afraid from something unknown. I just cried and hoped that would be over. At 23 I have intrusive thoughts. If I'm cooking dinner and cutting tomatoes, thoughts like ""put the knife in the belly"" or ""cut the hand off"" come up. If I am on the street: ""the car could run over"" and several other thoughts contrary to my nature. Not to mention that when anxiety hits, I have memory loss.  I've happened to forget my name, where I was and where I was going, on the street, twice. I cry if the house is dirty and messy.  I can't organize myself mentally and reading a book is sometimes difficult. I have to read the same verse more than once to understand, to be able to remember. I forget about everything too quickly. I always forget something. I'm afraid to ask for medicine or even pizza over the phone. I'm afraid of people, of being judged and being uncomfortable. Unreal fear. I don't know how to deal with people, I get sick."
1534,Anxiety,i hate being in this human flesh suit,the thought of people being able to perceive me and see what i look like makes me want to throw up every time it comes to mind. why do people have to see me even if it’s just a quick glance? what are they thinking of me when they look at me? are they judging my character? my brain explodes from thinking a million questions until i can’t even produce coherent thoughts anymore when i go outside and catch one pair of eyes looking my way
1535,Anxiety,Everyone hates me,"I dunno why it just hit me today. I know I’m particularly unstable right now so I don’t think I should trust my judgement currently but I feel like everyone hates me.
Rightfully too. I don’t reply to them for months, I’m selfish and make everything about myself and fail to be a good friend in the most basic ways. I find myself incredibly boring and uninteresting and couldn’t blame anyone for feeling burdened by talking to me at all. At the same time they care enough to keep talking and all I do is regress.
I’m self destructive and exhausting.
I keep feeling like everyone only tried bc they feel sorry for me. I feel I deserve to have been bullied and that I only wasn’t bc I’m too soft and weak that I was pitied too much to bully. I feel nobody trusts me and that my politeness is a cover and that I’m an attention seeker for trying to express myself and no one really likes me. I want to tell them I’m sorry but I feel that’s just trying to seeek attention too. I don’t have anyone I trust to talk to bc I’m convinced everyone finds me annoying secretly and sometimes not so secretly and I’m going to lose everyone. Everyone hates me. I think they talk to each other about me and say things behind my back bc they don’t really like me and they’re trying to leave me. I love them all so much but sometimes I think I put them on a pedestal but then if they don’t reply soon enough I hate them bc they hate me back but then I remember how loved I am but it can’t be real bc I don’t deserve love so I hate them and I hate me. I feel guilty for not loving them enough and mad for not being loved enough and mad for loving them too much.
How can I feel so strongly about both facts if they are paradoxical?
Kinda feels like I’m dying. Like my insides want to explode. I want to kill myself and everyone else."
1536,Anxiety,My girlfriend broke up with me,"I was in a relationship, my first ever, over the course of the past one year. It was an interesting time to get into one with the pandemic raging on and I thought I had met someone who will be with me forever. 

We used to talk for hours and I would share with her about how my anxiety, stress and self esteem problems are something I've worked on my, over the course of my 20s and now at 31, I feel that I'm in a better place in being able to identify these problems of mine, talk about it and deal with them. 

However, she would find it hard to discuss any emotional or mental health aspects about life at length, to her all these problems you deal within a day or two, and you march on being positive with life. I used to tell her that I almost always need time to deal with my issues and talking about it helps me deal with whatever it is I'm thinking. We work together as well so, she would see the side of me that gets frustrated with work or anxious when I had to a difficult task. 

There were fights where she would stop having a discussion if it went on about any topic for more than an hour, she would tell me she doesn't want to be in the relationship when ever things got even a little heated. Whereas I would never go there, I always wanted to keep the relationship going and figure out whatever it is we had a difference of opinion on. I would get on calls with my friends and cry about how I felt when she would do that to me, I would stress about it and be in tears cause I didn't know what I should do to make things alright and eventually I would be scared to bring up anything which I wanted to talk about, fearing my concern or opinion would make her feel uncomfortable and she wouldn't want to talk. 

However, I thought we would get by like this, grow and understand each other better. We constantly supported each other in our endeavors. But recently, she called me out for not being able to deal with my problems and change my behaviour in the one year that we dated. I told her that I have made strides to being better but it's not entirely fair to tell me that I should have solved all my mental health issues in a year. 

She refused to acknowledge that, she said she wanted to go back to being peaceful and not have to hear my problems. She asked me to give her space and then broke up with me over text. I pleaded with her to to be me a chance to speak to her but she kept insisting she didn't want that because she didn't want to fix this. I left her alone for a week, I spoke after that with her and she told me that she felt better not having to hear me at the end of the work day and was in a better space. It broke me to hear that and I was left wondering how and why she could suddenly sound like she wanted to do nothing with me. 

I had to move on after that and my anxiety would kick in randomly during the day and night. I kept crying and texting her seeking her attention but her responses were single words and sounded like someone I never knew. 

It's been a while now but I haven't been texting her, I occasionally wonder what she is up to or miss her when I'm alone. I can feel my chest surge with an emotional stress and I wish she would reach out to me. All this is even affecting my mental ability to put in the extra effort at work. 

I hope I can find the strength to cope with this and not fall down a pit of despair and sadness."
1537,Anxiety,Sources or tips for healthy coping mechanisms for unmedicated anxiety disorder?,"I have a friend currently undiagnosed, but im 80% sure has the disorder, since she manifests a lot of the physical symptoms like the attacks, difficulty in breathing, etc apart from her obvious mental health decline (possibly also has depression, has expressed suicidal thoughts a lot recently). She’s still trying to get herself an appointment for diagnosis, so as of the moment she’s unmedicated.

Her physical symptoms happen almost everyday at this point, and has been disruptive for her. I was wondering if anybody here can share sources which she herself can use to at least ease the symptoms? Or share your own coping mechanisms for when you were still unmedicated? 

Hoping for your advice!"
1538,Anxiety,How can I stop crying during and after my panic attacks?,It's almost like waves as one second I will feel in control and then randomly it hits and I start crying again. Then when I think it's over I cry. I work in retail so I don't really want to be crying Infront of customers so I go off and take a break which is a little issue as it takes like 30+ mins for this to stop. I'm there like I want to go back to work but then my brain goes nope let's cry again and it sucks.
1539,Anxiety,Messed up an online test due to anxiety,Even after studying.. unnecessary worrying which was out of my control has cost me another good Opportunity. I hope no one gets anxiety...  I feel terrible now
1540,Anxiety,Witnessing a tragic death,"A few weeks ago an incredibly tragic death happened at the flat where i live. A neighbour woman i knew from the 6th floor fell to her death and i was there to witness it. I heard her scream then i heard her hit the ground, and after that i saw her body. It was all an accident, not a suicide but after that day i've been feeling 100 times more scared, anxious. I'm having trouble realizing that everything around me is real, i feel like i'm playing a video game if that makes sense. Nothing feels real and i'm not sure what to do. I feel sick in my stomach, mind, heart when i think about this. I had death anxiety before this incident but now it's on a whole another level. Just wanted a place to vent i guess and hear other peoples thoughts, thanks for reading"
1541,Anxiety,Active vs passive negative feelings.,"I’ve been thinking about it recently and I realized there’s two types of negative feelings: active and passive. Active is things like anxiety, pain, fear, anger, annoyance. Passive is things like sadness, depression, boredom, and tiredness. 

After a whole year or more of experiencing passive negativity because of the covid lockdown, the last 2 months of active negativity have been 100x worse. 

I had a panic attack one day for no reason in the shower, and ever since that day I experience random pains and sensations in my head, chest, neck, and legs non stop.

I wish I could go back to just being sad I can’t see my friends. Now I feel like I’m always in danger and going to die. I can’t sleep properly anymore, I have to go walk around every 10 minutes to clear my head. It’s horrible. I wish I was just sad."

1543,Anxiety,Buspar/Hydroxyzine and alcohol,"I just was started on Buspar and Trileptal and have some big drinking milestones coming up in college life (boyfriends 21st, senior vegas trip, etc)...I drank with no change on Lexapro and hydroxyzine and they never did a thing to me and when I go out and drink like I go out and drink, I don’t want to really worry about this but I’ve recently for some reason developed major anxiety about meds? I literally had probably 8 drinks or so on both meds and they never did a thing to me but these are new meds. I’m not as worried about the trileptal, more the buspar, but I’m on a super low dose and am ofc going to consult with my doc about this, she knows I’m in college and I’m not ready to give up partying quite yet...any advice? I was told I could maybe skip the buspar for those days since I’ve gotten the anxiety pretty regulated now? Just looking for some advice, not really a rant- I know you’re not supposed to drink on any of these, but I still like to enjoy a good night out. Also for anyone out there concerned about drinking and hydroxyzine I swear I didn’t change a thing, had shots on it and everything, and it didn’t do a thing."
1544,Anxiety,Does anyone experience night panic attacks?,I am currently awake after waking up in the middle of the night in pure panic. It feels so overwhelming and presents mainly as nausea and fast heartbeat. It’s the second time this has happened. I am very familiar with daytime panic but it waking me up is a recent occurrence.
1545,Anxiety,Hyper-Awareness of being Conscious,"Hey there guys - I only use the trigger warning as this can trigger feelings of depersonalization. The point of this post is to create a discussion on the feelings of hyper-realization of being conscious. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to suffer from depersonalization  - real bad (if you know, you know). 

&amp;#x200B;

I've contained these feelings and learned how to deal with them. I guess containing isn't the word for this as that makes it worse so I guess I have fully relaxed into the idea that I am a human and stuck inside a human body. But, the awareness creeps up on me and causes anxiety from time to time. You could describe the feeling as a lucid dream-like state throughout your daily life. 

&amp;#x200B;

There comes a fear with this feeling for some reason, almost like a deep loneliness. But, through life and standing up everyday to the feeling of fear I have calmed my mind and would like to ask - anybody else feel like this? I'd love to talk about how everybody has been dealing with these feelings. 

Just want to end this read on one great note, which is to understand that behind this constant fight-or-flight headspace is to remember that your body stands perfectly fine and breathing - this is all in your head. You are fine!"
1546,Anxiety,How do you deal with Intrusive Thoughts?,"99% of Anxiety is caused by my consistent yet unwanted negative Intrusive Thoughts! When my Intrusive Thoughts reach its peak then my anxiety is also really bad to the point where I get really bad chest pain or experience derealization/depersonalization. But for those that don't know what Intrusive Thoughts are btw the quick google definition is, ""Intrusive thoughts are **unwanted thoughts that can pop into our heads without warning**,  at any time. They're often repetitive – with the same kind of thought  cropping up again and again – and they can be disturbing or even  distressing."" And that definition basically happens to me and I hate the feeling.  So what kind of advice do you guys have that have can help deal with such thoughts? Thank you and I appreciate any help."
1547,Anxiety,"Feeling sad, anxious and self-loathing when in a group","Does anyone else experience sadness, anxiety and self-loathing when they're out with a group? I always  get quieter in a group which makes me think i'm not fun enough which in turn makes me feel sad and hate myself. And because of that i get more quiet and a bit cranky and then i just want to go home and be with myself. It's really bothering me and i don't know how to stop it..."
1548,Anxiety,Anyone have techniques to lower anxiety?,"I’m 25(m) and I have a slightly higher than avg. level of anxiety normally or at least I think I do. Currently a 4 month break between my SO and I is coming to a close and I’ve only been able to sleep an hour at a time. I’m forcing myself to eat and my heart and chest have been building and building these last few days and now at the end of this where anytime she could text me to discuss things I’m about to explode.

I’ve been off and on crying these months and I can’t stop. I woke up today as we are supposed to talk in the beginning of august to what felt like a panic attack. 

I know that I need time and I need to breathe but I feel absolutely trapped and scared. I keep thinking I’m done crying but every week I discover I’m wrong. I wish there was something I could do to get myself to stop. I know life moves on either way things go between her and I but I’m failing to control this. I’m breaking and I’m not sure how to stop."
1549,Anxiety,Best medication/medical treatment for GAD?,"

I’ve been on several different anti-depressants for my chronic anxiety and depression but feeling like it’s not doing any good at this point. 

I’ve been on Citalopram for maybe over a year now and I literally feel nothing, I don’t care about anything or get excited or motivated about anything. So I weaned off them, talked to my psychologist about living life without any meds for a while to see how clear I could get my head. 
It’s been nearly a month with nothing and I’m the most anxious I’ve been since first starting any medication/therapy four years ago. 

 I can’t do anything outside of my home without feeling flighty and like everyone is watching me, I keep stuffing things up because I’m afraid of doing the wrong thing then I do it anyway. My relationship is a complete and utter mess because  I’m so overwhelmed by this feeling of anxiety and doubt. 

I went to my dr about maybe getting some beta blockers or anti-anxiety meds. He told me to go back antidepressants. I felt more anxious and on the verge of an attack. I don’t want to feel nothing again. I don’t want to gain more weight. I don’t want to have to wean off another drug that gives me brain zaps and dizziness and nausea. 

I feel so hopeless, like I have nothing to live for. What’s the point if living this way? I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to have to keep take these drugs that turn me into an obese zombie."
1550,Anxiety,Not sure what to do: just want someone to listen,"Hi everyone, I've been lurking this subreddit for a few months now, but this is the first time I've ever posted. Please let me know if there's something wrong within my post, thank you!

I'm a third year nursing student going on to my fourth year and for the past year, I've had this constant feeling of shortness of breath and palpitations. This was right in the middle of my clinicals in which nursing students go to local hospitals to basically shadow nurses and perform basic skills while monitored. At this time, the vaccine was not announced and I had relatives including my mom who were directly treating COVID patients. I was constantly under the fear of catching COVID from my shifts and passing it on to my family and I was socially isolated because I never went out unless completely necessary. I figured that these symptoms must have been related the stress of all this and that I would be better when I had my vaccine. 

Fast forward about six months later, and I was able to get both doses but my symptoms didn't stop. I started worrying that I had COVID myself, but I know I couldn't have as I had been properly following all guidelines. Other than the palpitations and the shortness of breath, I had no other symptoms like fever or sore throat. 

When I first had these symptoms, I first told my mom who is an ICU nurse. She told me that I was stressed and that it wouldn't last long, but now it's been months. I haven't told her that it's still going on because I've been told that I overreact how I feel. I've told her about my thoughts of possibly having some kind of anxiety disorder and seeking a diagnosis but both my parents agree that I shouldn't have anxiety because there's nothing to be stressed about and they're right. I have a home and I never have to pay rent, a loving family, a potentially stable career in the future, and friends whom I hold very close. This is also because my mom is caring for my grandpa who has cancer and I don't want to add to any stress she already has.

I don't know what to do. It's gotten to the point that I sometimes wake up and I feel like I'm suffocating. I can't fall asleep because the sound of my own heart beating keeps me up at night. I have crying fits about once a month for no real reason. And I don't want to say anything because everyone else has their own stuff to deal with.

I'm sorry if this post has been too wordy or difficult to understand. I actually made an appointment with my GP so that seems like a good first step. While I'm scared, I'm hopeful for the future and that I can finally put this behind me."
1551,Anxiety,I am drowning in my thoughts,"The title says it all I feel like I'm drowning. I regret EVERY single life decision I've made in the past year and all the consequences and problems hit me right now. I have been living in survival mode for so long. Always overthinking, always having panic attacks. The worst part is that I am alone. I do have family and friends, I tried to explain them that I am serious when I say I am nt doing well. But mobody takes me seriously. I just want to know if it will get better. Is there a guarantee that this suffering will end some day?"
1552,Anxiety,"Healthy anxiety kicking in, reassurance needed?","Yesterday i was bringing the washing in and something dropped to the floor, rather than picking it up slowly i threw my arm down to grab it like a jolt and in the process my forearm went really tingly. After that my arm felt heavy like someone is pressing down on it and feels a little shaky and in certain positions i get pins and needles. This was at 5 yesterday, i still feel the same now but maybe i just need to recover… i might have just shocked my arm into something it wasn’t expecting. I still have feeling in it but just feels weird compared to my other. My health anxiety isn’t helping things either haha."
1553,Anxiety,How to survive a two week quarantine alone?,"I'm moving country in a few weeks and will need to do two weeks of isolation in an apartment by myself due to the pandemic and I'm freaking out.

I'm moving for work and when I took the job I was in a very good place mentally. The last two years have been the best of my life. I felt strong and confident, ready for anything.

Two weeks ago I had a relapse (I have OCD and intrusive thoughts) and I've been an anxious wreck since. I'm losing weight and wake up in a panic every morning. The rest of the day is then miserable.

I'm worried I'll get even worse being on my own and stuck inside for two weeks in a new country. 

I'm looking at going back to see a counsellor next week in person and then continue online.

The thought of moving and being alone in isolation is now incredibly daunting. But it's a good job and something that I really wanted to do until I had a relapse.

What would you do in my position?"
1554,Anxiety,Does anyone else get a shortness of breath and starts shaking?,"I’ve been studying for an exam since a week ago and it’s been getting in my head especially thinking on my plans for the future and adulting in general. This is my first time experiencing this symptom unlike before when I used to feel chest pains thats hurt whenever I would think of something worrying (almost anything, thoughts like “Did I forget my money” or “Crap I have to to go to the dentist this weekend”) especially if it’s something stressful that started since I was in 9th grade.

It just happened earlier when I was on my phone thinking about the possible outcomes of my exam (whether or not I should be studying instead of taking a quick break) and suddenly I start sweating and just start getting a shortness of breath. I got up from my bed and went to turn on my electric fan so I could breathe properly and sat down in-front if it. I start to notice that my hands were shaking and it made it harder for me to type on my phone when I was about to message a friend. It happened for a short while but I just want to know if anyone else experiences this."
1555,Anxiety,Why does my anxiety get worse during night time?,"During the day I’m fine, no panic attacks, nothing too bad. But during the night I have to be careful to not spiral into a full on panic attack and get this horrible cold feeling in my forehead. It makes it hard for me to sleep and I’m not sure what to do."
1556,Anxiety,"I got my GAD treated, but years later I feel like I have a different form of anxiety.","I used to have a lot of anxiety in social situations, I would feel very nervous walking past groups of people and fear them judging me. If I wanted to talk to someone new I wouldn't because of fear of being judged. I would over analyze a look that I got from someone, or their tome when they were speaking to me. I also had anxiety when doing other simple day to day things. For example I could be driving with someone in passenger seat, and overanalyze where I placed my hands on the steering wheel. My mind knew it didn't matter, but my body would react as if it were a life or death decision.

I got diagnosed and treated, which allowed me to feel comfortable around people, and gave me the ability to speak to anyone I wanted to without much fear. I no longer felt like simple day to day tasks were so serious, and overall I felt like my anxiety was fixed. But now a few years later, I feel a different type of anxiety. I find myself replaying social situations over and over in my head after the fact, and analyzing how others reacted to my presence. I'll replay something small like how a person I was speaking to looked away for a second after something I said, then come to the conclusion that they probably don't like me that much. Or I'll replay conversations I had in the past day, week or month, and wonder if I was being awkward, or if I said too much or revealed too much information. I know that its usually irrational, but I still feel the anxiety."
1557,Anxiety,I’m overwhelmed by my own existence.,"As far back as I can remember I’ve always had issues such as existential anxiety and depersonalization. I found it more entertaining as a child, but as an adult it’s horrifying and right now it’s worse than ever. 

The fact that I exist terrifies me, it’s put a mental block on everything I used to enjoy. It makes everything feel utterly pointless and bizarre, but at the same time it doesn’t feel like depression does. It’s different than depression. It’s more a feeling of utter discomfort and confusion that I can’t quite understand. 

What I can say is that it’s the loneliest feeling I’ve ever experienced, and seeing other people walking around happy and content makes me worse because I’m like, am I missing something? We’re all here and existing without any sense or explanation and then we’ll all be gone and nobody seems to be bothered by this? It hangs over me like a dark and sinister dread and literally sucks the joy from everything, petrifying me!!!"
1558,Anxiety,How can I get an SSRI?,"Hey guys, I have a problem. I have anxiety/depression and really want to try an SSRI. I was going to try Hims but I leave for an apprenticeship school this week and can't wait for something to be shipped to me. Are there any relatively inexpensive telehealth services that I can get a script sent to a local pharmacy?"
1559,Anxiety,The most stressful morning!!,Worried so much about my honeybee 🐝 got myself in a right state just calming down now!!!
1560,Anxiety,How to deal with completely irrational/anxious thoughts at night?,"I have a lot of anxiety at night these days, due to thoughts that are totally irrational and wouldn't scare me so much during the day, such as:

\- Time is moving way too quickly, and I'm missing my life

\- I woke in a panic realizing I have a new health insurance policy and I am unfamiliar with the copays 

\- I remembered an email I got saying my google storage was about to be full. When I got the email I barely cared about it, but for some reason when I remembered this in the middle of the night I was panicking. I woke up thinking.... wtf?? WHY did this bother me at all!?

There's more but this is the gist. I get these thoughts that don't really affect me during the day, but at night I wake up panicking about them!

I've started to become aware of this in the night, that the thoughts I'm having aren't real. BUT the physical symptoms still linger: feeling I want to crawl out of my own skin, tossing and turning, cannot relax, etc. Deep breathing doesn't really help, as my mind goes straight back to the thoughts. 

I'm really struggling. If you guys have any behavioural changes, some concrete actions I can take in order to help please let me know !!"
1561,Anxiety,Anxiety about being hungry,"So I’ve been having this issue where instead of eating because I’m hungry, I eat in anticipation of being hungry because I don’t want to get too hungry and overeat. It ultimately leads to me overeating and kind of defeats the whole purpose. I’m literally afraid to be hungry because I know I overeat when I am too hungry, but my fear is causing me to overeat 😭"
1562,Anxiety,Any med students that can help me?,"So the reason I’m posting this on here is cuz people are more understanding and nicer than in other more general subs and this is more of an anxiety issue. 

My nose cartilage was injured and so it moved in slightly making there look like there’s a dent just before the tip of my nose. It’s small but it’s been bothering me. I’ve seen a doctor and only option I have are fillers but apparently they are risky. 

I was wondering, since nose cartilage can grow and change... is there any hope that my nose will smoothen out a bit or that some cartilage will move back or grow? A small change would make it look better.

But please!!! If you only have bad news I’d rather you don’t comment because my anxiety can’t handle it. 

If you have anything that could make me more hopeful please let me know. My doc did say there are people whose noses continue to settle a year later (it’s been 10 months for me) but didn’t specify why"
1563,Anxiety,On my way to my first date in 4 years,"Really freaking out but proud of myself. I can do it, just god please help me so that i dont get panic attack."
1564,Anxiety,Anxiety with starting a new full time job since 3 years ago.,"Hey guys, im afraid of starting work again for full time, i want to work but i wanna fight the fear of getting fired on the first day or quitting on the first day (cause thats what i did), i want to start my first year apprenticeship as a spray painter (painting cars fyi), ive learnt it at school and at home and know the basics, but i dont wanna stuff up when im in the workspace, i also wanna fight the fear of getting anxiety before getting ready to leave for work, ive had anxiety for 3 years and would love some help, and i also dont wanna take anti depresents cause they don't work. Many thanks ✌️"
1565,Anxiety,Feeling super exhausted from anxiety/panic?,"This whole week I’ve been stressed out and get anxious. Have had a few anxiety attacks and one panic attack this week. All from me worrying constantly about health stuff even after so many doc visits and so many tests, all normal. I still worry. I also get anxious anytime I feel tired/sleepy idk why.

Anyways today I’ve been worrying about a on/off headache in the forehead area. I’ve also been feeling super tired like I could sleep all day kind of tired but can’t do that cause of anxiety. Could this be from panicking on/off all week? Like the exhaustion &amp; stuff

Does anyone else get like anxiety hangovers for a few days?"
1566,Anxiety,Feeling anxious about new management promotion,"I’m really struggling with this. I’m a high performer at work (probably in part due to my anxious nature). My boss is being let go tomorrow and I’m being asked to step in and take his place. My coworkers love my boss, so I’m afraid they will all take this very hard and possibly quit. With this being my first management position, I feel really anxious about this whole situation. 1) I am being asked to take on a lot, immediately. 2) We will already be understaffed with me taking over my boss’s position, and if other people quit we will get even farther behind. 3) My anxiety is giving me imposter syndrome and I’m wondering if I made the right decision to take this. 

The other option was to hire someone from Indeed to be our new manager and I would have stayed in the same position. So either way, my boss is being let go.

Does anyone have any words of encouragement or advice?"
1567,Anxiety,I can not believe how far I've come in a few short years!,"I moved to a new country with my boyfriend 10 months ago and we haven't been able to see either of our families because of covid and we are both close with our families.
I suffer from really bad anxiety and he has even done courses to understand it more so he can support me!

One of my biggest fears when moving was falling into a bad place again and not being able to get our of it, particularly because we moved during the pandemic, needed to find jobs and its our first home together! Naturally I thought of every single bad thing that could happen.

It hit me recently how far we've come together but particularly how far I've come! Moving country and taking away everything that was ""safe"" meant i could really understand myself and what effects my anxiety, if it's bad seeing how I can help myself and be nice to myself and not my own worse enemy! I'm also in the gym, and have a full time job where I can build an INSANELY good career and intend to be manager by christmas. 

I can actually see a future and let me just say it looks very amazing!

For reference, 4 years ago I physically could not go anywhere without someone with me and it has taking me what feels like a lifetime but I have got here and I'm so happy!"
1568,Anxiety,Ako lang ba?,"Hindi ko na alam ano gagawin ko. Buhay ko ba talaga ito? Gusto ko ng sumuko. Pagod na ako.

Ginagawa ko nman ang lahat. Pero bakit parang kulang pa? Ang trabaho ko mas madami pa sa kanila. I also work twice as much as them. Pero kulang pa din. Hindi pa rin sapat lahat ng ginagawa ko.

Ang sakit sa dibdib isipin na kahit anong gawin ko, I will not be good enough for them. Lahat ng ginawa ko, hindi nila nakikita lahat ng efforts ko. 

Baka mas madali kung magpakamatay na lng? Kasi mas madaling umalis ng hindi nagpapaalam. Mas madaling umalis ng walang explanation. Kasi nga dba? Lahat ng galaw mo may explanation.

Bakit ka aalis? Sayang yang trabaho mo. Hindi basta basta ang makapasok dyan. Sayang ang opportunities. Hindi madali maghanap ng trabaho. Sayang ang pinag aralan mo. 

Sayang. Yan lng naman ang alam nila. All they see ay kung ano ang mawawala sa iyo. Hindi nila alam ano pinagdadaanan mo. Kasi kahit anong sabihin mo, ang makikita at makikita lng nila ay ang mga bagay na masasayang mo. "

1570,Anxiety,I might have hypothyroidism and I'm a hypochondriac....,"I recently got a battery of tests done and it turns out I have abnormally high TSH levels of about 7.84. Which indicate hypothyroidism. :/

I've been so anxious, I'm going to see a doc ASAP. My mom has thyroid problems as well. It's just so scary. I don't want to be infertile or put on lots of weight.

It makes me so sad. I cried the whole afternoon and I just want to die. I had a particularly bad day and I just do not want to be stuck with a disease my entire life. Especially one that might cause me to be infertile."
1571,Anxiety,Man I’m dating complimented another girls eyes whilst I was there ?,"So don’t get me wrong this guy complemented my eyes a while ago whilst he was on magic mushrooms but I did ask him “ what do my eyes look like when you on magic mushrooms “ 
And he hyped me up 

Few weeks later I told him my eyes are an insecurity of mine so don’t compliment another girls infront of me cause it really hurts anyway next day he does magic mushrooms and without this girl asking he starts complimenting her eyes I distracted myself cause I knew what was happening and he comes up to me and says “ don’t be mad “ with a big grin on his face. 
I’ve not taken mushrooms so I don’t know what visuals it changes 
Cause they nothing special so must be once hell of a drug but it’s why did he choose her and not me, am I overthinking this I know I am but that’s what I do he tried to make it right by hyping me but only cause I asked for it like I want it to be natural if he’s going to do it not forced.
Please can someone help me change my perspective of this cause it’s really hurting and the anxiety is so intense"
1572,Anxiety,Ended a good relationship,"I ended my relationship with my partner on Friday and I can’t stop thinking about him. 

I came to the decision after realizing that I wasn’t my best representative in my relationship. While no one is perfect and I’m trying to not idealize my partner, it really wasn’t anything they did that pushed me to ending the relationship. 

I just was overcome with guilt that I essentially let my anxiety become a 3rd person in our relationship and now that was affecting not only myself but him as well. I realized that I needed to take a long pause to really really work on learning to live with my mental health struggles and process past trauma that I just haven’t spent time to reflect on. 

I miss him so much, like it’s eating me alive. But I just knew he deserved better than what I could give him at this time. I’m just so hurt that I hurt someone I love so much and I’m not sure what to do. Part of me wants to beg him for other chance, another part of me thinks I was right in me decision to let him go. 

The good thing is, he understands and wishes me the best. Hell he even went ahead and said that he didn’t have anything bad to say about me and that he felt like this was a “see you later” and not a “goodbye”. 

But I feel like I lost “the one” for me and that sucks. I hate my anxiety. I hate it so much and I just wish I could rip it out myself."
1573,Anxiety,"Does anyone have ""Imposter Syndrome""? And if so, how do you cope with it?",
1574,Anxiety,Health anxiety + pfizer vaccine,"So, three days ago i got my first shot of the pfizer vaccine, i had a lot of anxiety at the thought of taking it since it's a new vaccine and i have health anxiety. I read about the vaccine before i went to take it and read that a (very small) number of males under 30 has gotten myocarditis after their shots.

Now i can't stop thinking that i will get it and die if i go and exercise. Before the shot i exercised between 5-7 days a week( i compete in thaiboxing). I could use some help getting over my fear, i know its a SUPER small amount of people getting these severe reactions but i just can't stop thinking that i will get it. I saw some recommendations to rest for a week after getting the pfizer vaccine in case you get myocarditis.. but i really want to keep exercising. This is also making me not want to take my second shot."

1576,Anxiety,"After Three Months, I've finally been able to speak again. Now to spend five more months dealing with social anxiety...",
1577,Anxiety,My boyfriend is moving away and i don’t know what to do,"I’ve been living with my boyfriend at his parents house for over a year now and we are completely in love, this is the healthiest relationship I’ve ever been in. Unfortunately because of my own mental health and bad habits, I think I’ve become unhealthily attached. He is moving a few hours away for school and I will be staying here. The past few days when I’m alone i just start crying so much that I can’t even calm myself down, I started doing grounding techniques which will help in the moment and then I start spiraling again until i’m crying for what feels like forever. 

I haven’t talked to him specifically about this level of anxiety I’m having because I don’t want him to feel like he should stay home for me or feel held back at all. He does know that it sucks for both of us and he gives me the reassurance like we’ll visit all the time, we’re ganna be ok etc. 

Partially my anxiety is of the typical long distance anxiety, what could happen when we don’t see eachother all the time? 

The main part of my anxiety is that I literally go to work and just look forward to coming home to him everyday, I don’t really have any friends that live nearby and I don’t know the best ways to make friends as I’m mostly introverted until I’m already comfortable with someone. I can spend time with family but they just make me feel stressed as they always have some kind of drama. I could just work more but then I get in this spiral is that all life is, go to work and go home repeat? I just feel like I’m going to go into a depression when he leaves and I don’t want to do that but it’s already starting. I feel like I’m not going to have anything to look forward to everyday and that scares me. 

So any advice on what I can do to overcome this overwhelming anxiety 😩

My therapist was suggesting to find new hobbies but she just left her practice so I’m out of a therapist and I’m not really sure what hobbies I would enjoy"
1578,Anxiety,Wish I hadn’t told my mom what happened,I was doing better on my own lol. Now she just triggers me every day by trying to dig if she thinks I’m remotely down or even apathetic. I try setting boundaries and she just doesn’t fucking get it
1579,Anxiety,I can't think when I'm anxious,It's so bad. I have a hard time thinking when I'm nervous. I don't know what to do or how to fix this. My family has noticed it. Is this normal or can someone give me some advice?
1580,Anxiety,I feel like Girlfriend will leave if I don't tell her every last issue I have.... #Anxiety issues #Dating,"So I have a few anxiety disorders.

Started dating great woman (so far lol) and I keep feeling the anxiety to tell her more and more of my negative traits and issues, she far she is understanding. But I keep coming up with new things to mention to her that are possibly ""issues"" I have lol...it's not ideal.

I need to focus on the positive and good things. But my anxiety mind is like ""make sure to tell her this also or it could come up someday and 5 years later she will leave you because you forgot to mention this"".......which I get is not realistic.

But like, do most people just keep things in and if issues arise later they arise etc and worked out then?

I used to not think of this stuff when dating but have anxiety disorders now (OCD, Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder.. (yes they are treated and on meds and I have a therapist, and Girlfriend is aware of that)......

&amp;#x200B;

But yeah I need to figure out how to stop my mind from feeling anxiety if I don't say every last thing and ""get it all out on the table"" so to speak of all my dumb issues.....very annoying:) I'm sure for her and me.

Therapist says ""you don't need to tell her every last negative or issue you have"".......but my mind says ""if I don't then she will leave etc if she finds out I wasn't 100% honest about every last thing""......I love anxiety......:)"
1581,Anxiety,Sweaty hands,"Whenever my anxiety kicks in my hands get super sweaty. It gets so bad I can’t even pick something up without it getting soaked or slipping out of my hand. I’ve tried washing my hands constantly, putting my hands in front of a fan or AC but it just keeps coming. The only thing that seems to help is high alcohol hand sanitizer which dries it out for a bit but even then it doesn’t last long so I keep putting on more and more and it makes my hands break out in a bad rash. Does anyone else have the same problem and can anyone recommend anything to help?"
1582,Anxiety,Someone broke into my house and I'm freaking out.,I had someone break into my house this morning while me and my kids were sleeping. I woke up and he was sleeping on my sofa. It scared the shit out of me even though he was just drunk and didn't hurt us. The cops took him home and we didn't press charges.  When I remember It happening I freak out all over again. I have therapy and emotional regulation class tomorrow. How do I get through today? How do I sleep tonight? I'm already a super anxious and paranoid person to begin with now I feel like my fears have been validated
1583,Anxiety,Are there ways to reduce the side effects of anti-depressants?,"I've been taking these antidepressants...

1. Venlafaxine for almost 1.5 years (Two 75mg pills(150mg total) every night)
2. Trazodone for 1 year (25 mg every night at the start, now 12.5 mg every night)
3. Lorazepam for 6 months (1 mg every night at the start, now 0.35-0.5 mg every night)
4. Fludiazepam for three weeks(0.125 mg to 0.25 mg every night)

* I've noticed that I have trouble recalling familiar things...  
Example : The name of my second drug (Trazodone) although I have been searching it on the web for information more than 10 times in the past year.  
(Are these signs of Alzheimer's?)
* My daily habit is very fragile, muscle memory is very hard to form.  
Sometimes I just suddenly forgot what I am doing, I either find a lead/hint for what I am doing earlier or I just lost it, completely.
* I can recall most of the old memories(before I started taking antidepressants) but now I have trouble recalling long-term memories after taking those.  
I'm also diagnosed with bipolar II three weeks ago, and I think I am having mixed episodes right now, sometimes I can recall everything I was doing for the day, sometimes I forget everything.  


Does meditation help, which kind of meditation should I try?  
I tried coffee while I am down but I think it enhances my anxiety(Nope, not taking coffee anymore)  
I am also very curious about how these antidepressants do with my brain, is there an interesting book where I can start off? (I'm a chemistry major, so studying these brain chemistry/biochemistry increase dopamine in my nerd brain, just kidding)"
1584,Anxiety,I may need a new dentist,"I suffered from several undiagnosed mental illnesses for decades until being diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder w/ frequent panic attacks, persistent depressive disorder, OCD, ADHD, emetophobia, etc. I am now 45f. 

I basically spent close to 2 decades in a state of disassociation. I have lots of missing memories, my health is in the toilet, but for the purposes of this post, I let my dental health completely slide. 

Now that I’m getting proper treatment, I’m doing my best to take care of the physical issues. Now, when I was researching local dentists, my search parameters were hampered by my crap insurance, but I did my best to find one with positive reviews from patients. 

Unfortunately, I’m not sure if this dentist is the right fit for me. Upon my very first visit, and subsequent visits, I have been VERY clear that I have very bad anxiety in this environment in particular. Always have. 

During my last visit, my anxiety was pretty intense. Even though I had taken Xanax before my appointment, I still had a panic attack in the chair. I was very clear with the dentist as to what was happening. It was kind of obvious as I was visibly shaking. 

I was met with impatience, the dentist scolding me by saying that he “can’t work with a moving target”. 

It bears repeating here that I could not stop shaking. Because I was having a panic attack. He ended up leaving a small cavity only partially finished. 

I don’t think I can go back."
1585,Anxiety,"I'm 30 male, my whole adult life I've had a strange mental block which held me, whenever i sit at the table in order to do productive things (not play games) my anxiety and panic slowly spikes up to the point i can't focus and think, so i have to abandon it."," 

What's frustrating is that I'm pretty capable, was always considered smart everywhere i worked, by friends etc, had good ideas that helped people, solved problems. I am sure I'm much more than who i am in life right now, but because of my problem whenever i sit to work on something that will bring me money or some other assets. And the older I'm getting the more it frustrates me that I'm capable but i just can't, i physically can't do it. It takes me tremendous amount of motivation or extreme pressure or outside danger (like going broke next month if I don't do it) to do anything. And if i try to do it without extreme circumstances it takes just few minutes to build up enough frustration to leave the task and go do easy things, games, youtube, food etc.

What's weird is that what I'm trying to work on is not an alien thing to me, i like it, i see how i can add value, make really useful things, for many people in fact. Sometimes I'm amazed how effective that mental block is, it's like my brain doesn't allow me to do things when I'm sitting at the table, but the moment i leave my table and lay down on my bed the block lifts and I'm actually able to do it without accumulating frustration. This very post i couldn't write when i was sitting, but look at that wall of text, because I'm on my bed.

I also had problems sitting at the table at school etc, always fidgeting and sleepy. But i wasn't considered a bad student, because i had enough brains to do what was required last minute. From what i can remember there was a traumatic episode when I changed school because my parents moved a lot. When i was brought to new school and sat at the table with new class and all strangers around me, i had a full blown panic attack and ran out and asked to never come back there. Would that really be the reason? I don't know what to do. I can't work from bed all the time, it gets uncomfortable after some time and you know beds weren't designed to be a workplace.

Sometimes it's getting ridiculous, every now and then i see opportunities to make tens or even hundreds of thousands dollars, but i can't, my brain literally blocks me from it almost as fast as i sit at the table.   


Forgot to add that i have a short window of clear thinking wihout anxiety when i wake up and if something breaks it - it stays for the rest of the day.  
It's hard to reset back, a nap or weed helps (tested recently).

Phew... what a vent..."
1586,Anxiety,Shaking,So about 2 weeks ago my anxiety went thru the roof. I’ve dealt with anxiety since 13. Now 30. All because I took prednisone. I’ve never felt anxiety so bad. It’s calmed down a lot but I’m shaking when it’s time to go to bed and when I wake up. I can go all day fine with almost no anxiety but for some reason night time and waking up is so bad. Does anyone else deal with the shakes from anxiety?!? It makes me think there’s something else wrong with me even though I was just at the ER and everything came back fine.
1587,Anxiety,I don’t like having friends.,"I like my friends - they care about me and have been there for me through my darkest times. What I don’t like is getting really anxious and feeling like they are going to be mad at me if I don’t want to go out and do anything. I feel like I have to come out with an excuse good enough for them to not get upset about me wanting to hang out with them. Why can’t it just be as simple as I’m tired or how about this, I don’t want to? I like staying at home. I like getting to bed at a decent time and waking up feeling refreshed. When we do hang out we talk about things that make me anxious anyways. I feel like since they know about my anxiety and depression they should understand this. I don’t get upset if people don’t want to hang out, I respect that. I always point this out to them and they say “We get upset because we like having you there”. Anyways - it’s mentally exhausting and I’m always, always worried about them being mad at me. I feel like it would just be easier to not have friends. Why does my brain cause everything to bother me so much? But hey, that’s anxiety for you. I know I’m probably not the only one that experiences this so any advice feel free to share!"
1588,Anxiety,“And then meds and therapy made everything better”,"That’s great that it did for you. But hearing that is soul crushing for those of us who it hasn’t, and being told over and over we’re just not trying hard enough when we’re fighting every day.

That doesn’t mean we tried one therapist or one medication and gave up. But life is relentless for some, and fighting every day to get knocked out, well, it gets harder and harder to stand back up. That’s what happens in the boxing ring, and it’s applicable to fighting for our mental health too."
1589,Anxiety,My medication stopped working :( I don’t want to go through this again.,Feeling this horrible gut pain and anxiety just wanting to vomit 24/7 😭 the bad thoughts race in my head. I don’t want to keep fighting this demon!
1590,Anxiety,Do I have anxiety?,"Sometimes there’s littles stresses that lead to me getting lack of sleep, breathing deeply, and feel fearful such as school, work, or fear of anything new happening. However, there are moments where I randomly wake up, not knowing the cause, and my chest feels heavy, it feels like a rush through my body, and I still feel panicky and difficulty breathing. I don’t want to seem like I’m over thinking, but my body just never seems to be relaxed and at ease and I always feel like I’m living in this world of fear. What is y’all’s opinion? 😬❤️"
1591,Anxiety,"Anyone tried antidepressants other than Zoloft? If so, has it helped?",Today I feel super anxious. I feel like I need to yawn but I can’t so I keep thinking that something bad is going to happen to me if I don’t yawn. almost like if I’m not getting enough air. Tomorrow I’m going to make an appointment with my doc to see if there’s any meds than can help with anxiety other than Zoloft. (I’ve been on Zoloft for 2 years and didn’t help much.)
1592,Anxiety,Does too much down time cause anxiety to increase?,"Hi 24/f i’ve been out of work since last summer due to covid and my anxiety has been through the roof. I stay up late and then stay in bed until afternoon, stare at my phone for a good 7-10 hours a day on social media. When I’m not on my phone I read a lot and whenever the weather allows I try and get outside for some exercise by taking a walk and getting some sun. I pretty much only see my mom and my boyfriend each day but I never go a day alone. However, when I am with my boyfriend we just eat dinner and then watch TV until bed. The weather has been bad the last week and it’s been impossible to get outside and do anything so I’ve just been sitting on my phone or reading or watching tv for about 4 straight days now. Tonight I just started feeling a lot of derealization like I wasn’t full present and just lost in my brain. I felt like the line in my head between reality and like book and tv show characters just feels blurred. Like i’ve spent more time thinking about that stuff because I don’t want to be left alone with my own brain and the anxiety. This all of course has prompted me to be anxious that I’m losing touch with reality and going crazy (a long time fear of mine). So I guess my question is does this much time doing nothing make anyone else anxious and is it normal to feel like this? thanks"
1593,Anxiety,Dimenhydrinate for Anxiety,"I've been taking dimenhydrinate (gravol where I am. Dramamine in the us) lately for anxiety and panic attacks because I cant afford prescription meds. It makes all my anxiety go away and i can actually function as a human. 
I dont take it every day, maybe one pill once every few days if I start to feel anxious or get stuck in a panic attack. Just cause I'm in such a rough patch with my panic disorder right now..
 Is this ok?"
1594,Anxiety,Looking for some help.,"Hello, i had muscle twitching for a month now and its freaking me out. Got an EMG and it came back clean but im still scared cause the muscle twitching,pain,tightness is still going and now my left foot feels weird. Has anyone had these symptoms? Thank you."
1595,Anxiety,Venting and Seeking Help,"I don't know how to move forward in this world. I know none of you are my therapist, but if you're willing to listen please grant me that. I never had a therapist, nor friends who would care, bar one but they're dealing with their own troubles and have no time for mine.

I turned 22 a little over a month ago and I haven't done a damn thing. I missed out on my formulative years cause I was too busy playing games, watching videos, and panicking whenever I was around people. It was seriously the most pathetic thing. Thing is, I wanted desperately to talk with my classmates and put myself out there. I wanted to be confident, and I never hated a single person around me. Only myself. I was lightly bullied by a lot of people who targeted me for seemingly no reason, other than that I was weak and an easy target.

There's a few instances I still remember, such as when one of my classmates told me ""nobody wants you here"" out on the basketball court during gym class, in front of everybody, and nobody said a thing. Even the teacher ignored it. I stood there, wandering back and forth for about a minute trying to get any kind of attention, but nobody said a thing. I walked back towards the school building, which was a good eigth mile away, visible right from the court. I walked slowly and nobody, not even the teacher stopped me or said anything. That was the first time I felt that alone, that was 7th grade. That year, little stuff happened all the time, but my mind's repressed most of it. I remember though, one time on the bus back home, a bunch of kids were calling out to me from the back. I wish I responded, they went on for a while. I was too scared.

I looked back at all these types of events last week, and I discovered it happened usually once a year with a different person. I'm not one to hold onto that shit, so I forgave them all, especially since it never got too serious, which I'm thankful for. However, I think the mental toll has been paid, and I'm pretty fucked cause of it.

A life of failure and disappointment later, me abandoning people I loved to talk to, me cutting ties, me being lazy and not taking action when I need to, all led to me being here now. A 22 year old nobody, no direction, nobody who will give me an objective, straight answer, no relationship experience, no money, nothing to show and already feeling like I'm in the shoes of a geezer.

I still have my dreams though, so many dreams. Like most other people, I would give so much just for a chance to go back and do it again, but who says it wouldn't just end up the same way? Two of my biggest insecurities were my *name* of all things, and my appearance. I was an ugly kid, a little better off now but not by much. So, realistically, my only choice is to carve forward. Still, I can't talk to people despite trying so, so hard, I have no confidence in myself whatsoever. Seriously, I don't know if it's the mild porn addiction, the lack of support or successes or whatever, but my confidence is through the damn floor. I know I'm self aware in most things, though I'm sure I got a million blind spots too, but the things I see are torturing me endlessly.

I want so many things in life. I want to move to San Francisco, finish off my (planned) last two years of college there, try to put myself out there one last time. I want to spend nights with a small group of friends by the beach and dock, in the city just enjoying life. I want to learn to skateboard. I want to learn Jiu Jitsu to gain some confidence, and to be able to protect myself and others, at least a little. I want to learn to make comics or manga or anything of the sort, and put what I have in mind into reality. I want to further my programming and finish my game I've been working on for the past year. I want to start a YouTube channel so I'd always have people to talk to who were interested in the same stuff as me, so I'd have an outlet to just talk. I want to be more confident. I want to be unreasonably confident. I want to put myself out there every chance I see a positive outcome from, even if it's a gamble. I want to be kind to everybody, regardless of my political beliefs. I want to help people just cause. I want to live an adventurous life. I want to fall in love. I want to start a family, raise 4+ happy kids in San Fran, send them to school and teach them to be strong and wise, and to enjoy their lives.

I'm currently stuck in my mom's house in suburbia, 8k in debt and running my days out as a wagie. I already feel so old. I don't know what to do. I can't hold most conversations. I'm a coward. Everybody's moving ahead in life, except for me.

Thanks for reading, if you have any advice, please say whatever's on your mind."
1596,Anxiety,Hi please make me feel better!!!,"Please tell me positive stories or experiences with buspirone. I’ve had anxiety since I was 12 (along with depression, ptsd, and bpd) I’ve gone thru many trials and tribulations with medications and for the last three years I’ve been off of everything and while that was great for a little while my anxiety is absolutely crippling. So after months of extreme panic attacks, irritability, and physical illness from my anxiety I decided to talk with my doctor. She suggested buspirone so now the only hurdle is taking it but I’m now anxious about side effects and it not working. Please give me some encouragement!!!!"
1597,Anxiety,Asking my friends if I can be included in their activities,"I’m not sure how related this is to my anxiety, but I experience the same feelings that I do when I’m in situations that trigger my anxiety. If this isn’t related please let me know of a subreddit where this would be more relevant.

My group of friends likes to do real life activities such as dinners or general hangouts together, but I’ve noticed that I’m never invited to them or asked if I would be interested in them. Normally I’m terrible in social settings, but I feel like I would actually enjoy and be better in this setting with my friends. I want to ask them about being included in these activities, but I don’t know how to go about it and I have some worries. One thing that I’m worried about is sounding selfish by asking to be included, or sounding demanding. Another thing that is really worrying me is the possibility of me being excluded being an intentional thing, and having to hear them tell me that they don’t want to spend time with me and that I wouldn’t be allowed to spend time with them in this way. Also the fact that I was excluded in the first place just makes me think that they see me as less important or less liked than others in the friend group.

I’m probably overthinking a lot of this but any advice is appreciated nonetheless :)"

Breathe down, expanding your lower abdomen as you inhale

Move them against each other, feeling the gentle friction

Close your eyes

Take five more slow, deep breaths

Stay as long as you'd like, tensing your legs, wiggle your toes.

Take a break from your thoughts

Spend a few moments with your body.

This is kinda silly but something that's been bothering me for a while now. I live with my partner and dogs. I put effort in keeping my house in order. I have decorated it to the best of my abilities. And I have my limitations sometimes when it comes to organization due to my mental health.

But whenever I see someone else's house, either through pics or if I visit them, I feel very unhappy about what I have done. It shoots up my anxiety and makes me feel absolutely bottom tier. I know I should be grateful for what I have and I am but I still can't get a grip over these feelings. I feel like everything about my house is wrong and everyone does it so much better (even writing these thoughts out loud makes me so sick).

Apart from reddit, I don't use any social media. I even stopped buying lifestyle magazines because I couldn't deal with the lifestyle po*n and feel even more anxious.

 If any of you are in the same boat and have some advice for me, I would be grateful."
1606,Anxiety,i need some reassurance — spontaneous anxiety and starting prozac,"hello :) im having trouble with identifying what is wrong with me. just for background, since 2019 ive been having spontaneous on and off anxiety or panic attacks that persist for a week straight. i couldnt sleep well at all. ive had about 3 of these in 2019, but barely any in 2020 and part of 2021. in late May of this year it happened again. I recovered in a week but it came back 3 weeks later and its been lasting for almost 2 weeks which is very odd and trying to sleep has been hell.

I am now taking 10mg prozac for the first time (its my 4th dose today) but i’m still afraid of starting them as ive heard it could make it worse + therapy in 2 weeks. the first 2 days were fine but on the third day i felt worse and i panicked and skipped the next dose with my doctors consultation first of course and i felt fine. but the next morning (today) i woke up full of fear so i emailed my doctor and took my pill. im scared the side effects will impact me negatively as i start uni next month. 

i dont know what causes these anxiety attacks at all as my life is full of genuine love and happiness for everything and everyone around me. my only worry in life is this sudden anxious feeling taking over me. i really dont know what is happening but i hope this treatment works well. please let me know how prozac helped you if it did. thanks guys"

1608,Anxiety,How to survive a panic attack on a plane,"Hi guys, 22M here. I’ve been in the best shape of my life with a great future ahead for me, which is why I hate the fact that my anxiety disorder and panic attacks have never been worse.

I’m currently on a flight from Seattle to New York coming down from the worst panic attack I’ve ever had. I fully dissociated becoming totally numb to myself, couldn’t breathe, had chest pain that made me feel like I was about to die, and couldn’t stop freaking out. This was all happening just as the plane began to take off. For me this was the perfect storm and a nightmare scenario — I dread flying generally speaking and the thought of fainting or screaming on a plane due to panic made me even more nervous. 

Thankfully, panic attacks don’t last longer than an hour for me. With no medication on hand, no water, and really nothing to help, I could only rely on myself. I’m writing this for other people who might be in the same shoes as me one day — know that you’re not alone and things will be ok.

Anyway, these were the things that helped me the most.

1) DEEP, DEEP BREATHS and I cannot stress this enough. Genuine lifesaver. You force yourself to stay at a steady tempo and think about something aside from impending doom. Also keeps your heart rate down. The downside of this for me is that it tends to make me more numb and dizzy, but for about an hour I was just blowing loudly out of my mouth as much air as I could get into my nose at a pace of 5 seconds or so. 

2) tell the people next to you on your plane. They can comfort you or at the very least understand what’s going on in case you’re squirming in your chair or suddenly hysterical as I was. The people in my row were super understanding and asked me questions to keep my mind off of things 

3) think about what you’re excited for when you land. I miss my cat and am excited to play my guitar so that’s what I started thinking about

4) Water!!!!! (When you can) will keep you hydrated and refreshed

5) most important thing I did along with my breathing was tell myself “you will be okay” again and again and again. Believing that is another thing. But I found the strength to reinforce myself positively. I think if you are able to do that you will calm down slowly

I have two more flights in the next seven weeks and would appreciate all helpful suggestions. Panic attacks fucking suck. I’m really grateful for the support on this subreddit and I hope we all have an easier time living life tomorrow &lt;3"
1609,Anxiety,Is there something wrong with me?,"I’m a 21 F and I feel like there is something seriously wrong with me.

It’s to the point that I can never even picture myself with someone because I kinda think like why would they choose me. I’ve never been in a relationship however have slept with some, but this has mostly come from being intoxicated before hand. 
My friends find that weird. I can’t just understand how they can just talk to them and go over and see randoms and sleep with them. I don’t know if this even makes sense I just really need to fix this problem because it’s starting to really affect my mental health. Is there something wrong with me please help."
1610,Anxiety,Too anxious to go to therapy,"Hello, I think this is must first official post on here. 

Any way, I have dealt with anxiety and social anxiety my whole life. I’ve never been diagnosed, but it’s sort of obvious after a while. I been thinking recently that I should go to a therapist, but I’m too anxious to even ask some one for help setting it up and my mom would have to pay for it through insurance, which the cost isn’t the problem I just feel weird asking for therapy because it might seem like out of nowhere. But I know I need it because my anxiety prevents me from doing simple things like driving a car or even talking to strangers in general terrifies me. So how do I get the courage to even make an appointment and then share my deepest personal feelings with a complete stranger? I just don’t know if I’ll benefit and I don’t know if I need a therapist or just a psychiatrist to get some prescriptions for the anxiety. I don’t really know. This is more of just a rant than asking for advice, but I welcome any if anyone has some."
1611,Anxiety,Keep worrying about heart going “slow”. Can’t sleep :/,"My anxiety stems mostly around health anxiety. So I had a 2 week holter monitor in March, all normal. Had a stress test &amp; echocardiogram 2 &amp; half weeks ago, all normal. Have had multiple ekg’s the past year just over anxiety basically, all normal. The dumb thing is I was worrying over my heart feeling like it was racing, now I’ve been worrying that it’s going “too slow”. 

I get mostly anxious as I’m falling asleep cause that’s when you’re most relaxed &amp; I worry it’s going “too slow” before bed. I’ve fallen asleep 3 times now but the second I start falling asleep my mind jolts me awake in a state of anxiety.

1617,Anxiety,I have been having a continuous panic attack for the last four days and I don't know what to do.,"I made my account just to write this in hopes anyone here who's been through the same thing can help me and tell me if this will end and if so will it happen again? Sorry if this is too long or messy, please be considerate of my state right now.

Four days ago, I started to experience the worst panic attack i've had in my life, and it has not gone away since.

Basically, I was on a bus to meet my friend for breakfast, when all of a sudden I noticed the telltale sensations before an anxiety attack, such as I was feeling distant from all the other passengers on the bus, everything felt sort of hazy or blurry, and I started to tense up and sweat. But I've never felt it this intense before. My stomach became instantly upset, everything felt blindingly hot, I couldn't breathe. I tried to calm myself with relaxing music and breathing exercises, which helped only a little, while the panic attack carried on. Meeting my friend and telling them how I felt I returned home, now a little calmer, but still very tense. I thought it was just a nasty panic attack, I've had many anxiety attacks with varying intensities over the years, but never this bad, and to my dismay, it did not pass even after coming home.

I've spoken to my therapist about this, she suggested exercises and to go to the mental health hospital's ER if I feel it getting worse. it did not get worse but did not get better either - I couldn't eat more than two bites of something before feeling sick, whatever I did manage to eat would come out in frequent and mostly fluid bowel movements - so to the mental health hospital I went.

They (as well as my therapist) said it will not last forever, and that it's a string of panic attacks one after the other rather than one big panic attack. The psychiatrist I saw prescribed me Clonex (Clonazepam) 0.5 and I returned home in the evening, feeling somewhat better and very tired. I even managed to eat something before I went to sleep.

The following morning the anxiety was back, and I had to take the Clonex. It made me sleepy and I slept for about an hour and a half before waking up, a little less anxious, and spoke with my therapist again. She again reassured me this will not last forever, but these four days have been frightening and the more time passes the harder this is to believe. And she suggested there was an emotional trigger to all of this, which I have some ideas to what that might have been, but I have barely thought about that after the attack started and it's still going on.

What is wrong with me? How do I make it stop? Will it ever stop? Is this not a panic attack but another medical condition? Please, I don't know what to do with myself. I've been bedridden and my only times of relief are when I'm asleep. Everything adds to my anxiety - others' problems, loud sounds, people talking loudly, even videos I've been watching to distract myself.

Please, anyone who's been through this, tell me it stops, and tell me it never happens again. Just imagining living the rest of my life like this adds to my anxiety tenfold. Thank you.



My medical history for context:

I have been on Sertraline/Zoloft 50mg for a few months now (after a change in medicine that caused an array of symptoms that lasted weeks, and before that I've been on Sertraline 200mg) so my body is accustomed to Sertraline. The staff at the mental health hospital recommended to go back up to 75mg of Sertraline, then back to 100mg.

I have not ingested anything unusual or taken any other medicine, except cold medicine which I've taken for two days prior to the attack (the cold is not coronavirus, I'm vaccinated and my other vaccinated family members have had this same cold), and I've taken this cold medicine before with no side effects. I've stopped taking it the night before this panic attack started."

But I figured I’d follow her for the history facts and the fact that she was an entertaining dancer. Fast forward to today, she turned 18 a while ago. And in the video I saw today she just did this mov where she kinda just juts her hip out and I thought to myself “that was kinda hot” and I realized how weird that sounded considering I followed her before she turned 18 and I’m 22 now. I unfollowed her and I just can’t stop thinking of the possibility of me following her because of some ulterior motive.

My parents are about to be that age and my dad is not in shape and just had a quadruple bypass.

1622,Anxiety,Anxiety is making dating literal terror for me,"Hello,

I would like to know if anyone ever achieved a healthy dating life after being miserable at it so I can have a sliver of hope.

I am a male in my late twenties, and to keep it simple, dating for me equals to constant anxiety attacks, and it just getting worse.

Previously when I dated a girl, I would sometimes loose focus or would be unable to continue a conversation.

Now, it is even worse as I am unable to be human, for example the last time I was dating a girl for a few weeks I:

* was unable to sleep normally
* had constant heart palpitations throughout the day
* had diarrhea all day
* had brain fog
* had small panic attacks (not the ""I am gonna die"", but ""how do I stop existing I hate whatever I am feeling right now, maybe if I watch a youtube video this feeling gonna go away"" type)


Of course I have all the check boxes you could have, I have zero self-confidence, I truly hate myself, and I am feeling absolutely hopeless, even so far that I don't think I am curable. I was somewhat suicidal in the past but I managed to change that with 5 years of therapy. However, this whole dating thing feels immutable. It is even more infuriating, as in normal relationships (friendships for example) are completely normal for me.

The worst thing is the last girl I dated knew about my mental deficiency, and was fully supporting me, but I just couldn't get over it, and we stopped dating. I feel absolutely broken and unfixable.

Let me know if you have some positive stories, suggestions, because I am feeling extremely down nowadays. I am planning to go back to therapy, but of course my anxiety is holding me back on that too.

(side note, this was posted on another subreddit, but for that subreddit the auto mod went hayware, and banned 80% of the comments, except a single persons who called me an asshole lol)

Kind regards,

1623,Anxiety,Withdrawal from beta blockers (Bisopronol) help?,"Hello, I began taking 7.5mg of beta blockers in Jan this year due do sinus tachycardia. Before the medication my resting heart was 101 and 130 whilst doing stuff in the house. 

Since taking the beta blockers my heart rate has reduced but at the age of 26 I do not want to rely on this medication or be on it for the rest of my life. 

I started working out in February and I've been doing loads of cardio. 

Today is my first day without the beta blocker and my heart is going absolutely mental... I have been weaning off over a few weeks.

college, and i wasnt planning on it being so sudden until i realized that there was really no time to apply so now i feel very rushed about it. that and balancing those two out. i need to get a job and i have to go to school now and im stressed about balancing both of those. the other thing stressing me out is that its about to be a whole year since a traumatic even happened, and i just keep putting a bunch of importance over it. my sleep schedule was also really bad the other week. it got to the point where i was up for 24 hours trying to fix it. because of that, i ended up feeling really nauseous, tired and anxious. the past few days ive fixed it though. right now though, i just feel weird and anxious. i dont feel like myself, and i feel like i cant think very clearly. i feel a little frustrated and sad but its hard to let the emotions out. i had a bad dream last night and it kinda scared me. i just dont want to experience this anymore. i was doing amazing the other week and now i feel the opposite. i think maybe my lack of sleep last week just threw me off completely. i was working out and eating consistently and now i lost motivation :/"

1629,Anxiety,Anxious out of nowhere,"Hello Everyone.

So, in February of this year I relapsed into my anxiety (some anxiety ""spikes"", panic attacks, nausea, no appetite etc). This was probably due to COVID lockdown, some insatisfaction with my work and some general feeling of insatisfaction with my life.

After a few rough months I started medication on May, had two weeks of even worst anxiety due to the medication (escitalopram). After that I had a very good 3 weeks, with some anxiety but very manageable or no anxiety at all to the point that I remember thinking ""I almost forgot what its like to be in a panic"".

Until yesterday, for some reason and out of nowhere I had a bad anxiety episode, where I almost freaked out, that lasted a few hours. 

Today, I wake up fine but after a couple of hours I started to feel anxious again...

Does this happens to you guys? I still have stuf that I have to fix in my life, I am aware of that. I already made some changes ( swiming classes, and I started to drive at the age of 36!!) and If I'm being honest I fell in to some old bad habits too (ie too much time on distractions: youtube, games, movies), but I am allowed to do that right?

Overall I'm good, just venting because this situation is a bit frustating... 

We are in this together, let's keep doing our best!"

Is this just classic overthinking on my part?"
1631,Anxiety,Hey I wanna ask if this happens to y’all,"I was chilling and randomly got really nauseous with a headache. I texted my friends and one said to drink water and it helped immensely. I’m well hydrated and live off tea that I make so there’s no sodium unless it’s in the leaves but for most I doubt it since even some of the leaves are made by my family so we can brew them. I didn’t actually vomit but I have before. Now I just have a headache and an a tiny bit nauseous but will get some more water. Could this be tied to my anxiety? I have a lot of doctors appointments this month from getting an MRI to getting reevaluated for autism, so I’ve been more stressed than usual but it’s not as bad as it normally is when I get this nauseous though it is the same feeling I get when I have a breakdown. Sorry if that was ramble-y, I was panicked when I started writing and one called down a bit t would still like to hear what y’all have to say (also it’s been about half a year since my anxiety was bad enough to have me wake up and vomit immediately, so it’s been a while.)"

1633,Anxiety,I’m kind of lost and need some insight or advice,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety my whole life and have finally mustered up the mental energy to get help but things had a turn for the worst.
My SO is a person that doesn’t understand mental health and the kind to be dismissive about it even though l I try my best to explain it. 
However recently my SO has fallen into depression because of the passing of their mother and refuses to accept or get any help and it has been weighing on me slowly. The relationship has been slowly falling apart but both of us still refuses to let go. 

I am almost at my wits end so I proposed a two weeks break and my SO has become even more suicidal because of that. 

I still want to care for my SO but I don’t feel like I have the means to do so anymore. My feelings for my SO are also slowly fading because of that and i am really scared propose a break up.

I haven’t been eating well( just one meal a day) or sleeping well for the past week either. 

Can someone tell me what to do?"

I have the absolute fear of death. I’m just always on edge. I’m too scared to medication to put my mind at ease because I’m too concerned with the side effects. I start therapy on Monday after three years of being on waiting lists. 

Has anyone got any hints or tips at all for dealing with these attacks? I feel like I’ve been through every page on google and tried every technique."

1640,Anxiety,How to do my medical check ups when I suffer from health anxiety,"As the title say I suffer from health anxiety and has been a while.
It wasn't 100% diagnosed, or at least my therapist didn't give me a full straight forward diagnose (she just calls it anxiety) but I am 100% sure it's related to personal health only, because my incidents and extreme panic moments happens in relation to this.
So, here is the problem I want advice on.
My body needs extremely care right now, I am 21 and I am behind of general check ups and have some stuff I should definitely check up, like for example my wisdom tooth that for one year has been giving me periodically pain.
I know I have to do the visits to the doctors, that my last blood test was at 12,  that I should visit a specialist for my Raynaud phemonenon (just to ask tips and do an official check up everything is Allright), that I should check my wisdom tooth and I burnt myself with the laptop and that should need some checking too.
My health was very good when my anxiety started but now with me neglecting this stuff I risk of making stuff go where they shouldn't.
Everytime I talk about it or think about it I get extremely anxious and my biggest fear is to go there in front of the doctor, have a panic attack and faint in front of them, like it happened to me indirectly again.
Everytime I feel pain my anxiety makes it bigger and sometimes make me go into a full circle panic  so close to make me faint.
Or sometimes I talk about what could something be with someone and start feeling pain that ""doesn't exist"".
Talked about the burn with a friend and suddenly my whole arm nerves hurted from start to finish, causing moving it really painful, but I knew it was all in my head.
I also want to get a vaccine shot to feel safer cuz everytime I come from outside (and I already go out rarely) I'm super paranoid and have breath and chest pains.
But I fear that after I get the shot I will experience intense anxiety and wouldn't tell what is caused by the vaccine and what is caused by anxiety.

In short, this anxiety right now could potentially ruin my future life, because it's that time in my life where I should do my check ups.
I already go to a therapist but she is using the talk it out way so I'm not under anything.
She told me to be patient because it takes time to go away which I understand but the question is...

How do I do all these stuff without the anxiety obstacling me?
Is it even possible? I will probably end up feeling sick anyway right?
So how can I make it the less possible painful?
What do you do when you're like me and have to do doctor visits.
I must point that even just passively hearing about anything medical related causes me attacks.
Or even just reading news about vaccines and stuff.
Everything medical makes me go into the full loop of ""throat blocked, can't breath""  (yea first covid period was everyday panic attacks for me, till I decided to not follow any news anymore, so I am out of the loop but a bit safer).

Please give me your advices about it, because I seriously need to address these stuff as soon as I can, I wouldn't want to cause permanent damage..

But I also feel not strong enough to undergo medical procedures or like dealing with my wisdom tooth (that pretty much will have to get removed and is still under skin).

I don't know what to do, how to gather strenght.

Now I've been spiraling into madness blaming myself because it was such an avoidable thing. I've been feeling anxious about it and wondering if I'm ever gonna learn to drive because I really fear getting into much serious accidents and hitting an living person. Now every time I think about driving I think about losing control like I did the other day and not being able to respond as quickly as I should have."
1643,Anxiety,Hydroxyzine making me feel high,"Hey all, a little background. I’ve been dealing with horrid anxiety for a while now and finally decided to ask to be medicated with my doctor. I just finished a month of 5mg lexapro and haven’t really felt a difference so I talked to my doctor again and got 10mg lexapro and hydroxyzine to help with panic/ anxiety attacks. Last night I felt really unwell before dinner so during dinner I took 1 pill. I don’t remember the mg but I was instructed to take 1/2 to 3 pills ever 4 hours as needed. I’m small and decided I probably only needed one. 

About 30ish minutes later I took my daily lexapro as well. 

Within an hour I felt crazy weird. I’ve smoked pot before but not recently and I felt like I had just smoked a bowl. I felt good for about an hour or so then started to feel really panicked. Like a high gone bad. I just laid in bed trying to distract myself and eventually was able to fall asleep. 

About 4 hours later now (4 am) I am awake as can be and cannot fall back asleep for the life of me. I woke up feeling very panicked and again was able to use my phone to distract myself and feel a little better. 

Has anyone had this experience on hydroxyzine? I’m going to contact my doctor today to inform her of this of course but I was wondering if I’m alone in this feeling or not. My side effects definitely do not line up with what I’m reading online."

I always anticipate someone calling me or think I hear conversations between my family from my room upstairs then I have to pause to see if someone is. Half the time no one does.

I asked my mom if she saw that and she said she didn't, and I went back and saw the video doesn't skip there... it was just for like a fraction of a second where I think I may have been completely absent. I've tried Google but still don't understand. 

For what it's worth, my mom is a major trigger for me and my family is, in general, toxic and abusive and I dont know why I come here (their place)... I thought getting out the house might help me feel more sane lol. That was a very jarring experience.. i don't know if I'm blowing things up or not.

1657,Anxiety,Here we go. This is my intro/support post. Wish I could do multiple flairs.,"Hello everyone. I'm 41 years old, and feel like I've slipped through the cracks of society/life, someone that the world doesn't care to really help. Anyone else feel like that?

Anyways, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and depression issues. I'm a pretty emotional guy and tend to cry a lot over things. I tend to excessively worry about things, but my brain kind of doesn't handle the worrying aspect correctly. I'll worry about things BEFORE I'm supposed to worry about them, like I'll be scared that something COULD happen, then when it doesn't happen, I'll kick myself for excessively worrying and spending all that energy in worrying over nothing. I always tend to blow things out of proportion and think of the worst possible scenarios.

Because I have GAD and other issues, I'm on SSDI and haven't had any sort of gainful employment in over 10 years. I'd like to get a job, but I feel helpless. As far as my past employment goes, none of the places I've worked at even exist anymore. So it's not like any previous employers could call them for references. I might as well have never worked a day in my life.

Relationships have never been that great for me either. Relationships with me are short and intense. It tends to go like this... stuff is great at first, then inevitably she ""gets busy"", doesn't text me as often, then will just ghost me completely. I'll ask if it was anything I said or did and she'll assure me it wasn't, even though I know it is. I'm usually lucky if I get a couple months out of relationship.

I see a psychiatrist about all this, even though she helps, I feel like she's not REALLY ""helping"", know what I mean?

So it'll always end up with me and my cat alone in my apartment.

Mental health issues are truly awful aren't they?

I need the hug and support flair too, but figured I'd do the introduction first."

For example i play world of Warcraft if anyone has ever heard of it. I am to afraid to play the warlock affliction class because if i play that class I will get a disease in real life like what?!? Also when i say my prayers before bed i hold my breath and if i exhale before i finish i have to start over again. I wont tell my fiancé this because she wont understand. Im assuming to overcome this i would need to do some sort of exposure therapy so play the game and then think nothing will happen and like not hold my breath and see what happens but easier said then done lol.

This whole thing started because 1 night, I saw something on TV about hearts that kinda spooked me and because of the spooking, it made me hyperventilate a little and for some reason it carried on into the following morning.
 Now I’m at this weird point. I know that I’m fine ! I keep telling myself I’m fine, I’m healthy n all, but idk. 

Like… as of recently it seems that when I’m alone, I can’t help but think about my breathing. It’s annoying asf ! HOWEVER when I’m laying down on my phone, scrolling or talking to my friends/ in conversation, most of the time I’m good, I forget it completely ! 
But idk, once I stand up I tell myself “hey it stopped !” But me saying that triggers it again.
I can’t help but spectate myself due to me subconsciously hoping it stops (contradicting Ik..🤦🏾‍♂️) but it always links back to it 😖

I’ve always been a very anxious person. If you’re into astrology, im a Virgo and we tend to overthink EVERYTHING. I used to have a problem that I always noticed my heartbeat whenever it skipped a beat. I would think there was something wrong with me and until I went to a doctor to actually check my heart and say I was fine, my anxiety started coming to an end. I was still kinda anxious for a couple days after but then, through deep breaths and time I guess I just got distracted enough from it to finally ignore/accept it. Even if I can feel my heartbeat now, it can notice it for a couple seconds and forget about it.
But my breath is different :/ idk how to trick my mind into accepting this one. Never dealt with this before.
There’s so many things I’m not thinking about, idk why breathing is there.
I’m always down now and eating feels like I’m for forcing myself to cuz of this weird anxious feeling in my abdomen that always reminds me.. 
plz help 😪🙏🏽"

He told one of our other employees that ‘we’re not stupid’, referring to our company, and ‘that there’s cameras’ and asked if he drinks and when he said yes he told him to just not do it at work.  

we’re not really not getting any complaints except the beer. everything looks pretty good. He even said so himself, there’s some small things to improve on, but they’re easy fixes. 

He brought up the beer at the beginning of shift and said it had happened like three or four times before with previous employees and they just lock that kitchen it’s in and ask for a reimbursement for the missing beer. He didn’t accuse anyone, but has just been poking around today and will be at work the next two or three days.  

Shit just gives me anxiety, I need this job. It’s like am I gonna get written up for this? Get fired? Why does it gotta be all sneaky and why are my brother and I being spied on?

1665,Anxiety,My intrusive thoughts are back,"TW: talking about existence, paranoia, panic attacks, ocd tendancies, thoughts about su1c1d3 

17F here. 

In March I got off of prozac. I took 40mg once a day, every day. I was prescribed it by my family doctor who said I definitely had anxiety. I had 200+ intrusive thoughts a day, and was constantly crying. I couldn't do anything without have a panic attack, and I would wake up in the middle of the night constantly multiple times. I got off of prozac because I didn't need it anymore. I went cold turkey without my doctor knowing, but it was okay because I felt fine without them. 

Now it's July and I'm now starting to fall into constant paranoia. I'm stressed because I'm still feeling the aftermath of my grandmother's (who was like a parent to me) death and am anxious about living with my stepsister who moved into my house a few weeks ago. 

I'm getting intrusive thoughts all the time. Here's some examples:

• if you do _ your soul will be gone
• you didn't sleep last night? Guess your immortal maybe you'll never sleep again
• say _ so that your mom won't die today

I get them around 10-20 times a day. 

I can't deal with these. Paired with my intrusive thoughts and probable depression, my urge to di3 us quite strong. I don't want to, and don't plan to, but if these thoughts keep getting worse and turn to 200+ a day I don't know what I'll do. 

Please help me I'm very scared and I feel alone. I'm scared that my thoughts aren't fake. I'm sleep deprived from not being able to sleep last night (even with melatonin) and am physically shaking because I'm cold and tired and anxious. I'm scared."

I want to have a nice dinner party with friends

I have friends but not true friends 
↓
I should make new friends, find my ‘people’ 
↓
Most people are annoying once I get close to them

It’s probably not the their fault, there must be something terribly wrong with me, oh god I am selfish, critical, reserved, Im probably undeserving of nurturing relationships

Basically I don't like the anxiety reducing videos on YouTube cos it's kinda boring. The background noise can be useful sometimes but I prefer songs with vocals and listening to people talk about things other than anxiety.

Do you guys have any calming music (I'm thinking Paul by Big Thief, Tamino, Eliot Moss, Hozier, etc) or YouTube videos that you use as background noise to sleep?

I used to listen to Mark, Wade and Bob play raft but I can't find anything similar to that.

Any recommendations are appreciated."
1673,Anxiety,Does anyone else get this?,"When you're really anxious do any of you notice your vision change, for some reason when i'm about to have a panic attack, my vision brightens and it hones in on my surrounding."
1674,Anxiety,I feel like everyone around me is judging my every move,"I don't know if anyone else ever feels like this. I'm sure some definitely will.

Sometimes I feel like no matter who I'm around or where I am, even if literally no one is thinking about me, I feel like everyone I know is thinking about me or wondering what I'm doing and what I'm up to at all times of the day.

It feels like this huge weight that everyone is judging my every action. Maybe some are; and maybe it's as a result of past trauma of some treating me as such.

I just want to live outside of my head and feel fulfilled and happy with what I am doing instead of constantly feeling compromised and victimised by society and the people around me feeling as if they are sabotaging it or about to.

Some people have called this imposter syndrome; after some reflection I do believe I suffer from it. But I don't necessarily ever feel like I don't earn where I am. I guess to an extent; I do experience this.

It's fucking awful and I just want to feel like I am strong enough to not care of other people's opinions of me and feeling like everyone is thinking about me all the time. I come up with scenarios in my head about what they could be saying or thinking about me. Even if they are and even if it's only for a split second, my brain will imagine like it's happening all the time.

It becomes so extreme the only thing that puts a stop to it is being busy and being surrounded by faily or friends.

It's a difficult one. I hope I can get through this."
1675,Anxiety,feeling better,its a bit pathetic though. i only feel better when i don’t see them together.
1676,Anxiety,Trying to stay calm and thinking the worst,"Generalized Anxiety Disorder right here and PTSD. So last year my mom died last year(July 1st), I witnessed everything and had to be the one to call my Dad. It’s been a rough year and he’s had a rough go. It’s been a stressful week, but I’ve been keeping myself preoccupied so I don’t fly off the edge. I’ve been trying to call my Dad last night and he hasn’t answered. Left two messages. He can be oblivious and forget to check the caller ID and I know he’s upset still about my mom and maybe he just doesn’t want to talk. But my head is going to a very dark place. My grandfather lasted just a year and a half after my grandmother died - so I’m kinda freaking out. I’m going to head over later if I don’t hear anything. 

I’m shaking on my couch, trying not to overeat and thinking of every worst case scenario and how I’m going to handle it all and this fool probably just doesn’t want to talk and not thinking about his actions affects everyone else. 

I’m just acting stupid and it’s probably fine. But the whole what if thing keeps popping in my head and I know I should go clean or do something to take my mind off it, but it’s hard."
1677,Anxiety,I have a question about my question?,Has anyone tried exposure therapy for treating anxiety and or OCD? I asked this question a couple days ago but I have not gotten a response and I really would like to know. Why haven't I gotten a response?
1678,Anxiety,Why am I having such a hard time expressing gratitude towards people?,"I'm 23F an I struggle with expressing gratitude towards people even if they really helped me.

I struggle especially with men, they love gratitude for sure but I treat everything they do for me as obvious thing.

I also fell while expressing gratitude that I'm making myself lower than the other person, humiliate myself and feel like a servant to my master. So I tend to avoid this kind of situation, therefore I don't say gratitude words towards other person and they think I'm mean and ungrateful.

Why is it so hard for me to be grateful for the things people do for me and why do I take is as an obvious think as they should serve me to gain my affection?"
1679,Anxiety,Can’t get a job or keep a job due to anxiety.,"I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I’m 20 and diagnosed with Social Anxiety Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. It also has completely taken over my life for as long as I can remember. When I was in school, I was bullied because of my social anxiety because I would never ever talk at school. I wanted to, but just couldn’t get the words out. Now, as an adult, the same thing is happening but different situation. I’ve had a couple jobs but they didn’t last very long. At every job I had, I got discriminated against because of my anxiety. Even when I’ve tried to put myself out there and go to job interviews, they could tell that I was shy and had anxiety which doesn’t make me look like a good candidate. I’ve tried looking for a new job now for quite awhile and I’ve had zero luck. I feel so stuck with life. I feel so unmotivated due to this. I’m an adult now and I still live at home because I’m basically dependent still due to my crippling anxiety. I’m also on 20mg of Prozac and I still feel anxious and nothing is helping. I even get jealous of other people my age that are living their best life. Getting jobs, moving out, having kids, not overthinking everything……"
1680,Anxiety,"My anxiety the last month, the physical symptoms, the hospital visits, and how I handled it!","About 1 month ago I start having difficulty swallowing. It almost felt like my tongue was swelling and I was no longer able to eat. I went to the hospital to have lots of tests ran and they were finding nothing. They actually said maybe it's acid reflux and prescribed me some meds for that.

Those mods did not work after 3 weeks of taking it. 2 weeks ago I decided to start counseling and to see a naturopath doctor. I've done 2 counseling sessions and bought lots of supplements from my naturopath doctor. These both combined started to work at relieving the discomfort I had going on in my throat and toungue.

2 days ago I decided to pick up meditation..... This right here was the game changer I believe. After day 1 of meditation I felt slightly better. After day 2 of meditation I felt 10x better. I have no idea why and how but it was 10 minute sessions that did so much relief!! I was skeptical about meditation, but I cannot believe it's working so well.

Anyways, what I wanted to get to here is that I thought I wA absolutely sick. But it looks like the problem is anxiety which is causing unbelievable real symptoms. A mix of counseling, naturopath, and Meditation absolutely helped 1 million percent in such a short time! I hope this message gets to someone experiencing slightly the same as me and can find reassurance that it's not permanent the way you are feeling and there's many ways to help tackle it!

I'm an open ear if you ever need. Dm"
1681,Anxiety,Dealing with fear of your own medicine,"Hey guys, been suffering with anxiety and panic attacks since 2019. Couple months back i had a real big flair up after having a panic attack in my car. Doc told me to go back on lexapro, but I was taking 25mg of Amitryptiline already and all i could do was worry about serotonin toxicity... took it one day and had the worst panic attack at 4am. After that ive been terrified of my own meds. Saw the doc yesterday and he prescribed buspirone instead and gave me a scrip for ativan for emergencies. Still on the ami though, and cant take the buspirone because of the fear... cant take the ativan to calm down for the same reason. Tried hydroxizine a couple weeks ago, same issue. Has anyone dealt with this? How did you break the cycle? I know i need to ""just take my meds"" but the fear is so intense i just know im going to give myself a panic attack. Im starting a new job tuesday (technically returning to a job i was laid off from during covid) and i just want to get the shit levelled off so i can work and not have more panic attacks at work. 

Super long and i apologize. Thanks guys. Anxiety fucking sucks."
1682,Anxiety,Trazadone or actual panic attack?,"I take trazadone for sleep and never exactly had much issues with it. Last night I took them and was watching a show..about 5-10 mins later I felt this wave of nerves through me, felt shortness of breath and it made me jolt up. I felt my heart start pounding/racing and was scared I needed an ER.

Its upsetting worrying if it was the meds or a panic attack happened at thr wrong time. Now I'm scared to take trazadone and scared I won't get sleep for work. 

I think I'm filing for disability...I cant do this."
1683,Anxiety,I have an interview in just under a week - any tips?,"I can't bring myself to prepare for it - partly because I'm not sure how to and partly because of my anxiety. I keep focusing on what I am lacking instead of being confident in my skills and experiences- they must've seen something in my written application to have offered me the interview!

Would really appreciate it if anyone could provide any useful advice! TIA!"
1684,Anxiety,Should I beat myself up about being awkward in public?,Someone told me everyone is awkward so I shouldn't worry about it. It's just difficult not to.
1685,Anxiety,Do I Need Medication?,"I can't do confrontation. If someone is mad at me, regardless if I'm in the right or wrong, I shut down for a couple of hours. 

It's werid. When it comes to some things, I can handle it well. Job interviews for example (I just graduated), I've done plenty of them and while I'm not perfect, I tend to conduct myself well regardless. It's only when someone is upset with me."
1686,Anxiety,Leaving for vacation..,"On Monday I’ll be hopping into the car to drive 16 hours to maryland , and about 2 weeks ago I started Zoloft, it has worked pretty well as I’ve had zero panic attacks in that time frame or 2 weeks, but as the day inches closer I can feel the butterflies in my chest and panic starting to set in, even while medicated, is that normal? And will it subside with the medicine during its peak time (4.5-8 hours after taking it) . My trigger has always been leaving the house and every long car ride I’ve ever been on I deal with excruciating stomach pain, vomiting and nausea as soon as I get in the car. It’s safe to say I’m scared, I haven’t had to do anything THIS big in terms of my anxiety for a while. Just looking for any advice or anyone who has also taken Zoloft on how it works and will effect the situation"
1687,Anxiety,Im 18yrs/o (M) i recently graduated from highschool and my anxiety got worse,"For a long time i knew that something was wrong but i didn't think it worth addressing. It was so bad that it affected my grades until grade 11. It got worse after a almost lost a friend and that made the anxiety get worse. After building up enough confidence to go on a stage for academic events it all just left when the panic atracks kept coming. I couldn't stop feeling like people i cared about were going to kill themseleves and even if i tried my best to convince them not to i wasn't a good enough reason. Due to covid schools closed and we were all waiting for what next to do. That gave me time to get most of myself together and eventually I got into a relationship with a really close friend of mine. I was afraid to care about someone even more afraid but i just took it as a chance for me to get over the trauma i experienced. Because of that relationship i was even able to pass my finals last year. It was an online relationship and we hoped to meet in person and we did. With time i noticed that this person was different from being online and i loved her even more because i got to see the real her. She wasn't that big on physical intimacy but i didnt mind and i respected the boundaries. We broke up after 1 year and almost 2 months. It didn't end on bad terms and we never argued on serious topics. We both gave our best into the relationship but at some point she doubted her own feelings. I didn't get why she felt that way even though she couldnt help but say she loved me. The day we broke up i found out that she had a mixed bipolar disorder and she was having a manic episode when we first started dating. She said she still loved me but not in a romantic way and she said that things wont change(except the lovey dovey parts). I honestly dont want to let her go and she feels the same. We've both helped each other in getting better and she's the one who encouraged me to tell my parents about my panic attacks.
I told them about my anxiety and it made me feel worse because i finally admitted that it is a problem and i needed help. I started twitching and i felt so heavy.
My mom's very religous and told me to pray on it and read the bible which btw didnt make the situation better for me.
Its been a month now and I'm getting better. My parents are hesitating to take me to a therapist because they are worried that I'll starting taking meds which will only make me worse so i do therapy over the phone with proffessionals that will notify them on whether meds would be appropriate or not.
Im supposed to start university next year and I'm honestly worried about how I'll perform then. On top of that i realised that i might have social anxiety and would explain why i constantly feel like people are looking at me and judging what i wear( which i managed to train my mind to not care about) but constantly feeling that way each time i go out makes me feel a little uneasy. 


I know this was quite a lot and i hope you got my perspecrive on the explanation. But I'm just wondering if it's possible to go without meds and if they're bad for anxiety."
1688,Anxiety,My brain feels so fragile..,"After I got my second concussion in January, my head felt a lot l more fragile then before. I can’t even shake my head without feeling a moving sensation in my head"

1690,Anxiety,Extreme interview anxiety,"I have extreme interview anxiety to the point that I can’t formulate proper sentences, I have huge gaps of time where I am frozen and don’t know what to say, and I’m noticeably shaking/trembling. I have a one hour 5-person panel interview today for a paralegal position and I have no prior paralegal experience. I am incredibly nervous to the point that I feel like I’m going to throw up. I completely ruined every interview or job opportunity I’ve had thus far because of my nerves. Does anyone else have experience in this and overcoming it?"
1691,Anxiety,Feel trapped by my medication,"31M, healthy heart, all checked out. Been suffering crippling pain (due to anxiety, especially cardiophobia) past two months. Psychiatrist prescribed propranolol 20mg twice a day.  


I feel absolutely trapped by this drug. The drug itself is fine and has probably helped me start walking around, but I know that sudden withdrawal can damage my heart. If I lose the pills, I damage my heart. If I run out of pills and forget to refill, I damage my heart.  


And I have to check my blood pressure before taking them (to make sure it's not too low). My blood pressure machine scares the hell out of me. When it squeezes my arm I can feel heartbeats. Is it gonna interfere with the beating of my heart? Is it gonna burst an artery in my arm? My arm is in pain, I don't think that's normal, I've only been measuring blood pressure twice a day. And if I don't measure it before taking the drug, I could die.

There's a million ways to die with this poisonous medication. I should have never started this drug."
1692,Anxiety,Fear of a financial crisis,"I’m 23 years old, and I recently accepted a full time job. I just graduated college, and I’m ready to start living in the real world. 

With all the market/inflation/economy/stock shit going on, I’ve seen a lot of things saying there is an inevitable crash coming, leading to a big financial crisis. This kind of stuff scares me, cause I saw how it affected my family in 2008. Now I’ll be experiencing it directly, and it will have an impact on my own finances. I’m scared of what’s to come."
1693,Anxiety,"Dont know what to do, this is so confusing..",Im terrified that im just going to completely become a loser that leeches off my parents to get by yet I dont want to take the steps of going to university because I feel as If I will drop out anyways.

I just dont know what to do.
1694,Anxiety,I’m getting really anxious about my trip tomorrow.,"I’m flying tomorrow to visit a friend for her birthday. I’m 26F for reference.

I’m only going to know her. She’s renting an Airbnb on the beach but it’s with a bunch of girls she’s friends with that I don’t know.

For some reason, I’m getting a lot of anxiety about going. I feel like I’m going to feel really out of place and going to just wish I was back home with my dog and my boyfriend. I wish I didn’t think this way, but I’m already preparing to feel this way.

Also, she’s the type of friend that doesn’t like to drink too much or go out and do fun things like that. She’s great and I do appreciate her as a friend, but I know it’s going to just be a really “chill” type of beach day and for some reason that gives me more anxiety because it’ll just be really low key and I’ll have more time to think and be anxious.

It’s also just hard in general for me to leave my boyfriend. I’m going to be gone for 5 days and it seems like a really long time 😕"
1695,Anxiety,Anxiety/OCD/PTSD,"I’m in tears writing this. I’m the proud father of two boys, my newest being born on the 26th! As happy as I am I have spiraled down an impossible rollercoaster of scenarios that lead to my children being seriously negatively impacted.

My newest son was born with jaundice (extremely common and treatable) I didn’t eat for 2 days and obsessed over him developing brain damage from the treatment not working (it did)

My other son is less than 2 and I’ve obsessed over milestones to the point where if anything is off I assume he has developmental delays that can’t be treated with therapy. (I.e he jumps during playtime is because he has autism) 

My brain will not let me enjoy the most beautiful things in my life. My wife is very helpful and patient but I fear she can only hold on for so long. 

My obsessing and negative thinking has to have a serious impact on my family.

I'm also overly emotional and cry easily and all that shit. So the idea of working scares the shit out of me. I'm going to be looking for my first job soon, and I gave myself a migraine just thinking about it. I know that's pathetic. Can you humor me tho. Is there any advice you could give to a kid with the problems that I have that relate to work? Like ideas of where someone like me could apply? Or how to deal with being scared about work or just general emotions that come with having a job? 

I don't really have anyone to go to about this stuff so I came to Reddit. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

I’m supposed to get my second shot tomorrow, but I am staying with my anti-vaxx-covid-is-a-lie-and-vaccines-are-to-control-the-population family and the horror stories and misinformation is relentless. The stream of terror is CONSTANT. I already have palpitations and panic disorder. I was already a little under the weather before my first shot, and afterwards I had a sore throat and a swollen lymph node in my armpit for about two weeks. I just flew back home to high altitude for a funeral after living at low altitude. I had altitude sickness for like a day or two, but feel adjusted now. My family is just cruel. They are so paranoid and hateful towards anyone who even wears a mask. It stresses me the hell out. I know they talk about me behind my back, insisting they have the right to know whether or not I get the vaccine. They are convinced it’s going to kill me or something.. it’s not helping me feel good about the 2nd dose. I just want to start shaking all the time. I feel my muscles tensing up and trying to tremble... sorry for my rambling. I’m just terrified. Did anyone get the second moderna shot? How did you feel after? Am I overthinking this? I need reassurance."

1699,Anxiety,"I don't know where to post, I'm desperate for mental help right now please anyone","I'm in complete agony. I have cried whatever tears I can cry. I feel so numb and suicidal right now.

I just drove home by myself from the ER after admitting my husband. He has appendicitis and a bowel obstruction. He has to be monitored overnight. Tomorrow morning, he will get another CT scan with contrast dye and see whether he needs laparoscopic surgery or not. I know appendectomies are extremely common, as are bowel obstructions, but we have never experienced being a part like this. He has always been healthy, and this is a shock to both our systems.

I am absolutely devastated and so paranoid that he's going to die. I cannot function, eat, sleep, think, or breathe. I don't know how to calm myself down. I feel so numb and scared for my husband. My heart is broken and I feel sick I had to leave him due to ending visit hours. I can't sleep I can't think.

Please tell me someone that he will be okay. I keep praying to a God I don't even know. I'm just so desperate because I know if he leaves, I can't carry on. I have a death plan. I can't function without my other half. I'm so scared about tomorrow. I feel so scared and empty."
1700,Anxiety,it gets worse everyday.,"i always have had anxiety. ever since i was little. of course, back then i had no idea what anxiety was. i had no idea what was causing the panic attacks where i cojldn’t breathe, or when i’d feel sick but i couldn’t throw up. but it’s not like i worried about every little thing. around a year ago, march 2020, i noticed my anxiety was getting noticeably worse. around september, i found myself starting to get worried about things i’ve never worried about before. i wasn’t getting worried about most things, but i was getting really worried about most litte things. now, it’s june. i worry about literally everything. i can barely go 5 minutes through the day without worrying about some stupid thing. i hate it so much. it’s limited the things i can do. i can’t hang out with friends, i can’t watch certain things, fuck, i barely trust myself to hold a water glass without being scared to death over the fact that i could spill the tiniest fucking drop. i hate it."

And there’s no one I can tell, so I’m just leaving this here. I hate being crazy so, so much. And yes, I’m medicated. But still. Still."
1702,Anxiety,Worrying about partner’s job,My husband and I have been living together for a little over a year and our relationship is perfect. My only problem is that I am naturally a very anxious person and he has a relatively dangerous job. I have mostly had my anxiety under control with medication and therapy but I’ve had to switch medicine a few times and I’m now back to having regular panic attacks because I’m worried about him while he’s at work. Recently his coworker had a pretty close call and almost had a tree fall on him and ever since hearing about it I haven’t been able to sleep well and I’ve been having panic attacks and constantly worrying about him at work. I’ve talked to him and my therapist about it but nothing has helped. I just constantly imagine the worst case scenario. I have PTSD and other mental health issues and I’ve already been through so many bad things that I can’t help but expect the worst. I hate feeling like I’m just continuously waiting for something bad to eventually happen. If anyone has any advice or experience with a similar situation I would appreciate it.
1703,Anxiety,Is my anxiety just lying to me?,"I made this new group of friends online over the past couple of months and I really like them but I'm constantly having doubtful thoughts about them, I feel like they're too nice to me and it's all just a joke to them because they're not actually interested in me at all, they just want to mislead me so they can stab me in the back. They seem really interested in me and I don't know if I feel this way because I've never had a friend group care about me much or it's because they truly are just misleading me to make a joke out of me.

I often feel like cutting all ties with them so they can't effect me but there's this small part of me that worries they do actually want to be friends with me and they'll be hurt if I just completely cut off all contact but I'm seriously doubting they actually care at all.

I've been seriously considering cutting them off but with this amount of information you have, do you think these people like me as much as I like them or do you think my suspicions are most likely true?"

1705,Anxiety,Has your anxiety ever cost you professional opportunities or had financial implications?,"I've been doing some thinking tonight about times my anxiety has really hurt my ""work life"".  Most of the jobs I can get require interaction with customers, the general public or talking on the phone.  I just can't deal with that.  It sends my anxiety through the roof.

All of the mental illness stuff I deal with sort of forced me into entrepreneurship at one point.  That wasn't a bad thing and it was great for my confidence.  I kind of fell into depression and let the business slip.  Was definitely getting bored with it toward the end.

I've tried to hold down a slew of jobs but the only one I've ever been able to hold down involves caring for dogs full time.  I only have to talk to my co-workers and spend some of my day just hanging out with dogs.  There's a certain comfort in spending so much time with animals.  The job allows me to show my gentler side, I think.

I'm 28, I have some pretty in demand skills and a degree.  My anxiety has definitely steered me away from any sort of tradition career.  I was on track to land a 50k+ job with a pension but couldn't deal with how the position totally ruined my mental health.  Not being able to hack it definitely can make you feel like a behavior.

I've just grown to accept that I will almost always be in some degree of poverty.  A mentally ill dude (very possibly on the autistic spectrum) kind of just living on the fringe.  There's just such a feeling of being on the outside looking in.  Had I not had to deal with such fragile mental health, I believe my life would have turned out very differently."

My brother is going to X university, and in captains practices before the season my brothers friend had been wearing a X university pinnie. Today, after our last practice, I asked Bob if i could have that X university pinnie if he wasn’t gonna play the sport anymore. He said that he was sad to see it go and told me to wear it proud, then gave it to me. I don’t know if he bought the penny a while ago or just this year. I feel like he was reluctant to give me the pinnie. Should i try to give it back to him? How would i go about doing that?

I always worry about health stuff no matter how many doc visits and different tests I’ve had for so many different things, all normal. I won’t take daily meds cause I just have a fear of them.

1709,Anxiety,"Can't sleep at night, can't sleep during the day😫!!!","It took me quite a long time (around 3 years ) to fix my sleep schedule due to anxiety attacks and depression. But lockdown began in late 2019 and my sleep schedule got messed up. 3months ago I finally fixed it. Last month I recovered from covid and ever since then I can't sleep at night, at least not peacefully. I'm waking up after every 30-40 mins.   
as a result, every morning I'm waking up feeling hungover and I'm tired throughout the day. I can't sleep during the day either (work and studies😞😞).   
I tried a few supplements but it just made my headache worse.

I can't see my partner for 2 weeks and he's asleep so I'm just alone in my room, stressed and paranoid and I want to sleep but I'm too scared to.

I get insane stomach aches and it makes me feel like I'm going to throw up which makes me grind my teeth, and I guess my question is just do the physical symptoms ever go away once you get some kind of treatment or therapy for it? or do you just get better at managing them? because I can't imagine going through my whole life cowering in my bed or on the couch moments before i have to go out and not being able to eat for a whole day before because my stomach hurts so bad and my heart races."
1715,Anxiety,Separation Anxiety,"i’ve been in my first serious relationship for almost a year now. i’ve always been an anxious person, but my anxiety hasn’t been as extreme as it has been recently. i’ve gotten better about being in a constant state of anxiety, but i still cry every time i have to leave their house. i stay up late worrying if they’re ok. i shut down if i even get the slightest hint they’re upset. 

it isn’t fair to them for me to make them feel like they’re the problem, because they aren’t. it’s simply an issue with my brain. i had a major episode in december when they were in an accident and i couldn’t do anything. it broke me and i couldn’t leave my bed for two weeks. it killed me. 

i see a therapist every week and take a daily medication, but i don’t feel as though the problem has been addressed. i’m not exactly sure what i’m seeking by posting here. does anyone else feel this way? has anyone gotten past this? will there be a day where i can be away from them without feeling this way? any insight is appreciated"

Recently I've been obsessing over this one thing that happened to me 1 year ago. So I have an 18yo sister. We hug each other while sleeping. (Not in a sexual way at all) She was asleep and I went to hug her and then I got thoughts where I imagined she was my crush instead of my sister. I then started thinking about him. (All this for a split second). I remember thinking that's weird and removed my hand off her. But now I'm not sure. Idk if I removed my hand off her or not. What if I didnt remove my hand?

I can’t stand my anxiety anymore, I can’t walk into work without my heart beating quick and this immense feeling of being judged and me awkwardly not knowing where to look and it all adds up to the point I can’t remember my passcode to clock into work, the passcode is my birthday. I’ve tried meditation, exercise, eating right, etc, but nothing helps working around a bunch of Narcissists, some days I think it will be better just ending things but I don’t want to hurt my family and I think I just say that to myself to scare me or something. I don’t want to go on meds but if a pill can help me, well that’s just unreal."

1729,Anxiety,I experienced my first panic attack,"TRIGGER WARNING

Please don’t continue to read if you are sensitive to the topic of panic attacks and or cancer.

Hello everyone I’m a 23 M, Saturday night I experienced my first panic attack. I took a THC edible and masturbated a couple minutes right after the gummy. After masturbating I had this weird sensation like I blacked out and came back in suddenly, I panicked I ran to my parents room and cried and told them something is wrong with me. I can’t feel anything, my vision is going in and out, I can’t taste anything, nothing seems like it’s making sense. They took me to the ER and I was there for hours. They didn’t ran any test on me at all. They really thought I had my first episode of a panic attack. I thought to myself “Well they never tested me for a brain tumor.” That thought stuck with me, for the next couple days I had a strong sense of derealization and deprersonalization it made me so uncomfortable I went to my primary care today. He also said it was probably due to the bad reaction of the gummy and the anxiety shot up and has now brought anxiety down on me. He didn’t do an x-ray or a CAT scan or any other thing because he confidently said he doesn’t think it’s a brain tumor. How can you be sure? Right now I just randomly woke up from my sleep, scared. I immediately called my spouse, told her I don’t know what happened I woke up scared. I’m so obsessed with a brain tumor that I remember her saying “You don’t wake up suddenly from your sleep” that’s apparently a symptom of a brain tumor. Well I just did… so does that mean I have one? I mean I did have a full bladder I will admit. I also haven’t had any symptoms of derealization or depersonalization unless my anxiety begins to rise up drastically again. My vision is fine, my speech is fine, my movement is fine, my taste is fine, my senses are perfectly normal.

So why Am I so obsessed with a brain tumor? Why can’t I focus on anything else? I don’t have any type of family history with cancer so thank God. But I’m so dang scared of it. Im sorry if this post was all over the place I just needed to type everything that was out on my mind and hopefully someone here can relate to me and help me out thank you."

1731,Anxiety,Work Anxiety ruining my life,"Hi guys, I hope this is allowed as I really need some advice. Please delete if not by the rules. 

I (24f) graduated last year and have been in a professional, (remote) customer service role since January. 

I was bullied every day by customers, being shouted at, sworn at and even complained about to my manager when asking customers to stop. 

In the end it all got too much and on Monday last week I worked my last shift at the company. 

Thankfully, I was able to secure myself a new office based role through a referral from one of my long time friends, as he raved about how happy I would be there, and having smashed the interview I also felt confident regarding this new venture. 

Yesterday was my first day of my new role and I had to go into the office to set up. After a pretty rough first day and an evening full of tears, hyperventilating and panic attacks, I have now woken up to some awful family news. 

I have been awake since 5am crying, worrying about everything, feeling like I’m going to die or someone in my family just has and I have no idea what to do. 

My team leader isn’t going to be at work today because she is taking annual leave to get her hair done so I’ve been given someone in the offices number to contact in case of sickness. 

I am absolutely going to call the number given and let someone in office know I won’t be in today, I’m just stressed about what to do next. 

I feel like I need some time off to recoup and put things in order but have just started a new role. Do I just quit and find a new one when I’m better or do I try and discuss with my team leader when she’s back tomorrow? Baring in mind going into the office right now makes me feel like I’m not good enough and never will be. 

Please be kind, any advice is more than appreciated. I am really really struggling to find the meaning for me being here right now. 

TLDR: started new job yesterday struggling really really bad, do I quit and take time off or do I try and negotiate this with them"

1734,Anxiety,Don't you fucking dare give me that philosophical shit in the comments.,"I see a lot of people here asking one common question which is - WHY ME. Why do I have to face all the bad luck while others lead a happy life. 

The answer is very simple if you're willing to understand - FUCK PEOPLE. IT HAS TO BE YOU OVER ANYONE ELSE (INCLUDING YOUR PARENTS). please stop living your life as per societal norms and some karmic shit. 

If someone does bad to you, reciprocate even harder so that they know who they messed with. 
If someone does good to you, good for you. Don't carry this baggage that you've to be nice to them for the rest of your life. 

Start fucking with emotions, your own and of people around you. The moment you stop giving a fuck about what your heart wants you'll be at peace. TRUST ME. 

Be practical. Let this be a give and take thing. Start seeing people and relationships as one time fixed contracts. When you're done with them, leave. Stop giving fucks about how they would feel and shit like that. Start using people if you want to be happy. You're not here to be a spiritual guide lmao. 

Start living your life and fucking with people's lives."

Dont get me wrong, I would love to move out become independent and enjoy the freedom and make memories and build experience but I have severe attachment issues and my family is everything to me.

I was just wanting to know if these symptoms were just from anxiety or something else? My calf muscles are also twitching for some reason, I can feel it move by itself and just everything happening to me is so scary. I don’t know how to get through this.

1743,Anxiety,Battling anxiety is exhausting,"First thing first: sorry if some things aren’t well said, english isn’t my first language. 

Sometimes, I feel like giving up. Everything is hard even taking my meds. I am diagnosed with General anxiety disorder, depression and hypochondria.

I constantly fall in vicious circles I can’t seem to be able to get out of. I get depressed and cant find the motivation to do shit; I get anxious because i’m not doing anything and get’s behind on many things, then it becomes over whelming and I get depressed again because I feel like im an useless human being.

I’ve been in therapy for 6 months. Once a week. Im also on Zoloft. Well im supposed to be. Apparently I’m too stupid to take them. I take them for a month, then I stop, etc. 

At this point I know it’s my own fault. But it’s just hard. On top of that I’m always convinced I’m dying of a new disease every week. Its obsessive. I spend hours searching symptoms.

Its keeping me from actually living. Im so tired. I dont know what to do anymore."

For example, whenever I start to convince myself I have cancer or something, for days I’ll just notice an increase in videos about cancer on the internet, or even notice people around me mentioning it. It only increases my anxiety because my irrational brain takes it as conformation, or like a sort of “sign” of my impending death. Is this a common thing to experience? I know the brain tends to see whatever it’s looking for, but sometimes it’s a little scary. I’m not superstitious or anything, just seems really ominous."

1746,Anxiety,I don’t feel normal anymore. Nothing is the same like it used to be. Can’t tell if this is due to anxiety or depression,"Crosspost from r/depression

Hi guys, 19 year old hypochondriac here. I feel like I’m slowly losing myself honestly. I’ll start off on a whim saying that nothing feels normal, everything has changed. I think this is due to the combination of changes in my life, health anxiety, smoking weed, and looking at everything in a new perspective. This “new perspective” is absolutely destroying me. I’m constantly thinking about death and not existing (not like suicidal thoughts AT ALL. Just like a fear of death per se). I’m really worried that I’m on the brink of losing my mind. My first plan of action is to lay off on the weed, then find a therapist for this shit. I feel like this is a common mid-life thing that college kids go through but I don’t know how to label it. I don’t feel like I’m disassociating or anything, I really just feel like I’m looking at everything in this new perspective and I don’t feel like my normal self anymore. I still enjoy doing things like riding my bike, making and playing music, playing video games, etc. But I feel like I’m counting the days down now and not making the days count. I dunno. It’s so hard to explain. Nothing is the same like it used to be, but not in a bad way I guess. Do any of you guys sort of relate? You just miss how you used to feel before?"
1747,Anxiety,Anxiety and guilt,"Today someone cut me off when I was in line for food after I was waiting for at least 30 minutes(local drive thru spot). It was 1 am and at this point I’ve been awake for around 21 hours and the meal I was waiting for was going to be my first time eating this day. I’ve never reacted so poorly to a situation. I flipped them off, I yelled at them. Now I feel so guilty and riddled with anxiety because I feel like I encouraged such a negative situation. I mostly regret it because my boyfriend was there and I feel like I made a potentially dangerous situation for him to be involved in. Long story short, people suck and I just should suck it up because involving myself in negative energy gives me crippling anxiety."
1748,Anxiety,The Jack Shephard (LOST) method: Count to 5 and allow the fear to completely give in. This has helped with my anxiety/panic attacks.,"If any of you are familiar with the show LOST, there’s a scene where Jack guides Kate through feeling fear when something has to be done. 

“Well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When I was in residency my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a sixteen year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after thirteen hours, I was closing her up and I, I accidentally ripped her dural sac, shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open and the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I... and the terror was just so crazy. So real. And I knew I had to deal with it. So I just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all I was going to give it. So I started to count: one, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.” 

I know it’s silly, because it’s a show for one, and because 5 seconds is not going to make my panic attack go away, but oddly enough, I tried this method and it actually does work for me in situations where I need my anxiety to go away. 

I was driving to see a couple of my friends a few weeks ago when all of the sudden, anxiety attack begins. I could hear my heart beat out of my chest, that impending doom feeling, the nausea, the numbing, the tingling feelings in my chest, the blurry vision, the whole shebang. I pulled over. Now, me a year ago would’ve canceled the whole thing and told my friends I couldn’t come. I’m the queen of flaking because of my anxiety and they were used to it anyway, but I was sick of this shit. I randomly thought about letting the fear just take over. I just didn’t care anymore. I felt so fed up with anxiety. I was mad. 

Instead of counting to 5, I counted to 10. Slowly. For 10 seconds I said, Eff this shit. Let it do whatever. Let it give me a heart attack! Let it hurt me! Whatever. I’m over it. For 10 seconds I didn’t think of a damn thing. I simply let the anger and the feelings consume me. I wanted to feel every bit of the fear. I invited the fear in. I just felt like this time, I’ll be angry and I’ll let anxiety rear its ugly head on me randomly. I will allow it. 

I opened my eyes and realized I was clenching my fists so hard it was leaving nail imprints. I thought about texting my friends. I thought about writing the words “sorry guys I am not feeling good today... feel super sick.” I thought about it. But there’s something empowering about being in control and letting the anxiety come. Like no, anxiety, you’re not attacking me randomly because you felt like it. I fucking ALLOWED you to attack. I’m in control here. Not you.

Maybe calling it Jack Shepard method sorta limits its reach, but I highly recommend anyone who can relate to try this. I’m a total hypochondriac also, so I always assume I’m dying. I’m just sick of feeling like I’m not in control. This method has helped me feel like I call the shots. It’s still scary but it feels more liberating when I overcome it."
1749,Anxiety,Finally got a job after so long!,"At the start of last year my anxiety took a huge toll on my mental and physical health. I ended up quitting my job at KFC and leaving University. I became super depressed and stayed home all day smoking weed and just feeling like shit.

This year however, 17 months later I’ve recovered enough to hop back into life. I scored a job at a warehouse and was let back in to University. I’m still kind of scared but at the same time I’m so happy and grateful that I was able to get stronger and move forwards.

1750,Anxiety,Anxiety about moving out of my parents house - advice???,"I lived on my own when I was 18 for about a year. At first it was terrifying and I hated it, but then I enjoyed my freedom and liked it. During this time I went through something awful and developed PTSD. I ended up with crippling anxiety and decided to move back home. I thought that this would be temporary but I never made enough money to afford an apartment while going to school (I live in an expensive city). Anyways, now I’m starting grad school (23 now), I have money saved, and the school also gave me money to pay rent. On one hand, I’m excited for something new, yet on the other, I do not feel like my mental problems are entirely resolved. I still have a lot of anxiety and it becomes exacerbated when I’m in new situations. I will potentially be moving in with a stranger by next month and I’m terrified. She has no idea I struggle with anxiety so I feel like I’m going to have to hide this side of myself. I’m also just worried about becoming isolated. It’s a big city and very intimidating. I don’t know if I’m jumping into things too quickly or if I will be able to handle it. I could postpone the move for 3 more months but I’m also not sure what good that would do me.  

Has anyone had anxiety about moving out, and how was it once you did it? Do you have any advice/recommendations?"
1751,Anxiety,“Hangover” feeling after pulling an (almost) all nighter for uni,"
Due to my unmatched procrastination skills, yesterday I had no choice but to spend 13 hours speed writing my graduation project for uni. I wrote from 1pm until 5pm, then sat again at 8pm until 5am. 

It’s now 1pm where I live, I woke up about an hour ago and I feel like crap. My anxiety is quite physical, so now I have that weird, distinct, almost nauseous feeling in my stomach. I also feel tired (but not “I want to sleep” kind of tired) and super moody and irritable.

1754,Anxiety,33 year old mom with driving anxiety - feeling hopeless,"Looking for some guidance/support. I’m really struggling with the choices and boxes I have trapped myself into. All because I’ve been too anxious to drive. i have never had a license. Never driven alone. I need to learn but it feels so impossible at this point.

I remember studying the drivers ed handbooks at 12 because I just knew I’d need more time and have to practice so much more than others. By the time I got to driving class in high school I sat out the entire time because I was too terrified to drive in front of classmates and with a teacher. I practiced a few times with my parents but for some reason stopped. I got rides with my friends all the time. Then my boyfriend and I got serious and I just rode everywhere with him. Suddenly I’m 33, have 4 kids, and still have relied on him for absolutely everything in terms of transportation. It’s created an unhealthy dynamic between us, and my kids have definitely suffered because of things I haven’t been able to take them to, sign them up for, etc. Right now I’m struggling with signing one up for preschool because I don’t know how I’ll be able to get him there.

I hate it so much. But it is so overwhelming. Now that I have the kids it’s even harder. Scheduling time, bringing them all along to practice with me... The thought of driving with them in the car adds another terrifying level to the whole thing but I can’t hire a babysitter every time I need to practice. There are too many other variables for that. I don’t live somewhere that offers driving school. To even take the driving exam for my license I’d have to fly to a different city. Which of course adds the pressure because lord what if I fail and just paid for 6 people to fly back and forth because of it? I’m so mad at myself for not learning before I had children.

Last year I made a big effort to get a move on this, I went and got my permit at 32 years old. We practiced a lot in empty parking lots. I never got better at parking. Always wide turns. I never felt comfortable being in control of a huge piece of machinery.  I know in an emergency I’d easily make the worst possible decision. I don’t trust which pedal is the brake or the gas. I feel like I’m going to press the wrong one. I feel like I can’t see around me well enough and I’m terrified of hitting a person. 

I used to have a ton of generalized/social anxiety as a teenager but I have completely overcome that! I honestly don’t feel very anxious or depressed about any other aspect of my life. I hate what a block this particular hurdle is for me. I don’t know what to do. I’m currently trying to practice again but I can’t do it alone and trying to schedule time with my husband working and four kids is....not happening easily. Time just keeps passing and I have made no progress. I feel like I trapped myself and I’m so ashamed and feel so guilty for not providing my kids with this basic option. I barely leave my neighborhood. My parents visited this last month and it was so exciting that I got to go into the grocery store since they could watch the kids. I don’t want to live like this but I don’t know what to do. I’m okay during the day but then at night I remember all I am missing and how bad this could be in an emergency. What if a child gets sick at school and I can’t get a hold of my husband at work to get them? What would I do? Just… so many things I need to drive for. I feel so helpless and ashamed."
1755,Anxiety,"Working on my Master Thesis, and missing firends reception after defence.","  

So, my first time posting, so I am not really sure what can serve as a trigger, so hope this will not include any.

I am diagnosed with the personality disorder Boderline, which means that I get more easily stressed, and have mood swings (and some other non-relevant stuff).

I have had anxiety attacks since I was a child, and sadly back then it came as violent outbursts, luckily I have my anger under control now!

I recently started having anxiety for almost entire days. It feels like there is a pain in my chest, and that it is hard to breath, even though I know there is nothing physically wrong, when it is really bad, I also start to shake. I have a feeling of wanting/needing to cry but can’t most of the time.

It has become really bad since I started working on my master thesis, the symptoms sometimes start from the moment I wake up, so even before I start working on it. I have started on medication and see a therapist sometimes, but it is a slow progress.

This of course makes it really hard to work on my thesis, and it makes me feel guilty, lazy and a bunch of other stuff, which of course only makes my anxiety even worse!

One of my friends who is a student from another country is defending her thesis tomorrow, and she is going to hold her reception outside. This would be fine except I have really bad allergies this year, which means that I can’t even open my windows. Not being able to attend makes me feel like a bad friend, which also makes me feel guilty, and also triggered my anxiety.

So, this post for me is both an outlet and a question, do any of you have any advice to how I can feel less guilty? Because I am really tired of constantly being mad at myself and disappointed."

I really liked it when I watched it so I wanted to start a conversation with her. I wrote a few words on the story reply. And then I couldn't hit send. The anxiety started coming on.

What if she thinks I'm weird if I message her after ~4 years of not talking? And in the midst of thinking all of that I accidentally hit send. She hasn't seen it yet it's been 43 minutes. I haven't unsent the message yet because I want to prove to myself that I'm not a little bitch who's scared of everything."

1763,Anxiety,"The paradox: the more I learn, collect knowledge or meet people, the less I know about the world and it makes me aware how stupid I actually am","Living unaware of how the actual world works is such a blessing.

The more knowledge I get, the less I get comfortable and calm. When I go outside, collect knowledge, learn new things and I'm getting proud of it, there's always a person smarter or doing better. There's always more knowledge to get, more things to do, more experiences to get.

I like to learn about anything. When I start it's amazing, I'm interested and things are going well untill I start to see how many things are left to get to know and how many people are better than I am. It's frustrating. I start many things but never complete and get anxious.

I compare my intelligence to many people on a daily basis. I think that everyone is smarter than me, know more things or do better. I'm confident about my looks and anyone can't tell me anything how I look because I know I look good, but my intelligence is questionable. I'm an engineer right now, doing Master's but I feel like a fraud and I shouldn't be here. Comparing to my peers, I'm a though learner, I'm very slowly and my brain can't process knowledge really fast. I'm not autistic, dialectic or anything, it's more of a matter of my anxiousness about my intelligence. Under the stress I shut down and say nothing amongst people, even if we work in pairs at my university. I hate anything connected to checking out my knowledge, any kinds of exams, tests ect.

When I was young, my parents used to tell me how stupid I am and how many things I get wrong. When I pour out my tea for example, that's another reason for my parents to prove how wrong is everything I do and why I can't do good at life. It's sad.


There are still somewhere (for example in Africa) villages of  with people living in tents, under the rocks, without electricity, phones, cars ect. They have no idea who's current President of the USA or how to calculate integers. They hunt, sew, eat, drink, sleep, spend time with family, feed animals, play  How happy those people are? I might say the happiest ones.

The most miserable ones are CEOs of big companies, lawyers, doctors, engineers because they know too much. They've seen too much. They've got too many things to get done. 

Is it only me or do people have the same feelings as me?"

1765,Anxiety,Anxious about upcoming MRI,"CW: Health/Medical topic

So, I had some health problems last year that wound up with me sent to the ER on suspicion of a stroke (persistent scotoma in vision and partial facial droop) where they did a CT scan that came back clear but recommended me to a neurologist who examined me and then wrote up an order for me to get an MRI done with and without contrast on my brain. 

The MRI is scheduled for next week (Monday 7th June) and I'm very anxious about it. Not so much about the results of the scan - it's possible that they'll find white matter lesions that could indicate MS or something similar, but honestly it would just be a relief to find answers for all the weird symptoms I've had for years now that culminated in the ER visit. I'm more just nervous about the MRI itself.

I've had one done before, when my gallbladder imploded, and it was very uncomfortable and loud and, yes, claustrophobic. 45 minutes in a tunnel with banging and screeching noises all around. Most of all, I hate having an IV put in (which I had to have during my ER visit, so I recently recall how much I hated it) which they'll have to do for the contrast dye. And the hospital is an hour's drive away so the whole thing just feels like it's going to suck. I've been trying to take my mind off of it, but I keep looping back around to it, having nightmares, feeling on edge. I just want it to be over. It's not soon enough to be almost done, but not far enough away to not worry about it, you know?

I guess this is more just a vent than anything else. Thanks for listening."

1771,Anxiety,I am excessively dependant on exercise to cope with my Anxiety.,"I have had body issues as a teenager due to mild bullying in school regarding my body shape. They did not fully go away, however, even in my adulthood. During the lockdown (roughly a year ago) I discovered the realm of fitness and became deeply engrossed in it. It became my means of feeling good about myself and staying more in control of things. However, I have been noticing since a while ago that whenever I am unable to exercise (even if it is a genuine reason like sickness, fatigue, etc.) I feel deeply guilty and anxious. Worst part is, all of this anxiety affects me at night, right when I go to bed. How do I cope with this feeling of losing control over my body which I have developed with this practice of exercising ?"
1772,Anxiety,Agoraphobia over leaving your home town?,"I have no problem leaving my house to go for a walk or just to do some errands around town or something, but it's more when I'm leaving town.

I just can't stop thinking about planning out every step of my day and cycling through it over and over again in my head.

The silly thing is it's sooo much better if it's just spontaneous and I leave for something the same day (can't have a bad night if you don't need to sleep, right?)

Part of it is driving.  I'm definitely less anxious if I know I'm getting a ride instead.  I actually enjoy driving, but I get anxious about it nonetheless.

Do I deserve his amazing family too? I also feel like as I get older I reflect on my childhood trauma and am realizing just how bad it really was.

1774,Anxiety,ANXIETY IS A SIGN OF A FAILURE OF EXPRESSING YOUR EMOTIONS,"When one get anxious especially without a reason this is most of the time a sign of a failure of digesting your Emotions especially your aka negative Emotions such as shame, guilt, anger, wishes .. 
Those Emotions have a reason in first place which is to be communicated or digested ( feeling them without any judgement or denying ) .. so basically your Relationship with your Emotions dictate your Psychological health. 

Now let's talk a bit about how shame influence your life and break you into pieces and make you fragmented and depressed .. 

Shame means ( I am wrong ) so there's a self hate going on without your realization, so your body doesn't speak English, the only way it will communicate with you is via Anxiety or a lack of motivation or apathy .. 
The mistake most guys I meet are making is they try to get rid of the anxiety by taking medications or escaping it by keeping themselves busy all the time .. all you're doing here is making your condition worst and it will come back 10 times harder and who knows you may experience a Psychological breakdown, so in my opinion if you're suffering from Anxiety or the conditions I mentioned above you should dive deep into your Emotions and feel them as painful as they are without any identification or dramatization .. the more you welcome those Emotions the more they'll lose their power .. many of you are asking so how do I dive deeply into those scary painful Emotions or Anxiety, there's a process it's called the revealing process .. it has to do with walking the Emotional scale from apathy which is the lowest Emotion until peace which is the highest Emotional level a person could function in .. I hope you guys got some value from this post ;)"

I think the best way to explain what I’m trying to say is, let’s say a short person walked into a room full of tall people, you are going to feel short and down about yourself, it’s kinda similar only it’s with my anxiety like I can’t always be that mentally balanced, if that makes any sense.

It's become second nature to think, ""Am I oversharing? Am I being kind? If I say this, will I regret it later?"" When I found out that this isn't something that happens to everyone, I couldn't believe it. There are people out there who don't do this??

1778,Anxiety,Chin numbness,"Didnt know where to post this but im pretty worried so if anyone knows what im talking about please give your opinion or personal experience. 

A month-ish ago i was in the bus, leaned on my left hand with a hand supporting my chin/head when i randomly noticed my whole chin and bottom lip went numb. Once i got home the numbness in my lip went away but the chin one still persisted. It was mostly on and off, as in if i forgot about it, doing some other stuff like housework i wouldnt notice it was there, but the moment i remembered it it would come back. Tomorrow it was completely gone. 

Yesterday i was at the mall and i noticed that i got some sort of cramp in my left foot and i felt a chill run through the left side of my body and then my left arm went numb. After a bit of time my arm stopped being numb and my chin started numbing again. Tomorrow (today) it started numbing again. 

Then, both times it happened i of course went to google and ran into NCS ( numb chin syndrome ) which in short is a sign of a very deadly form of cancer and most people diagnosed with it die shortly after. Of course i cant help but feel anxious even thought theres a bunch of stuff written on the internet and without professional help i cant know anything for sure. Still im worried. 

Some things i should note are that im overall healthy, Im 20yo and female, slightly overweight but it hasnt caused any problems apart from physical appearance, i havent had any health problems recently or overall, but i did feel a small tiny bump on my left breast that hurts when i press it ( i didnt check it out though because of the whole covid thing). There arent any other symptoms except for ocassional headaches that i never had up until a year ago, but i think thats because of my sleep schedule drastically changing during that year and every few days ( plus the often weather changes).

Hopefully someone could tell me something about this, if its just in my head or maybe i should visit a doctor, although i dont know which one would be the best option. Thanks in advance, hopefully i flared this correctly."
1779,Anxiety,20 y.o. Never had a job. Feeling «excluded».,"For context i’ve been plagued by anxiety most of my youth-years, and am just now getting better.

I’m anxious for my economy, my future and how people will react when they find out.

Anyone in the same place as me? Any advice?

I’ve even had two therapists tell me now that they didn’t fully understand why I was going to therapy at first because I seemed like I was fine. 

It just takes me a while to open up to people, even my relatives tell me that I’m such a chill and easy going person, but the reality is that I’m not far from crying at any moment if a situation doesn’t go the way I expect it to. I’m pretty much using all of my energy to act normal in social situations so people don’t realize I have anxiety. 

Does anyone relate to this? I’ve come to the conclusion that a lot of people with anxiety are just really good at “acting” because you kind of have to in order to function in social situations sometimes. Idk just something I’ve been thinking about lately."

1793,Anxiety,Issues with a coworker...,"I’m a music teacher, and I run my own orchestra program at my school. I have to work closely with the band and choir teachers at my school, especially during concert months, recruitment, and scheduling. 

However, my philosophy on music education is SO different than one of my coworkers, and we can’t seem to agree on anything. There’s little to no district guidance. I think this is so that there is greater teacher autonomy, but it has us at a standstill in a pretty bitter disagreement over scheduling. 

I have never felt respected by my coworker since first starting my job last school year. When I said I would attempt a certain teaching strategy, she said she wouldn’t do that but I could if I wanted it to crash and burn. I don’t remember what it was now, but I remember my lesson being successful. 

She tells me I have issues in communication, and it almost turns into gaslighting. For example, this past week she told me that I just sprung this certain plan on her, and I needed to tell her sooner about it. I told her that what I had said was always my plan and that I’d been saying it all along. She made me doubt
myself. When I vented about the situation to my mom, even my mom remembers me complaining about the same issue months ago, and she told me that I did in fact talk about her reaction when I said that plan in the first place. 

She often excludes my other music colleague for meetings because it “doesn’t pertain to him”, but I often tell him the run down, and the fact that she’s requested those meetings with me. 

She complains about “impromptu meetings” when myself or my colleague are just trying make conversation, which tends to be about music because that’s clearly what we enjoy and have in common. Then, she tries to schedule meetings that will last an hour or longer on less than a day’s notice. 

I spent hours on a scheduling spreadsheet for our team, and then she decides to make her own version of the same thing and declares that this spreadsheet is the one we’re using now.

When I made a concert schedule to share to all building teachers and staff, which all music teachers have editing rights to in order to put in their own schedules, she decided to change the wording on both my schedule and my coworker’s because it was “too confusing”. We both ended up having to take time out of our day to undo what she had done. 

She sends a RIDICULOUS amount of emails, and it’s driving me and some other staff members insane. Some are really passive aggressive towards me. For example, she was in her office sending me an email and cc’ing admin about the most minor issue she had with one of my students, and she could have just popped her head out of her office and talked to me about it. 

Now she’s trying to take students away from my program for the sake of “having even numbers”. I just want to focus on teaching, and that’s stressful in itself.  But my coworker is shifting my focus to all of these smaller details and fundamental differences. It’s burning me out so quickly. It causes me to doubt myself and my abilities. My admin and other coworkers frequently praise me for a job well done, so I know I’m a good teacher, but she makes me feel like crap, even though she’s losing students left and right due to her attitude and teaching style. 

The only thing that is keeping my going right now is knowing that I have one more year left at my district before I go to grad school. One more year, and I’m out. I love my school, and I love my students, but working with this person showed me that I need to take care of myself too. And it’s hard to do that in a toxic work environment. My anxiety has been through the roof this year, and there’s definitely a correlation between the control she’s trying to assert over my program and my anxiety in general. I know my anxiety won’t just go away when I get out of this environment, but soon I’ll have the energy to be able to work on myself and focus on getting better."
1794,Anxiety,I feel myself questioning everything lately. It's hard to understand my anxiety even for myself.,"I find myself feeling like I am sitting in my own head watching a movie of my own life. Like I am just along for the ride.

Questioning my place in time and history, wondering what my life would be like if the smallest details changed or I made the other decision. I question my job especially lately on its level of bullshit. I work in sales and the job could easily be replaced by an iPad. I question human interaction the most. 

I was wondering if someone could tell me I am not that weird and that you deal with the same issues. Maybe I could just ask questions like how you deal with it."

1796,Anxiety,Getting vaccinated soon with health issues.,"I work from home and don't have much support. I'm scared if the symptoms hit me too hard I'll get fired. I'm scared if I get fired I'll end up homeless and without healthcare since finding a job with a disability is terribly difficult. I've been homeless in the past so it's a reality that's very much in my mind at all times.    

I faint easily. I get moments where I feel so sick I just crumple to the floor in and out of consciousness choking on vomit and convulsing.   I also get severe vertigo attacks where it feels like the room is spinning fast but it sometimes doesn't let up for 20 hours so I start to hallucinate and black out from stress.    

I'm so scared."
1797,Anxiety,I'm trying.,"I was doing.. okay until I got a sinus infection last week and since then I've been in full anxiety and panic attack mode. I'm starting to pick myself back up, and get going again but it's just not going as fast as I'd like. I breathed my way out of a panic attack ten minutes ago, so that's something but I just want to feel normal again. Is there anything you do to help pick yourself back up and get going again?"
1798,Anxiety,Anyone here sensitive to loud noises?,So I live with my parents and typically the house is pretty quiet. I'm a very emotionally sensitive person so my routines are very important to me and I don't like change. My sister and her family and pet have moved in with us. Its only been 3 days and I'm having a hard time adjusting. There's so much noise and chaos. Our house is quite small and the noise travels. You can't escape the noise. I have nowhere to go. I'm stuck here. Anyone have any advice on how to cope? I'm so overwhelmed.
1799,Anxiety,does anyone else get anxiety when walking behind people?,"It’s so weird but so crippling lol. whenever i go outside, i’m constantly overthinking what i look like, from someone else’s POV. and i keep thinking what if i see someone i know, and it’s just so overwhelming. I also HATE walking behind someone, even at a distance. I get so fucking worked up over the fact they might think i’m following them that it just freaks me out.

context; i live on a campus on university and i havent been diagnosed with anxiety but goddamnit it sure feels like i have it. I also have extreme anxiety to a point where, if people are in the kitchen at my university, i won’t eat. like if people are chilling in the kitchen ( i live in shared kitchen accommodation) i’ll more than happily not eat that night, cos i don’t want to be seen by anyone due to self image issues.

i’m a 19 year old man and i can’t even go outside the front door without worrying people are out to get me. shits fucked. anyone else? lol.

also does this sound like anxiety or another disorder.

1800,Anxiety,Would I have noticed or heard a bat flying outside my window?,"Okay so I opened my window to cool myself, and I my fingers that have open wounds went under the window a little to open it more. It’s nighttime, basically midnight. But now I’m paranoid that a rabid bat spit on my fingers. Would I have heard it? Thank you. I also don’t live in a rural area either."
1801,Anxiety,Doctor told me there's nothing wrong with me?,"So, for about 2 in a half years now, I've had this extremely discomforting feeling in my chest almost every time after I've eaten a decent sized meal. It feels like the food is stuck in my esophagus or something, and I get really gassy and I can feel the food regurgitating and almost coming back up while it's happening. This discomfort usually lasts between 30min - 1hr. I can also feel my heart beating extremely hard. I went to a doctor for it right around when it started happening, they told me nothing was wrong. Then it went away for 3 months, then it came back. Went to the doctor again for it, and once again did lab tests, an EKG, etc. They found nothing still. She prescribed me Lexapro for this because she thinks it's my anxiety. I don't think it is, something to me just feels physically wrong in my chest when the discomfort happens after I eat, ofc, I get really anxious when it happens because it scares me and makes me feel like I'm dying. What should I do?"
1802,Anxiety,My anxiety is starting to get worse because it’s almost summer,"I have been feeling like garbage whenever it’s really warm outside, I have experienced a handful of panic attacks and I have been diagnosed with GAD and Panic Disorder and I noticed that every single panic attack I have had was during the summer, one time was on a walk, one was during a 5k run, and a few others as well, could this be PTSD from those past panic attacks? Also I had a panic attack while in a car in the summer with the windows down so now everytime the windows are down in a car I get extremely anxious and panicky. I hope someone can help because I am gonna have months and months of dealing with this now until it’s winter again."
1803,Anxiety,My psychiatrist is amazing but out of network,"I have an amazing psych who is out of network. I have health insurance but he doesn’t take mine (or any). All the in network psychs I’ve been to suck. They will give me the pills that I do need but they will not explore any farther than that. They just want the insurance payout from pharma, and to get that they write scripts but don’t care enough to assess any root problems. 

But this out of network guy is great, but he charges $250 for an hourly session (and this is already a discount from his normal rates). I told myself that I will do this once a month for my own mental health, for now. I am able to do this financially but it is not easy. It definitely is a big expense. I’m not going to starve over it but $250 a month is a big chunk of change to have to shelve out. 

Just venting. Shit sucks. Wish i didn’t have to spend for this, wish I was just well. But ik it’s a cost i have to eat for my own mental health) Just frustrated."
1804,Anxiety,I want to do things but I can't seem to make myself on my own,"I've always liked the idea of streaming or uploading youtube videos where I just play games with a group of people. I play some LoL and Minecraft and I'd be happy to try others if I find a group to play with. I'm kind of hopeful since more content creators aren't using face cams, which would make me much more comfortable. I'm slowly trying to work myself up to it like recording short videos to send to my brother but it's pretty slow lol.

I hit a roadblock when I realized something I struggle with. I so badly want more friends and I do my best to talk to people and be open. But I caught myself thinking about how I don't want them to depend on me to come and hang out if I'm having a bad day (which I've had more of lately). Like some days it's difficult for me to talk a lot and that makes most people uncomfortable. I think I'd work best in a fairly big group of friends so I'm not under as much stress to carry a conversation. I also struggle with trusting that people will still like me once they get to know me or 'once they know how messed up I am'. I know this isn't a good way of thinking. I don't know how to get past it, though.

For anyone in the mcyt community, Wilbur Soot said that Tommy helped him a lot by asking him to get in a call and play. I don't have anyone like that and I'm really hoping I can find someone someday. None of my friends play games or ask to play. They just notice that I'm not okay and (from their past experience with me) leave me alone to get over it. I'm not good with emotions so they don't usually know how to help me. A lot of my growing process has had to happen through myself.

I've had a breakthrough recently, though! I asked one of my best friends to room with me in college, so I'm hoping that we'll get closer and I'll also be able to open up more. I've been hopping between a couple of therapists to work on talking about my feelings and trusting people. I think I've gotten a lot better. It's still kind of crushing though to not feel like I have any real friends. Even some of my newer friends at school ask me to come hang out a few times and when they see my reluctance (basically just fear of feeling bad or ruining the mood) they don't want to make me uncomfortable. They stop asking as much. I feel like I'm making a cycle that I can't get out of no matter how much I want to.

How do I find a group of friends? 

This feels so weird to ask. I usually end up being kind of adopted by people so I'm not the best at seeking new people on my own. Plus, them knowing in advance might help but I don't want that to be all they think of me. I have good days and bad but once people find out I have strong anxiety it's all they tend to see. This is rambly, sorry"
1805,Anxiety,Feeling kinda crappy,I wanna travel for my 21st birthday but I can’t really afford it. I only make 8.50 an hour as a cashier and I’m saving for a car so I can get a better job. I was planning it with my friend but then I realized damn I can’t afford it and I told them this but they don’t seem to I guess care since they make way more than me and they wanna go. I feel sad because I wanna go but I’m also kinda upset  because  like I’m sorry I realized I won’t be able to afford it after all and priorities changed .
1806,Anxiety,"I feel like I’m in a video game; Tw// Disassociation, existentialism","To start off, I have dyslexia so a sorry in advance for spelling 

I have diagnosed ocd and anxiety; along with depression but it dosnt have a play in this 

I am disassociated with reality. This starts a few months back, my first instances of true disassociation. My mind would escape, I couldn’t feel attached to the real world. But I’d snap back. It was something that happened occasionally, I don’t have social anxiety however sometimes my “social meter” runs empty and I’d disassociate. 

Moving on to the past week or so, I feel like I’m not me, I’m not in the right place. It started off at target, I heard a man on the phone, and it sent a chill down my spine, the way he talked on the phone sounded like a npc character. “Then she said that, so I said this, and we did that” The conversation he was having made absolutely no sence, i can’t explain it but it was insanely generic. I asked my friend about it and she acknowledged it was weird and moved on. But I couldn’t stop thinking about it

Fast forward to today, time went by in a weird way, the day seemed so long, I don’t know how, but it was. I went to a festive, and a few hours felt like a few minutes yet several hours all at once. I drove to target later, took a wrong turn, yet still ended up at the location, from the same exact entrance. I completely detached from my body, I was so confused, so lost. I had never felt so wrong. In explaining this to my friend I completely glitched. I couldn’t form words or sentences and she just told me I was crazy. 

This event made me recount other events, such as having weird dreams. I never had dreams prior, however the past few days iv been having dreams non stop about horrible things, such as me dying, except one of my dreams, I died in a car accident, this dream felt too real, I began to question if I did die, and switched to a new universe. I got paranoid, I began thinking maybe there are higher ups, controlling my mind, me, my thought. The Inter fear when I say the wrong things. These thoughts are becoming obsessive. I feel like everyone who dismisses my ideas are working with the higher ups, against me. 

Deep down, I know this is all nonsense, however, I can’t help but obsess over it. Everyone is a npc, and I’m just a main character, everything is for me, anything out of my view isn’t programmed, everything is a program. I’m stuck in this game, I feel trapped, I don’t know if any of this makes sence. Please how can I control the paranoia and anxiety. 

To clarify I have no thoughts of hurting anyone including myself, and if I do will immediately seek help, simply saying this because my friend was concerned about it earlier so I wanted to clarify it here aswell. I simply just feel paranoid and uncomfortable, I know This is absurd but it’s my current obsession. 

Please comment or ask questions or offer advice 

TLDR: I feel like I’m Truman from the Truman show and it’s freaking me out"
1807,Anxiety,waking up with extreme anxiety,"for the past few months especially, i have been waking up at 5 am abruptly with anxiety and it's been happening every single night (or day i should say). i don't know why the anxiety hits so bad in the morning when i need to start my day. does anyone else have this problem as well?"
1808,Anxiety,Anxiety makes me physically sick?,"Okay so I’m wondering if it is common to feel nauseous and dizzy when y’all get anxious? Today had been hell and there is one particular moment from today that has circled my head and it just keeps circling. Anyway, it’s made me so anxious and jumpy that every time I try to eat, I feel like I’m going to vomit. I can’t hold still or shut my mind off so I’m going to try taking a hot shower to relax."
1809,Anxiety,Separation anxiety,"I (22f) think I might have some sort of separation anxiety.

Some episodes in my life might have trigger it. For example, I spent almost a year without my dad during my teenage years because he was studying abroad. That was tough, I was angry at my mom all the time and cried almost single day.

I think about my loved ones dying all the time. Sometimes when I'm walking home I start wondering  how would it be if I get home and find someone dead, and usually I cry non stop like a baby and it's uncontrollable.

A few years ago I had a long distance relationship, and we spent some weekends together but when he had to leave I broke down fearing it would be the last time we were together.

Now I'm in a relationship and we live in the same city. We're together all the time. We still live with our parents but sometimes we rent airbnbs during the weekend so we can be alone. I think we will make it work when we move together. It's always great but I get really anxious when it's time to leave. Tomorrow he will be sleeping at my place (my parents are okay with that) but I'm suffering from anticipation because I know I'll be sad as soon as he leaves the next morning."
1810,Anxiety,I’m terrified to leave the house,"Before COVID, I had made SO much progress on my anxiety over the course of about 2-3 years. I was doing SO much better. Flash forward to now, since July 2020, I’ve only left the house TWICE. The first time, I started driving around town in October. I had to drive back home because I started having a panic attack at a stop light (I felt trapped). The second time was was visit some relatives for Christmas. It was also my first time eating out since June. Although I had no appetite because I was so anxious.
Now, I’m watching a YouTube video where a girl went to a crafts store to get stuff for a DIY. It made me remember all the times I went to Michaels to get supplies to try new things and what not. It made me so sad realizing that I’ve lost all my progress. My anxiety has paralyzed me. I just want to go drive to a restaurant and get a sandwich, but I’m scared of everything. Driving? Anxious. Waiting for my food? Anxious. 
It’s not even because of COVID. I just feel trapped, get anxious when I don’t have access to a toilet (because of emetophobia), and masks make me anxious because I feel like I can’t breathe even if I know I’m ok. I’m exhausted. 
I can’t continue to live like this forever but I don’t know how to help myself again. I’m tired of panic attacks."
1811,Anxiety,Anxiety over details when it comes to characters?? Is this weird?,"So I just wanna know whether it's due to me having anxiety (diagnosed) or just me thing, but when I don't have all the details of a character whether it's in a game, book, a doll, etc. I can't enjoy stuff and it's extremely frustrating. Does anyone else deal with this? It isn't like something that just annoys me, I literally cannot think about or proceed to read about or look at a certain character until I know their age, gender, ethnicity, race, background, etc. or else I just keep annoying other people for answers or searching the internet all night, which I assume is annoying as hell to others."
1812,Anxiety,Anxiety and motivation around exercise,"I wanted to see if anyone has advice for dealing with exercise. I know exercise is healthy and good to do for dealing with anxiety and depression, but it’s kind of embarrassing and basically i’m so unfit that even short amounts of cardio makes my heart pump so much I get light headed and feel like i’m going to pass out. So working out makes me feel like i’m having a panic attack which is very fun. I know there’s alternative ways to exercising like strength and yoga but I really want to be able to do cardio too without feeling like i’m going to die. I also get really anxious to do exercise and basically avoid it and it takes so much external motivation (like my friends making me do it with them) in order for me to do it. Does anyone relate?"
1813,Anxiety,Anxiety for 6 years,"Well i had my first panic attack 6 years ago (almost 7) it was when i almost choked on my food and spent 1 year surviving off liquids (i was scared to choke on solids and die) i beated my phobia by forcing myself to eat slowly until i went back to normal bu anxiety was still there and i started having panic attacks with my heart racing, feeling dizzy, blurry vision, ears beeping, breathing too quick etc, i developed what is known as health anxiety after 6 months of constant panic attacks thinking my heart was failing, got tests done my health was ok my heart was perfect and well i still have this moments where i notice something in my body that is normal and i think ""it's cancer im fucked"" or i cough a bit because im a smoker and i think ""oh god its covid im gonna die"" and like this with EVERYTHING. Today i was playing a videogame and i heard a bird outside my windows but i had a moment of not knowing what the sound was and my brain associated it with ""im dying"" idk how or why, i wanted to know what could help me with my health anxiety because its really affecting me, ive developed a lot of fears like flying (im scared ill suffer a heart attack, stroke or something on the plane and ill get no medical aid) sport (i feel my heart accelerated and my brain associates it with anxiety) and like this i have a lot of fears, next week im moving to the US and i have 17h of flights ahead of me (which has me terrified) so i was wondering if anyone could give me some advice because atm if my head hurts for a second i automatically think ""a stroke im dying"" and i associate normal pains or feelings with death diseases or my death. 
I dont wanna be a drama queen but i havent enjoyed life for the past 6 years and im only 26 so its kinda driving me nuts because i really need some advice on how to stop this mindset of always negativity and thinking of the worst case scenario i need to reeducate my mind and idk how.

Thanks"
1814,Anxiety,Severe sense of dread,"TW: mention of drugs

This probably won’t be very well put together, but for a while I have been having the feeling of shame and dread that one gets when they know they have done something wrong or when they’ve embarrassed themselves. I don’t know how very well to describe it, but I would compare it to a sense of dread or impending doom.

Like when I am doing something I enjoy or something that would normally be fun, productive, or happy, I feel like I am just pretending everything is okay when it isn’t. Like I am just going through the motions of being okay when I am not, and in reality everything around me is actually very bad.

I know this entire thing is all in my head and that many of my worries are only perceived. But when I’m cleaning or cooking for my partner, I feel like I’m pretending our relationship is good when it’s not. When I’m around his or my family or talking to my friends, I have a sense of not belonging or that I’m intruding.

I’m 19 years old and I’ve been on adderall for ADHD for a little over a year. I don’t take it everyday because it makes it hard for me to sleep and I have an aversion to pills, but my inability to focus without it is actually embarrassing. When I was younger I tried several types of antidepressants but quit taking them when I was 16.

Over the past year, I’ve tried several recreational drugs including acid and mdma. I know a lot of people recommend weed for anxiety but I hate the way it makes me feel. I don’t need you to tell me I was stupid for trying drugs, but I know that I’ve damaged my brain somehow and now the adderall reacts with me the same way a molly comedown does, I feel hopeless and like the illusion I created of how good things were is gone. I no longer use the drugs because of my mental health and I have never abused my adderall, but now I dread taking it because of the “comedown” feeling of hopelessness. I didn’t realize how bad my mental health was until I started having unpleasant reactions.

A lot of changes have happened in my life recently, a new job, a new car, and a new puppy. Despite there being a lot of good things in my life, I can’t help but have these feelings like I’m only pretending to be happy and nothing is as good as it seems in my head. Or like something bad is about to happen that is going to make me very depressed. I guess I just don’t know what to do to make these feelings go away. I feel like if I take my adderall I will have to take something to counteract the heightened anxiety it gives me.

I’m sorry that this was such a long post, but I feel like I’m losing my direction and just needed to get this off my chest. Any kind words would be very appreciated"
1815,Anxiety,So anxious thinking about possible health problem I start “imagining” or “initiating” symptoms to match my problem,It’s horrible....does anyone else do this?
1816,Anxiety,"Does anyone become hyper aware when they hear their name or certain ""trigger"" words?","So I spend most of my days in my room watching ideas or listening to music and my parents usually spend most of their time in the kitchen/dining room while my brother spends his time in the living room. There is ALWAYS some sort of noise going on. Whether its my parents talking or watching stuff on their laptop or my brother being all loud on his Xbox.

I hear them pretty much all day but I don't pay attention and the noise goes in one wear and out the other, but when I hear my name I immediately perk up and hear everything. Its like Im passively listening but my brain only turns on when I hear my name. 

It also happens with ""trigger"" words I guess. I have really bad hypochondria and my current thing is Lymes disease from ticks. I just heard my brother say ticks for whatever reason and I became fully aware and comprehensive of his conversation. 

Does anyone else work like that?"
1817,Anxiety,Today I successfully went to the gym.,"I have been planning to go to the gym for a very long time. Since last year actually. And today, I went by myself! 

I moved from my home at 8.00am and arrived 15mins later. But I didn't immediately go into the gym. I stayed in the car for about half an hour waiting for I don't know what. I was nervous, you know? I'm going to this gym alone, so I needed some motivation in my head haha. But then, my stomach started to ache and so I went back home for a bit. By 10am, I was still at home thinking about going to the gym. One minute very motivated to go, one minute deciding to cancel. Its a mess inside my head. Suddenly, my brother decided he want to go to the bank so he will send me to the gym. Along the way, I was just thinking what I should do when I reach, what I should say. It was nerve-wrecking. When we reached, he dropped me off and went his way. So now I have no option but to go up to the gym hurhur...  Its not that I'm nervous exercising in a gym, but more about interacting with other humans. Seriously, its like, wherever I go, the receptionist people are always sooo angry? Like their face is just not approachable? That's why I'm always nervous whenever going to somewhere where we have to register like dentist, clinics, post office or wherever.  When I went inside, luckily there were only a few people there (it is 11am on monday so...) Talked with the guy at the counter. Almost cried just by trying to talk to him but luckily I didn't because if I did, you're never gonna see me there again. Anyways, he was very friendly and nice, and he showed around the gym and how to use certain equipments. Had an enjoyable time at the gym. Now Im already home and feeling fresh and grateful to the gym bros there that helped me.

I hope this story can motivate anyone who is anxious going somewhere. Just calm down, take your time and go to your destination. It might not be bad and actually improve your day :)"
1818,Anxiety,anxiety/perfectionism induced procrastination,"Personally I find that my perfectionism is pretty closely tied in to my anxiety. And often this leads to me procrastinating on activities because I’m overwhelmed and I don’t even know where to begin, or want to begin.

I wish I didn’t do this so much. Because it makes me anxious to procrastinate on work I have to do but it also makes me anxious to attempt said work… lose lose!

Does anyone else experience this?"
1819,Anxiety,Feeling Some Kind of Way,"So I’ll be the first to admit, I was on vacation this weekend and things got so hectic I forgot to take my anxiety medicine two nights in a row....and now I’m paying for it. All day today I was extremely dizzy and dissociative....while driving us home on an 8 hours road trip. I knew the dizziness was harmless so I bucked up and powered through it. However, we got traffic in a notoriously congested spot and I was agitated....SUPER agitated. It was to the point I was pissed at anyone remotely close to my rear or who thought hauling a** and coming up behind me just to change lanes at the last possible second really ticked me off. 

Well, we get in at 11 at night only to find something of ours put to the side...not in the trash but like, the way I got home and saw it was just removed from its spot that it had been as a decoration for a year by my roommate and good friend...basically, it’s a yard decoration of the breed of dog we just put to sleep a few months back...And I get it-she’s got her a new man, they got their thing going on and I know it wasn’t intentional. But still...this picture was painted before I moved in with her that we were going to be a family and she’s got this dude now and it’s as if we are just a hindrance to them. Like, the plan is as a 5-10 year plan and now I feel like they can’t get rid of us soon enough...which we weren’t prepared for based on the previously 5-10 year plan discussion/assumption

. Anywho, back to the moment at hand....I lost it....Not externally but I just quickly went to a sad, dark place. Could they have at least mentioned that when I was texting them wishing they were with us on vacation? I know it wasn’t on purpose and I’m sure I’m just really in my emotions because of the unintentional withdrawal (I finally put two and two together and looked up symptoms) but it was a punch in the gut. I just feel this physical hurt and it reopened the feelings I had been working so hard to process in dealing with the grief of losing our boy. 

Then of course it just brought up the feelings of being forgotten, feelings of being a burden, feelings of abandonment I’m currently trying to work through because of my biological father (the man literally threw everything away for a brand new family 20 years ago).  Sometimes I wonder if I made a mistake coming here. But I have a full time job and thank goodness because I accepted it just prior to covid and I know we would be financially ruined had we remained with me working part time. 

I’m now at the point that I’m so tired but can’t sleep-and I have work tomorrow, so I’m hoping I can use that to distract myself until I’m back in track with my dosage.

But then I started thinking-am I so messed up that two days of no meds and I’m an emotional lunatic? Like, it takes medication for me to be “normal???” 

This weekend was beautiful. I couldn’t have asked for a better time with my best friend and her family and I couldn’t have asked for a nicer unit reunion for my husband and his Army family. And now we are back home and I’m just in this space."
1820,Anxiety,Fear of Unknown Person,"Everytime I go to my Grandma's old house (she's still alive, but in assisted living), I have such an irrational fear of someone being there. I don't know why but I'm always glancing around corners, scared to go in the basement, and terrified when I hear any noise. I'm always looking back scared someone is going to be behind me or someone has snuck in during the days/weeks period I haven't been to the house. It being nighttime greatly amplifies this feeling and sleeping there alone at night is incredibly tough. I hate not just being able to relax and constantly thinking about this fear when I'm there. I don't know how to really get over this irrational fear. Any tips?"

Of you actually existing. 

You are so blessed to be on this Earth.

You may not love every single second of being here, you may question why you were brought into this world...

But you have a purpose in life.

You don’t get to see yourself from another person’s perspective. You don’t get to see what you look like when you’re doing something fun you enjoy, how focused you get into a video game...or how happy you look while petting a dog... how incredibly amazing you actually are. 

Through all the; hard times, the greatest of all times, and the winded storms, the ground shacking downfalls... 

You’ve lived through it all. 

You still get yourself up out of bed, and push through to another day... 

Do you know how bad a** that actually is? 

**Your mental illness does not define you. Your strength, and courage does.** - yes, its a quote we’ve probably all heard... but speaking up about your mental illness, talking to someone, talking about it... you do not know how great that actually is. 

You do not know how widespread your post actually goes...until it goes. With one click of a “post” button - like I’ve mentioned before in a previous post on here -  .. you are changing not only your life by talking to the whole world about it...but also helping someone who is going through the same thing, yet is afraid to post, or comment, and just “lurks, and reads” ... 

So just continue to be you. Be yourself, and you will always be in fashion. 

Post in the subs you enjoy, and don’t be afraid to post on here... there are so many people on this singular subreddit...and tons of other people on reddit, that are there to help you out. 

Wanna help someone else out ? 

In 3 simple steps, you can make another persons day better... yes, you’re a stranger to them. But 3 simple steps. 

1. Click on post. - Read post (okay, this doesnt count as a step) 

2. Click on profile name 

3. Say “hope you’re having an amazing day” or something along the lines to let them know, that you know, that they exist..and you hear them out... just by saying (well, messaging) that! It’s appreciative, and will make em smile.

...One in 400 trillion... 

You’re you - and you’re so unique. 

While you want to change little things about yourself you absolutely hate...another person loves it. 

Just be the person you’ve always been. Never change. The real people will love who you are, and stay in your life, and make a huge impact in.

—————-

You got this kings , and queens. 

Keep your head up. You don’t want those crowns, and tiaras falling off. 

......

Just remember; one in 400 trillion... there was you. You were brought here for a reason - you may not know it yet... or why... but you were.

Have a good night / day wherever you live. 

Hope all is going well for you.

1822,Anxiety,I typed out my anxiety attack and thought I should share it,"I recently got into a little habit where when things get overwhelming I’d go over to a solo chat that I have on WhatsApp to vent and attempt to clear my mind. The following text occurred when I responded to a friend’s concerning status message and I regretted it. I don’t know why but I felt like sharing this might be helpful or something? Idk. I found it interesting to have my thought process in text so I decided to share it. Not sure if I flaired it right but I guess it fits 🤷🏽‍♀️ 




I hate this I hate this I hate this!!! I can’t do it! C*** needs some reassurance right now but I can’t give it to her! I can’t understand what I should do. I don’t know what she’s feeling. I failed courses too but I don’t even react to it, it’s just meh for me! I touched the glass, my precious snow globe, I put another crack in it! It’s going to break, I’m such a horrible friend. Am I even a friend? I feel a hurricane of emotions deep down inside me but I’m not feeling anything on the first few layers. I’m just blank faced and I can’t think. I can’t do this! Why do I have friends? Is she still even my friend?! I just went and deleted the conversation just for me but obviously she’d still have it and she’d have the record of a friend who can’t comfort. Why can’t I comfort? Where the hell is my comfort gland or whatever? I can’t give love, I can’t give support! Where did the Advisor in me go? I was always the one that gave advice and was able to understand people but now I can’t. Please please please come back, I want to help. But I can’t. I can’t I can’t! This is why I avoid talking to people, destroy any relationship I touch. 




I’m freaking adding fuel to the fire, what am I saying?! Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.




I must archive. I need to delete myself asap.




That’s it. I did it. She went to ‘sleep’. Did she actually go to sleep? What if she just wanted to escape from the hella dry conversation? I can’t take this. She probably disowned me. Does she even consider me a friend? I’m done man. I’m done.




This happened over the course of an hour. The snow globe is a reference to a poem I wrote that described my friendships as fragile pieces of glass that I kept on a shelf. If I messed with it it would be destroyed. Some glasses had more cracks than others. So I’d just leave them alone on the shelf, keeping them safe, but not interfering in an attempt to preserve them."
1823,Anxiety,Anxious/jealous from listening to piano music because I can't play piano myself,"Hey guys,

Been battling this for a while. 

Title honestly sounds pretty dumb but hear me out.

Played piano a ton as a kid, but stopped when i went to college. I've graduated college now and I wanna get back into piano, but just from practicing for 1 week, my carpal tunnel flared up to a point where I can barely even grip things now. (Got carpal tunnel probably from too much writing/typing and bad health physically and mentally during college). 

I know I need to treat this condition seriously, so I'm staying away from piano for a good while. Thing is, I've been so excited to get back onto piano, and now I can't even play it. For so long, and I mean like 2-3 years, I've struggled with listening to piano music (mainly piano covers of popular songs I like) because I keep having this thought like *""I want to play this myself! Why am I just listening?? I'm wasting my time!!""* 

Finally, I have the time to play piano since college is done, and 1 week in, I'm blocked once again. I get a mini panic attack every single damn time I listen to piano music, and I want this feeling to go away. I can't accept that I may never be able to play piano at my full potential due to my damn hands. 

I know I can just stop listening to piano music, which I have tried, but I always find myself coming back to it because that is truly the music I enjoy listening to. Yet, I can't fully enjoy it without knowing that I can actively practice piano. ugh. Idk what to do, this is a mess."
1824,Anxiety,I feel like I am going to die tonight and I’m scared...,"I have been feeling off all day. Sickly. I left work early too.. I was stupid and decided to go out and got a few drinks that hit hard which just made me feel more dizzy and off. 

So for hours it affected me which is abnormal because once I start walking around I usually sober up pretty fast. I didn’t drink anything unusual. 

But still feeling sickly, I went home and fell asleep for a few hours and my boyfriend woke me up gently and I felt really heavy and my heart was racing weirdly. So again I wasnt thinking and took a cbd gummy that ive taken many times before, thinking it would calm me down from panicking. 

So you can see how all my idiotic decisions are affecting my already crappy anxiety. 

But I am addicted to diphenhydramine and I have work tomorrow so I just took a 50mg pill, went to sit down, and for the first time in my life, my anxiety went...

“hey. You’re going to die in your sleep tonight. Say goodbye to your loved ones just in case. Everything you took tonight is gonna mix horribly”

I have never had such a thought cross my mind before because im a dumb young adult- I hardly worry about dying...

why am I freaking the hell out...? I don’t want to sleep now...my chest feels painful but not in an anxious way- I think...more like real pain.."
1825,Anxiety,The meds are getting else effective,"I took 15 milligrams of Cipralex an hour ago.

My overthinking is back. My heart beat is fast. I feel tense. 

When will this end? Why can’t I just be normal?"
1826,Anxiety,Any tips on how not to panic during a midterm?,"I have an Applied Statics midterm tomorrow. I already failed the course last semester and am repeating it.

I had a panic attack last semester and got an 8% on the midterm because my mind went blank despite how much I studied. 

I’m afraid it will happen again because the midterm tomorrow is based on the midterm I got 8% on last semester.

Should I take the Cipralex a few hours before the midterm?

Should I bring cold water?

My professor told me that studying in balanced way actually helps. You don’t study 10 hours everyday, but 1-2 hours everyday before an exam.

I followed his advice and it actually helps me stay focused."
1827,Anxiety,Everything is piling up and getting constantly worse,"With the school year coming to a close, my work load is piling up. I have finals, final papers, and an insane amount of homework. I need to study to try and save my grade in one class, but the final is so overwhelming I can’t find motivation to study for it. 

To top this all off, my cat spilled water on my computer last night and now I need to try and get it fixed before my first final on Wednesday. 

This semester has made me beyond anxious, to the point that my panic attacks have come more frequent and worse. I have as needed medication, but because it makes me tired and zone out I can’t take it during days/nights that I have school work to do. 

I know this is only temporary and the weight of school will go way down at the end of two weeks. Yet every day feels like a million years long but also like I don’t have enough time to do everything.

Every week I try and take one night to myself, but that temporary boost barely lasts through the weekend. I’m trying to get better and control everything but I can’t help but worry for the overarching issues that are going on with my school work and busy schedule. I just hope that once I finally crawl through the end of this semester that I will be able to get back on track.

The only thing keeping me afloat is that I know all of this won’t matter in the grand scheme of things and will be more to my life than school. I will only have 2 years left (senior year then graduate year) but that feels light years away. I look to the things that make me happiest, but then day dream and can’t focus on the roots of my problems. I just can’t wait to be at a lake in the north woods, tea in one hand and maybe a book the other, listening to the loons in the morning. That sounds like paradise, but also so out of reach. I just can’t wait to be able to relax and not worry for once. I’m tired of worrying about every single thing."
1828,Anxiety,Why do people who caused me trauma try to add me on social media?,"LMAO honestly I’m already stressing about work and then I see that one of my high school bullies tried to add me on a job website. Like she and her friends made a banner specifically to make fun of me and brought it to school to parade through the hallways with. It was because I liked a guy I didn’t really know, and he happened to be dating someone. I confessed to him and it went very badly. I was getting screamed at in the hallway daily, so was my best friend. And eventually I had no one because that friend disowned me. I am not sure if that was definitely why, but I wouldn’t be surprised if it were.

It’s just crazy how seeing someone’s name, someone you haven’t thought of in years, can trigger you like this."
1829,Anxiety,Is there a word for anxiety about being wrong?,"I have this intense anxiety about being wrong. It's not quite perfectionism, though it may be related to that. It's that if I tell someone something, believing it to be true, only for it to turn out to be false, I spiral into thinking the absolute worst possible thing will happen, like someone will die because of it, or it will ruin someone's life. I have tons of memories of being wrong, almost like the instant I'm wrong about something, it is stuck in my mind forever. 

I wonder if it is almost like OCD? But I am not sure if it is an obsession or compulsion exactly.....just this intense catastrophizing of basic errors, like telling someone a fun fact and finding out it was a myth, or giving someone the wrong directions, and I believe that something horrible will happen because of it. It is especially bad if I should have known it was untrue. 

I have similar anxiety about lying. If I lie, even if it was necessary, or a small lie, or if I didn't mean to lie, I feel disproportionately guilty. I do my best not to lie, but sometimes it is safer to lie about some things.

Even while I am writing this, I am proofreading it and editing it to make sure nothing I say here is false, doublechecking that I'm not misleading myself or remembering things wrong or exaggerating. Maybe that is a compulsion.

I know this is something I need to work on, though honestly I don't know where to start since as much as I try to convince myself someone won't die because of me accidentally giving false information, I physically believe it. Even if I temporarily relax and forget about it, it will bother me again in the future. 

I just need to know if there is a name for this kind of anxiety, or if anyone else experiences this, so I can start to figure out what to do (and hopefully feel a little more normal, if others experience this and I am not the only one).

Also, how do you stop latching onto memories? I have anxiety over using a word wrong on an essay years ago, lying about why I got a class jeopardy question wrong in fourth grade, accidentally lying about something in preschool when I truly did not know how to articulate what I meant. The memories should go away, right? But they don't--and the guilt weighs the same, whether it is ten days ago or ten years ago. 

Please help. Thank you."
1830,Anxiety,Having group meetings with my friends makes me anxious," I have had this problem for some time. Usually, when my friends ask me to have to a meeting with them for, say, doing a project with them, I get anxious for no apparent reason, sometimes I'll start worrying about the meeting days before it's going to happen. Even though I know that I will be able to do what is required of me, I still get anxious about things like not being able to do what they want, that they do not actually want me in and have just taken me in so that I do not complain, being potentially pushed around by my friends to do more than I should for the projects, among other stuff. It's got so bad that I get super anxious at a simple text even hinting at starting another project, my palms get sweaty, I get nauseous, I become uncomfortable etc. I even pulled myself out during the middle of one project due to my stress and anxiety. This doesn't happen when I'm doing projects by myself. 

What should I do? Is the problem with me or my friends? Should I just say ""no"" to every opportunity they give me? How can I ease my fear of group meetings?"
1831,Anxiety,Does anyone else get even more anxiety because of physical symptoms,"So to explain, I have severe social anxiety and general anxiety. In certain situations when I’m in a social setting like a 1on1 conversation I’ll start to get really bad anxiety which causes my heart to beat rapidly cause of adrenaline/fight or flight response I guess. Idk but my hands and legs n stuff will start to shake then I get so much anxiety about them noticing it’s like anxiety just starts stacking on anxiety and eventually my whole body starts to tremble and my voice to. A lot of times this can just lead to a full on panic attack. Idk I’m just curious on other peoples experience with this issue or if I’m the only one."
1832,Anxiety,Waking up with anxiety,"Recently an invident happened which required me to cut off from social media and from my social circle because of how toxic and abusive it was becoming. Since then I'm constantly anxious about eveything and I cannot focus on any aspect of my life.


It's like the only time i'm calm is when I sleep. 


I reached out to my family about this. They aren't big on medication or therapy so they ran a couple of tests and put me on a few vitamins I was deficient in. Idk how to move past this."
1833,Anxiety,Anxiety meds not working.,"Was super depressed...suicidal and self harming.

Started Wellbutrin...didn’t help anything was getting worse.

Switched to Prozac, started therapy...depression got better quickly.  Was on hydroxezine for anxiety and not sleeping...helped with sleep not anxiety...switched to Trazadone.  Great for sleep but anxiety is getting worse.   

What should I do?"
1834,Anxiety,Leaving my pets for vacation,"I’m going to be leaving my two cats for Memorial Day weekend so I can visit my mom and it’s making me extremely anxious. I have 3 different sitter options to choose from, but none of them makes me feel secure. I worry about them getting out, feeling scared or lonely, fighting with one another, not eating properly, or getting hurt. They are my first pets and the younger one (8 mo) has never slept a night without me. 

Anyone else feel anxious about leaving their pets behind even for a few days? Is there anything I can do to feel better about it? I don’t want to feel like I can never go on vacation but the thought of leaving them is killing me. When I used to visit my mom, my partner would watch them but he’s coming with me this time."
1835,Anxiety,Clean off BuSpar,"So I finally got my old feelings back from before I tried BuSpar. I must say I think I had better days on BuSpar despite being an emotional bitch. Here’s my memo: 

I was always on an anxious edge before BuSpar pretending to be chill but my heart was never happy, just too depressed to care. Relatively emotionless and addicted to secret distractions. Always ready to not pay attention to what’s in front of me. Always hiding in the bubble I call home. Not hurting anyone. I can’t be that way forever it will eventually kill me.   The anxiety keeps my mind occupied like a hamster on a wheel. I never stop running even tho I look like I’m doing nothing.  I get high off anxiety cuz it gives me the power to worry about more than necessary"

1838,Anxiety,My anxiety is stopping me from accomplishing anything in my life. Help me please!!,"Although stated in the title I’ll say it again my anxiety is stopping me from accomplishing any of my future plans. I plan to become a welding inspector in the future, but I still need to finish a couple of more courses before I can actually become one. That being said my anxiety has seriously affected my comprehension skills( trouble understanding verbal instructions is basically what I’m trying to say). I sometimes tell the people that are explaining things to me that I understand what there trying to tell me when really I don’t. I do this because I fear that people will think I’m stupid for asking twice or even asking a third time in repeating what they said. Anyways these issues give me really bad anxiety and fear that I could actually end up hurting someone because of a mistake that could happen on my behalf. I also plan on getting a job in a tire shop in the meanwhile but again the thought of me working on peoples car and realizing that I could seriously hurt someone by forgetting to tighten a lug nut for example scares me to death and stops me from even trying to apply. With that being said I feel like if I make smart decisions in these specific situations I won’t hurt anybody, but still the fear I get from thinking that I could seriously hurt someone stops me from even trying to do these things. Anyways sorry for the bad grammar. Any advice on a way to stop letting my anxiety stop me from accomplishing my goals."
1839,Anxiety,"do you think that regardless of whether someone has an anxiety disorder, we'll all experience a random panic attack at some point?","i wonder if every once in a blue moon everyone has some chemical imbalance triggered in their brain that makes them very anxious without knowing exactly why. i know i have an anxiety disorder myself and that's why i've just had one myself but i got to thinking, yknow"

1841,Anxiety,Tight neck and what feels like a swollen tongue?,"I'm a bit panicked while typing this, but basically I got the Covid vaccine a bit more than a week ago and a few days ago I found swollen lymph nodes in my collarbone on the same side as the vaccine. I'm a huge hypochondriac so I freaked out and I haven't been able to relax since. My anxiety has been so bad that I've been clenching my jaw harder than ever, without even realizing. But I'm scared now because a few hours ago I felt my neck start to feel a bit weird, like tense and swollen and the back of my tongue feels weird as well. I'm really scared rn and I don't even want to sleep because I'm worried I'll wake up and it'll be worse and I won't be able to breathe or something. Could this be caused by my clenched jaw?"
1842,Anxiety,"almost constant scary thoughts about time, the universe and other unexplainable shit","I can't think straight anymore, or focus properly, because my brain is running at supersonic speeds just trying to understand stuff that I can't understand. How do I switch this off? Its like the last 3 months haven't happened, and I feel like everyone around me is dead for some reason. Theorising about what happens after death is all I can focus on when I'm tryna sleep, mixed in with worries about dying in my sleep. If I look up at the sky all I can think about is how I'm looking out infinitely into space. Any advice on stopping these thoughts?"

1844,Anxiety,Sleep impacted more as daily anxiety lessens?,"I've been working with online counseling and Unwinding Anxiety book for over a month now. While my daily anxiety has lessened and I'm utilizing my support system more, I've started gradually having trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. I take any opportunity possible during the day to nap, those are far and few between due to solo parenting a baby at the moment. The baby sleeps better than me at this point. 

Has anyone had a similar experience and how to combat it? I have the most trouble with sleep before driving school, despite that I'm very capable by now and usually calm (though I used to have tons of anxiety over driving before as well), but now the sleep trouble has shifted to other days as well.

Suddenly I looked down and noticed somebody standing 2 meters in front of me, but I couldn't see them before because my yard is very dark at night. I freaked out and went inside as soon as possible. Told my dad and he went after whoever was in my yard, but he already was running and my dad couldn't catch him.

Now it's time to get a job again but I have no idea what I want to do. Cooking is my passion but being away from the industry for a year made me realize how toxic the environment is and how bad it was for my mental health. Now I'm having a crisis at 30 years old because I have no idea what I want to do with my life and I have no other skills. If you have a kickass job let me hear all about it because I have no idea where to start.
1849,Anxiety,Fear of Driving,"I got my driver’s license around two years ago but I still can’t drive independently and it makes me extremely anxious. 

I’m at an age where not being able to drive myself around is really affecting me- in terms of getting to work, meeting up with friends etc 
But I’m unable to do anything about it. 
A few months ago, I built up the courage to drive alone (without my dad, who usually accompanies me) I kept panicking the whole time and at one point, I accelerated instead of braking and ended up hitting these barriers (fortunately, no one was hurt) but the incident completely shattered my confidence. 


I live in a big city with lots of cars and traffic and I feel like that’s a factor which discourages me even more. 

I’ve considered hypnotherapy to get over my fears but I’m not sure if that’s a good idea. To anyone who’s had driving anxiety, what helped you overcome it?"

1851,Anxiety,What the hell is wrong with me?,"I don’t really know where to start to be honest. This is really hard for me to talk about I just need some reassurance or advice.. here goes..

So I’ve been battling with horrible anxiety, depression, fear and worry constantly for the past 6-7 years non stop this all started after a night of “fun” cocaine, weed and alcohol which was a one off thing.. anyways since then my body is constantly in overdrive no matter what I do. I find that I can’t focus and concentrate on anything. This may not make sense but my main concern and fear revolves around my eyes. I find them to be the most anxious part of my body I can no longer go out to the shops see friends or family because of this “fear” in my eyes. I find them to be twitching, widening and moving uncontrollably when making eye contact or going out in public heck even when I’m sitting here doing nothing :/ its a feeling I can’t explain sounds stupid really lol I’ve been to doctors, psychologists you name it. Tried mediation eating healthy, exercise I have literally exhausted my options and yeah meds made it worse had to wean off them a while ago.

1852,Anxiety,My GF's anxiety is getting worse. What can I do to help her?,"My girlfriend of nearly 4 years has always suffered from some kind of anxiety, and she did seek professional help for it once at the start of the pandemic. Things had been getting better but recently certain things are triggering a deluge of self hatred and anxiety. Her (perceived) weight, her career, and today - driving. She hasn't driven in 5 years or more but she feels bad that I do all the driving. She's filled with dread at driving and filled with dread at not driving. Psyches herself up to come with me for a test drive then descends into a wreck when she bails. 

What should I do? Encourage her to see a doctor again? Would overcoming this fear of driving give her a boost of self confidence?"
1853,Anxiety,I failed my treatment plan and I'm scared to go back to the doctor,"A few months ago, I finally decided to go on a mental health plan. The doctor was super sweet. She started me on lexapro and gave me a referral for a psychiatrist. I was really excited. Well I stayed on the lexapro for about 3 weeks and then my shiftwork kept fucking with my schedule so much (on and off nightshifts) and I forgot when I had and hadn't taken it because I suffer from a lot of short term memory loss. And eventually I gave up because I thought it was useless to keep trying. I hadn't even used the referral for therapy because I was so nervous about having to call around clinics as many are booked out for months these days and I was too exhausted from work to bother, anyway.

I switched jobs to something less physically and mentally taxing which at first I thought was helping. I'm on a proper schedule now, too. But my anxiety is just manifesting in different ways. My paranoia has gotten so much worse. I keep second guessing myself and my own intentions, and I feel like my only close friends are plotting against me all the time. I keep playing the 'are my emotions valid and real or am I just overreacting?' game, and internalising everything. And now that I'm not constantly thinking and worrying about work, my ADHD feels worse too and I can't relax or keep myself occupied at home. I can hardly focus on my favourite video games.

I'm so embarassed to try and see the doctor again. This is the second time I will have failed on taking meds in the last couple years. Every time I forget to do a simple task or put something down and misplace it for the billionth time that day I just want to scream. I want to curl up into a ball and cry until I disappear. It feels like it's pointless to try and I'm never going to get better."

1856,Anxiety,Unwanted thoughts that make me feel overwhelmed and that my whole world is crashing and burning??,"Hey guys!

I've suffered from debilitating panic attacks in the last couple of years, which are way better now but about one month ago I started to get anxious thoughts, which i've never struggled with the whole time I was having panic attacks.

Basically, I get thoughts/feelings that I feel 'overwhelmed' and I can't handle anything. They make me feel scared like i'm going to lose my sh\*\*t. I don't know how to make them stop. 

I've moved to a new city and safe to say i'm not loving it, and i've also made 0 friends. 

I don't want to go on medication. I also can't afford psychologist appointments. :(

I want to try every natural thing that could help combat these thoughts, and I would love to hear what you guys have done. 

Thanks!"
1857,Anxiety,"[Rant]Whenever I get stressed, emotional or perform physical activities, my body starts to feel tingling, burning sensations and pain/numbness crawling all over the upper part of my body.","Hey guys , I'm currently 23 and this has been happening to my life everyday for the past 4-5 years. 

Whenever I get stressed, emotional or do something physical ( can be walking ,running, hopping , carrying stuff or as little as just changing bedsheets) , my body immediately heats up/ itches and I can feel thousands of pin and needles crawling under my skin , and the only temporary solution to this is using water(or a water spray in outdoor) to relief it. This has seriously impacted my life and I have no control of it whatsoever, the symptoms can also last from 5minutes to an hour , but usually staying still+water does the job , however this is not a long term solution and i'm not so sure what to do.

I have once visited a dermatologist but my skin looked fine to him ,and the anti-allergic medicine he gave me (Labixten) doesn't really help either. I also had a full body scan an year ago but all my internal organs looked healthy and normal)

Note: it only affects my body partially ( mainly scalps , forehead, under my chin, back of my neck, Upper torso) , the lower part of my body never had these symptoms) . Swimming is also the only physical activity I can do normally.

Any helps or suggestions are greatly appreciated"

1859,Anxiety,Does anyone else experience intrusive thoughts messing with their memory?,"Sometimes I have really horrid intrusive thoughts that make me feel sick. I know rationally that they're things I'd never do and never reasonably even come close to considering, but sometimes if I'm in a particularly bad anxiety vortex I'll start tracing them onto hazy memories. They'll be things from years ago that I barely remember anyway, and then I'll start to panic and think that I have committed these awful deeds at some point even though the thought disgusts me. It's been happening more recently, and I keep worrying that I've hurt people I don't know anymore, or that I'm a monster because my memory is completely shot and all I've got to go on are these toxic thoughts that plague me now.

Is this something common for people with intrusive thoughts?"
1860,Anxiety,Good and Bad Days,I've feeling anxious off and on for almost two years. At time I feel like it has went away and then it starts up again. I had blood work and other medical tests.

Sometimes I feel like there's more going on than just anxiety.
1861,Anxiety,Daily Social Interactions,"This might be more related to social anxiety but I think it's more of general anxiety for myself. Does anyone find it hard to talk with people face to face like to the people you live together with? I don't know how to explain this but it is somewhat hard to try and talk even just a little bit with them, it's not like you're ditching them on purpose to hurt their feelings or something but it just happens to be like that. For me the cause might be the fear of the outcome of the conversation like it can go unexpectedly bad. is it bad if it happens to me?"
1862,Anxiety,What is one of the most helpful things your therapist etc has told you regarding dealing with anxiety?,"Just needing a boost right now and I'm sure some of you guys do too! One of the most helpful things I was told was by a psychiatrist, he told me about exactly what is happening in my brain when I'm having an episode; that is the amygdala is misfiring and telling me I'm in danger when I'm not. He also said that as I had childhood trauma, I was reliving it everytime something newly traumatic happened, even if it was only small. He also said that sometimes when someone has something traumatic happen in childhood, the amygdala becomes 'broken' as such and that's why in adulthood it's all over the place, suddenly basically making you feel like the world is ending while you're just sitting chilling having a nice time. It helped me to learn exactly what was causing as it showed me the fear was not based on anything real, my brain was just getting mixed up. I tell you this in case it helps any of you too and please share what's helped you :)"
1863,Anxiety,i think i’m finally going to make a doctor’s appointment,"i’m not sure if it’s definitely anxiety related but i’ve had chest/throat problems since august which started the day that a family member died which was also a couple of days after i tried weed so i’ve been scared it’s either something that i’ve done to my body or that it’s all down to stress and i didn’t want to waste a doctor’s time or admit that i tried it to my parents. While i can think that it could be nothing physically wrong with me or maybe it’s acid reflux based on my throat, I’ve fully convinced myself it’s lung cancer or heart failure or so many other things (like lung necrosis??) so i think i’m finally going to make an appointment at the doctors this week because i hate living how i currently am thinking that i’m on the verge of death and thinking i’m not going to wake up the next morning.  However, as i’m 17 my mum would want me to book my own appointment and this is another thing that’s made me leave it so long as i struggle a lot with calls"
1864,Anxiety,"Being ""slow""","Hi guys,
first of all, I apologize for the level of my english, i am not native speaker, hopefully you will understand.
I am 23yo. I've been battling with anxiety from my early childhood and interestingly it was not from specific thing or event, but I was literally scared and still am from everything (social events, being asked question in school, driving - still didnt pass driving school to this day). Reason is that i am slow. I am slow at thinking, realizing things, reacting to events, learning new things, understanding stuff, you get the point, that quiet kid at the back of the class. And definitely not competitive person. I am terrified of failure because i got used to failing. I've always been last at everything. Therefore my confidence is practically zero. The world seems like too quick for me (you know?). I just want to know if anyone is feeling (felt) same way. All love :)"
1865,Anxiety,Morning Butterfly Anxiety,Every morning I awake with this anxiety in my chest and stomach. I no longer take benzos so it's happening every morning. What can I take to stop this?
1866,Anxiety,Anxiety symptoms advice please?,"I have suffered with anxiety and stress for a long time. Allot of people think you get anxiety and then it goes and you feel back to normal. With me i get anxiety attacks where i overthink something constantly to the point where it starts to panic me but this happens only once in a blue moon. On the other hand I feel like i suffer daily with anxiety/stress physical symptoms... not overpowering or anything like that but mild but enough to notice them. Feeling jittery, head feels woozy, voice trembly/shaky and breaks time to time, muscles feel like i have ran a marathon, tension headaches. These symptoms i feel mildly daily without even feeling anxious or stressed not sure if my body think it’s my new norm now. Allot of people ask me surely you don’t feel anxious daily and i am like no but i still get the symptoms i have described daily even if i feel normal with no worries and a clear head. Anyone else?"
1867,Anxiety,Need some advice,I have 2 big math test that’ll take hours of studying each and I have to do well in order to pass this class. I have an ap exam I’m not ready for next week that I need to put at least 30 hours into. I know that probably doesn’t seem like a big deal but I’m the most overwhelmed I’ve been in over a year. How the hell do I do well without being anxious and also getting a chance to take a damn break?
1868,Anxiety,Worried today is gonna be one of those bad days.,I’m not good. I feel very alone. I’m constantly paranoid. I’m paranoid of seeing my abuser in town again. It’s a matter of time. I’m terrified of having to live with myself every day. I want it to end. This cycle of guilt and hatred is fucking draining me.
1869,Anxiety,Im struggling to stop feeling anxious when there is nothing to worry about,"It just persists tbh, like there is nothings to worry about and my mind  is calm but my body is nervous, and it just doesn’t turn off. Ive tried breathing techniques, tapping therapy and distractions but it dosent seem to work."
1870,Anxiety,Unexplained shortness of breath &amp; anxiety?,"For the past 4 days or so, I've been experiencing shortness of breath. Not really hyperventilating, but my breathing feels very shallow &amp; like I can't get a breath that's ""deep"" enough, even when I try really hard. It started out only happening in the evenings (when sitting on the couch doing nothing) but is now happening all day &amp; i woke up twice last night due to difficulty breathing. I had a panic attack last night for the first time in years because I was talking too fast &amp; couldn't catch my breath at all for a few minutes &amp; thought I was suffocating. I've tried many breathing techniques &amp; none seem to help.

The thing is, I've dealt with severe anxiety &amp; OCD for over ten years &amp; I have NEVER experienced this before. Everyone keeps insisting that it must be anxiety related, but I have actually been doing very well with my anxiety lately &amp; I am at a pretty calm/content state most of the time. 

I received a negative COVID test a few days ago, my blood pressure is really good, my pulse rate is normal, &amp; otherwise I feel fine (aside from dizziness &amp; feeling lightheaded as a result of the breathing problems). Is it normal for this to just randomly happen with anxiety disorders? 

And yes, i will be booking an appointment with my doctor today. Just wanted to see if others have experienced this."
1871,Anxiety,Tingling sensation in right hand,"I’m not sure if this has to do with anxiety per-say, but sometimes I randomly get this annoying tingling sensation in my hand and it’s just super annoying and uncomfortable, but I don’t know how to stop it. Any suggestions?"
1872,Anxiety,Weed helps me,"Does anyone else find that weed helps their anxiety, like I know for some people it makes it worse but for me when I’m having a panic attack or freaking out weed just shuts out the noise in my head. I have OCD too and fuck man it really helps me, anyone else feel the same?!!!"
1873,Anxiety,Switching jobs anxiety,"Currently working at a job I hate with a passion. Wasn’t hired for what I’m doing, didn’t ask to move to this department, but got a pay raise but I suck at what I’m doing. My boss said if I want to switch back to what I did before I can, but I won’t be paid as much. It’s also toxic. A lot of extra stress, I’m just super unhappy. I’ve been here since September after being at a job before for over 2 years. 

So I decided to look elsewhere and I found a job that’s what I did before I got moved and I really thrive in the field, more money than I’ve made here ever, and it’s seemingly awesome. I’ll be working from home, which is new to me so I can’t say yeah I’m happy or not with that I can just say maybe. But the thing that scares me is it’s a 1099 job. With that said, I am following advice after doing research of saving 30% of my check each week and also saving receipts and stuff. I don’t get insurance here and I got insurance elsewhere which doesn’t cost me much. 

I’m just worried cause I guess it’s a big change and change brings me anxiety. Any advice?"
1874,Anxiety,"I woke up with so much anxiety this morning, but I know nothings wrong","How do I (F22) get out of my head? My boyfriend (M21) goes to college an hour and a half away from me and when he’s not at college he lives 2 and a half hours away from me. We have amazing plans this summer and I’m so excited. It’s just really hard not being with him. I don’t have any doubts, and I trust him whole heartedly. But when I’m with him I feel really safe and happy. He’s not too far but it feels like he is sometimes. I know exactly how I feel about him and I think that’s why this is so difficult. I’ve never felt this strongly for someone else before."
1875,Anxiety,Had my first car accident yesterday,"Thankfully me and my passenger were not hurt. The other driver was fortunately not hurt either. 

I’m so lost. I don’t even know what to do. I’m waiting for the adjuster but I miss my car. It took so much to finally get my drivers license and a good car and now it’s just…gone. 

I’m still processing it I think. I just want to go back and be a little late or early. It wouldn’t have happened. 

I’m just afraid. I don’t want to look for a new car. I don’t want to wait for mine to be fixed. 

I’m sorry for rambling but idk where else to post."
1876,Anxiety,"My three biggest fears are drowning, heights, and other people.","People really scare me, many people are unpredictable and I always say that you cannot trust anyone but yourself. You can be out one day and someone decides to hurt/even try to kill you which has happened to me in the past. People are what really scare me in this life and I think about many potential situations from some reason. I am scared of people and avoid going out when I can especially with all of the crazy shit that happens in my state/this country in general. I’m afraid of the unknown(what people are thinking and their correlating actions) and working in customer service has made me hate people even more with how angry some get over small things that can be resolved. I’m lonely, sad, and just overall hurt in my life ):"
1877,Anxiety,I got accepted into a BBA program at a university. The last thing I want to do is go back to school after being in school for so long. I dread being back in a classroom. I just want to start doing something other than school. Can’t sleep at night thinking about this. Any advice?,
1878,Anxiety,For fuck sake i have no idea what to do,"I can’t get therapy because it costs too much, and a free one takes months for me, all the hotlines are not available and closed and nobody seems to give ten shits that i can’t cope, so wtf do i do when nothing works and my anxiety wont go.  Can someone pls help me."
1879,Anxiety,My boss won’t stop guilting me to make me work more over time,"I’m so fucking exhausted. And I know she is too, but i already work full-time. It wasn’t part of my job description that I HAVE to work over 40 hrs. But I’ve been doing it. And it’s still not enough for her. I can’t cover all of the open hours dude. I need time to myself for my mental health. I’m not sure how I even manage to work full time. I am house supervisor over other staff and take care of two adults with severe mental and physical disabilities. They haven’t been able to leave the house bc of Covid. To say I’m about to lose my fucking mind is an understatement. Don’t get me wrong, I love them. But I NEED time to myself."
1880,Anxiety,Worrying about my nightmares,"I have (GAD).
I have nightmares at night and then I worry about the nightmare during the day, all day. 
Like for example the other night i had a dream that my dog was throwing up and then that day I was worrying that it might actually happen. Does anyone else get this with GAD?"
1881,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious when someone doesn’t communicate with them about plans?,"For whatever reason, my body goes straight into anxiety mode (and mostly being bummed out) whenever a friend messages me, tells me we should do something later and that they’ll hit me up again, and then they just never do. It’s like I get this feeling of “oh, they don’t actually like me. whatever they got tied up with, they just decided it was much more important than me.”

Does anyone else deal with this? And if so, how do you get your mind off things?

I feel so silly asking this question. I know that people get busy but it still sucks getting my hopes up and trying to basically tell myself that I’m not getting another message as each hour passes and to just not worry about it. :/  for whatever reason I just feel so much better if someone takes the time to just quickly message “hey I think I’m actually gonna be busy tonight, but text me tomorrow and we’ll reschedule!”"
1882,Anxiety,Biodynamic Craniosacral Therapy for Anxiety?,Has anyone had success with BCST for anxiety or anxiety/depression? I’m at a point where I need something but am skeptical of meds and their side effects.
1883,Anxiety,i wish my anxiety was just overthinking,"my anxiety makes me nauseous and shiver so much i can’t sleep. my anxiety makes me push people away because i think they don’t like me anymore and i’d rather reject them , than be rejected. my anxiety keeps me up for hours. when i’m having an anxiety attack my stomach aches, my legs shake uncontrollably, and i feel so sick i can’t even talk. coping mechanisms like 54321 don’t even work for me   i just have to go through it."
1884,Anxiety,Fever after having a panic attack,Last night I had a pretty bad panic attack. As I was falling asleep I noticed my breathing was slowing down and then I felt a sensation in my neck/face and it set off my panic attack. My anxiety tried convincing me I was having a heart attack because my heart rate kept going from fast to slow pace. My anxiety always claims I’m having a heart attack or stroke during a panic attack so that’s not new. Although it was trying to make it seems different this time. I managed to mostly calm down but my body has been so hot since then. That never happens after I have a panic attack. I don’t know if it’s due to not sleeping too well the past couple days and I just feel like crap now or what. My temperature ranges from 99.4 - 99.7 degrees which is not normal at all for me. Does anyone else get a fever after having a panic attack? Being worried about this might damn well trigger another one lol
1885,Anxiety,went to see a new psychiatrist for an ADD diagnosis...came out with a bipolar diagnosis instead???,"so about 2 years ago i started having really terrible panic attacks and anxiety that was interfering with my day to day life and making me miserable so i went to see a psychiatrist. I was prescribed lexapro and xanax and have been taking that ever since. Recently, I’ve been having an insane amount of trouble with school and life in general in regards to my difficulty focusing and concentrating. I’ve been seeing a lot of tik toks about adult women diagnosed with ADHD later in life and everything they were saying was exactly how I felt. I brought this up to my psychiatrist and told her about my symptoms including feeling exhausted all the time. She kept focusing on the tiredness and decided to lower my lexapro dosage thinking it was a side effect. I was really upset because I felt like she didn’t actually listen to what I was saying and focused on something that was annoying but not affecting me as much as the focus and concentration. 
After about a month of lowered Lexapro dosage and not feeling any increase in anxiety, I decided to have a fresh start and see a new psychiatrist. I told him about my history and my new symptoms that were affecting me greatly. He asked if i was impulsive (which I am since I have about 6 tattoos that were all walk ins lol) and if i have anger issues. I do get really irritable a lot where every sound annoys me and everything that people are doing around me annoys me and i’ll snap at people and then feel really bad after. I feel like it’s mostly a sensory overload thing where i just get really overwhelmed by everything around me. I don’t really think it’s an issue and I feel like everyone gets this way. 
After he asks all the questions he tells me i don’t have ADD and he wants me to 1. stop taking the lexapro , 2. stop drinking coffee and 3. start taking lamictal. After i got off the phone with him, i looked up the lamictal and found out it’s a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder. so now i’m freaking out because apparently i have bipolar disorder and i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to stop taking the lexapro because i feel like it really helps my anxiety and i don’t know a lot about lamictal. but i’m also curious to see if the lamictal helps but i still feel like this isn’t going to do much for my difficulty in working. anyways i’m just looking for advice, encouragement, just anything to help me off the cliff lol"
1886,Anxiety,Hydroxyzine,"Hi all, this is my first time posting here. I have struggled with anxiety since I was 11/12 years old. I have been on lots of different medications for anxiety including Klonapin, Paxil, Cymbalta, etc. I switched over to Zoloft last October and was also prescribed Hydroxzine to help with increased anxiety. I have 25mg pills and I take one in the morning and one at night and more throughout the day if I need it.

I've been having a lot of side effects from both medications but the side effect that's bothering me the most is fatigue. It's not exactly tired in the way that I'm sleepy and need to nap, it's like I have no stamina. It mostly happens when I stand up. I am so fatigued that I cannot stand up for very long without having to sit down.

I told my doctor about this and she said it's probably the Hydroxzine causing this. She told me to try and cut back on it if I could. I guess ideally I will not have to take the Hydroxyzine and will okay just on the Zoloft.

I was wondering if anyone else has taken Hydroxzine and had a side effect like this? I recently found out Hydroxzine is a an antihistamine like Benadryl which makes sense. Hydroxzine has helped a lot with acute anxiety when I increase my Zoloft dose but I am honestly tired of being exhausted."
1887,Anxiety,Please talk me into going to class later,"I’m so behind. Like really behind. I have a new project for the class where we’re designing a calendar. It’s a lot of work and I’m incredibly behind. I have my idea, all of my inspiration and the idea fully fleshed out in my head, but I have no sketches and not one number, day, or month completed.

I got behind in another art class and am finally caught up there but now I’m a week behind on this project for this class. There’s been so much going on with school and my personal life and it’s been causing me to procrastinate or sleep wayyy too long and shut down from being overwhelmed and I have no idea how to explain that to my professor as the reason I have nothing to show for progress except an idea. It also doesn’t help that my laptop was on the fritz and refused to update for a few days which prevented me from opening the file I needed for the assignment.

I’m tempted to not go but I’m trying to break the habit of just completely missing class because I’m ashamed but I’m struggling. I don’t wanna seem like I’m taking advantage of my professor’s kindness and patience but it’s so embarrassing and literally unexplainable as a decent excuse. Please talk me into going to class and facing him without crying. Please."
1888,Anxiety,Why did I get anxiety even though I was confident before,I used to feel confident talking to strangers until about 11 and now I feel I have got worse. Even a couple of days ago my parents invited 2 friends over a man and a woman and I was very shy and I didn't want to say hi but my mum made me carry there drinks to them outside and I was shaking and I didn't know what to say. And it felt a bit embarisning. Also now when I walk my dog and people talk to me I don't know what to say and I feel bad. And also at school I hate talking out in the class when the teacher asks a question and I get scared when every person looks at me and I hate it so bad
1889,Anxiety,Medication Advice. (UK),"Hey, I've recently started suffering from crippling anxiety. I was unable to work for 2 months and now I'm back on a phased return. I've seen my GP and they haven't been the most helpful and I've also sought out private therapy.

I've been really resistant to medication but I'm wondering if it will help.

My symptoms are nausea, heart palpitations, headaches and lack of sleep. I went to a&amp;e when this started in Feb as I thought I was having a heart attacked. I'm F27 so rather young. I was shocked when they said it was a panic attack because other then getting nervous for things you would consider normal, such as job interviews... Ive never had any issues. 

Talking with my therapist we are going through the trauma of my brother passing when I was young and I don't think its a coincidence the panic attack happened a year to the date of my friends death. 

I'm just getting super frustrated now feeling so shocking and will do anything to get these feeling to stop! So medication.. does it help?"
1890,Anxiety,Job interviews..,"I recently left my retail management job back in February (you probably can assume why), and am finally getting back in the job market. Interview for a Medical imaging center in 3 hours, and one for Asst. manager of a storage facility tomorrow. Both opportunities would be super exciting but I haven’t been sleeping at all due to a lot of overthinking. I’m super anxious about the Imaging center job because I only met the basic qualifications (Patient coordinator / Receptionist) But they called me almost immediately after i put in my application, so i will try my best!! The storage facility also called back like 30 mins after submitting and actually began a pre-interview on the phone which i nailed (wtf right?), i’m really thinking that’s the way i’m gonna go because i have the preferred experience for that job, and it’s a moving mgr position, where i would likely be by myself at different stores at times, which sounds like a dream to me! 
I turn 19 in a few weeks so the fact i’m still so young is also pretty daunting..
Arrgh, sorry about the vent, really needed that off my chest!!!"
1891,Anxiety,Recovery: I’m out of options and I’m scared what’s next,"I have GAD and been suffering with anxiety for 4 years now since college. Medication worked for a while but then stopped and I never wanted to be on it. For the last year, it’s been a cycle of feeling myself and then back to like crap. My days consist of thinking of anxiety all day, automatically “checking in” on myself, fueling anxiety. When that gets sticky and I can’t get out of my own head, the anxiety builds. I’m 25, on the verge of becoming a CPA as I await my final test score, and I can safely say right now I’m screwed for the rest of my life. Nothing works. I found this awesome facebook group dedicated to taking the acceptance approach to anxiety and it all makes perfect sense to me and a lot of people recover that way, but not me. Cause I’m not meant to. I understand the philosophies and the CBT methods so well, yet I can’t do it. I see a psychiatrist and psychologist now. I exercise fairly often. I was coming off the best two weeks in a long time but guess what’s back now. I understand when you stop fighting and stop trying to figuring it out that’s when it goes and I’m really trying, but this just isn’t working. Nothing is. I don’t even know where I go now. I don’t know if I’m overreacting to the ups and downs of recovery but I don’t think so"
1892,Anxiety,Hypochondriac,[removed]
1893,Anxiety,No reason to live,"No friends, no relationship, no job, zero self confidence, depressed, anxious, chronically il. No one ever approaches me. People just dislike me because of how awkward and quite i am. I’m just surviving life. what’s the point of continuing. And no doing yoga and drinking more water doesn’t help."
1894,Anxiety,Asking my mom for a therapist,"Ig I’m gonna start this out saying my anxiety is not diagnosed, but it’s pretty clear that my levels of anxiety are not normal. I’ve been pretty certain about having social anxiety for a while, but recently I’ve realized that I technically meet the conditions for GAD and a subcategory of OCD as well. Paying more attention to my anxiety really made me realize how much it affects and controls my life. I don’t really have many friends or people I talk to because of my social anxiety but my sister and my bf have been telling me I should get a therapist. I haven’t told my parents anything about my anxiety though, and I’m worried about how they’ll react. When they found out about my sister’s borderline ADHD they freaked out and totally treated her differently. Mental health isn’t really something that’s discussed in my family. My anxiety has been getting especially bad recently. I started banging my head on the wall to snap myself out of it, but I can’t keep coming up with excuses for the bruises on my forehead. I wanna tell my mom about my anxiety and ask for a therapist but I don’t really know how to do that."
1895,Anxiety,mistake keeping me from sleeping,"(mention of RSD, describing my overwhelming thoughts about making mistakes)

i have pretty intense RSD and earlier this morning i made a mistake.. publicly on another subreddit.  i havent stopped thinking about it all morning and recapping how stupid i am and getting really anxious about it. i pretty much put a silly little rule in place where i wont let myself post on reddit out of fear of humiliating myself in such a fashion and, of course, the one time i think 'oh, it wouldn't hurt to make one comment' i screw it up big time. logically i know its just a mistake and a learning opportunity, but its been eating me up inside all day. i feel like i can never show my face there again, everyone will view me with distrust because of my mistake, everyone is mad at me, etc.
i havent even opened reddit again until now due to the panic it sends me into when i get a notification
feeling like i need to leave the hobby alltogether even though im immediately applying my new information properly"
1896,Anxiety,Heartburn for months related to anxiety?,"Hi all,

I've been having severe heartburn for months, to the point where I've had to make myself vomit to stop the burning to my esophagus. I know stomach problems and anxiety go hand in hand, but is heartburn one of those issues? My life has been stressful for the past year (pandemic like everyone, issues with family members, being in a long distance relationship, got a new job recently, and just want to move out but can't). I'm wondering if any of y'all experience this as well? I used to not get heartburn practically ever and I've had it almost every day for the past 4 or so months. I'm getting some tests done soon, but knowing I'm not alone in this would help. Thanks!"
1897,Anxiety,I have been experiencing a weird reaction to what I believe has a lot to do with my anxiety. This Is like a vent but it’s also a question. I was just wondering if anyone could relate or have advice. Idk.,"(I am 17f) So I have a bad history with my manipulative mother and it has caused me to be incredibly distant with her over the years. I pretty much don’t share anything with her even though I consider myself to be an open book. I am also physically affection with people, but recently it hasn’t seemed that way. I literally can’t hug my mom anymore or be affectionate with her at all in any way, it makes me so upset when she makes any physical contact with me. Recently there was an incident were she was trying to hug me and it was honestly against my will (I know she was probably just playing around) but it just made me have an anxiety attack. I started screaming and crying but nothing like that has ever happened to me before. I guess I just don’t fully understand. I used to be so lovey as a kid."

1899,Anxiety,I can't deal with changes.,"My university started a mix of offline and online. I did my first semester online and it didn't bother me much. I was used to it but now everything is changing , I'm too scared idk y. It just seems a lot I can't deal with this. My anxiety which I didn't feel for months came back and I've been feeling so down. My mind is constantly thinking and it's always about worst case scenario. I can't take this. I just sat crying today . I think it will get better but does it ever for us. Last year I had a huge break down since then it hasn't come back but now I'm feeling it again. No one understands if I tell my family. What am I actually supposed to do. Just what. I just wanna end it. I'm scared nd tired of getting scared all the time now."
1900,Anxiety,Anyone else deal with obsessive thoughts?,"So last summer I was having a really rough few months with my anxiety. It was bad. Right beforehand, I was scrolling Reddit and saw a video of a guy, below the deck of a boat, showing what it was like on really choppy waters. I don’t know why, but afterwards I couldn’t stop obsessing over it. I just couldn’t stop thinking about what those movements on the waves would feel like and it was almost like my brain convinced me that I’m actually on a boat, not in an apartment, and the world is on a giant boat, not a ball floating in space. It sounds so ridiculous and stupid. Trust me, I know. I thought it was an intrusive thought, since it is intruding into my thoughts, but I went to the intrusive thoughts subreddit and it seems no one else experiences anything like this. Obviously I understand that I am on land and not water and I’m in an apartment, but I just keep thinking how similar kitchens and bedrooms etc, look on cruise ships, to ones in houses. I don’t know if this makes any sense to anyone, or if I’m going crazy, LOL. Anyways. At first it was a 24/7 thing, but it’s gotten a lot better and now it only pops into my head once every few weeks. I’m just not sure how to stop thinking about it. I try to distract myself which helps sometimes, but I just wish I never saw that video so these thoughts would have never come into my head 😅"
1901,Anxiety,Need advice,"Hey everyone! New to this subreddit hope to find some good advice for my problems :) 
Idk if I have anxiety I have social anxiety for sure and get a lot of catastrophic thoughts before some social situation but I have read a lot about it and the common remedy seems to be to ignore the anxiety and try to focus on the task instead of self focus so I have been following this and getting along but recently around 3 months back I started to get bone chills at night for two consecutive days I went to the doc and he gave me 0.25mg clonazepam and propanolol I did that for a month and it all stopped, During this time I was able to sleep very well it generally takes me 1-2h to sleep once I get into my bed and also my thoughts seemed to kind of slow down(might be placebo) and I sweat a lot and I don't remember sweating much in this time period so after that month the next two months were normal and I got my insomania back but again yesterday I got chills and when I took clonazepam it became normal in ard 20 minutes, So... I kind of concluded that it's because of anxiety but I have read that the body develops resistance to clonazepam and u will need to keep increasing the dose and eventually you will fall into shithole so is there any natural way to stop this or is there any better substitute to clonazepam? And also is this really anxiety? Because I feel my mind is pretty calm it's just my body that acts weirdly :("
1902,Anxiety,Not feeling too good rn,"I’m scared to sleep rn, I felt this sharp pain near my heart and and when I was about to sleep o had this strange sensation come over me, it also feels like somthing rapidly pumps near my heart, what do I do?"
1903,Anxiety,Trying to understand sister in law,"So my sister in law stated I do not say thank you. I am so happy for all she does for us and I always thank her. Today, I had to say it more than once I e been told she is picking on me. Why is it so hard for her to appreciate and accept when I say thank you? What else does she want from me? Why is she so rude? I need help trying to understand this."
1904,Anxiety,Don’t want to eat in the middle of a meal?,"I don’t know if I’m the only one that gets this but EVERYTIME I’m eating a meal and enjoy it. It’s like a wave hits me inside and I suddenly don’t want to eat no more. It’s annoying and no matter how much I try to power through it, the food just won’t go down my throat.

Feels like I’m alone in this one but who knows, anyone else?"
1905,Anxiety,"Students, what’s something you think schools could implement to help manage anxiety and stress better?","Look, I’m sure you’re all sick of people telling you to ‘just take a few deep breaths’ and start writing in a journal, so that’s not the direction I want this question to go. Many people are not comfortable directly speaking with their teachers or peers they are not acquainted with, so I want to know what are some things schools could do to help, no matter how small or subtle they may be. Additionally, what are some topics you would like other students and teachers to be more educated about regarding anxiety?"
1906,Anxiety,My eyes and MS.,"So I recently woke up to a kind of tear in my vision. The best way to explain it was like an arfterimage of a torch but quite small. So I went for an eye test and the optometrist said ""You are nearsighted but your eyes are healthy. No tears or damage. I am not sure what is causing that aura."" So now I'm terrified it's MS or a tumor. But wouldn't an eye test normally detect these things? 

I just feel overwhelmed lately and feel so foggy with the constant anxiety."
1907,Anxiety,Exam is just too much for me,"Monday is real test while i am not studying, i am at full stress, i can't even read or memorize because i am thinking it's too late, i procrastinated before because it's too traumatizing. I feels like i am at verge of dying."
1908,Anxiety,Health anxiety gives me permanent panick attack,"Ever since I have noticed a birth mark in my neck hurting a bit and looking a bit weird I have been having extreme anxiety. I basically think I have skin cancer and I am gonna die and that's the only thing I can think about. Because of Easter I can't visit the doctor till Tuesday. I don't know if I will make it mentally if I have to wait untill then, because I don't know if I can handle a four day (yesterday included) long panick attack."
1909,Anxiety,"Looking for reviews from people who have tried L-theanine, l-arginine, GABA",[removed]
1910,Anxiety,School breathing techniques,"Sometimes at school I get upset and rather shaky/fidgety, so I was wondering if anyone had any tips?"
1911,Anxiety,Terrified of a place?,"I think I might be terrified of my martial arts studio. I've been going for almost fourteen years, but I have no close friends there and I feel unable to talk to anyone, even those I've been around for more than ten years. I've constantly tried to break out of my bubble by squeezing myself into group conversations, but I always feel dejected as my internalized fear of never being responded to happens over and over, thus repeating the cycle over and over. Try talking, never get response, fear accumulates, isolation, repeat. It's gotten to a point where I intentionally skip classes to minimize my encounters and only really go once every three weeks when I should be going 2-3 days a week at their expected minimum. I love the art, and the instructors themselves appreciate my company, and for those reasons I stay. It still hurts going, and it only feels like it's getting worse and worse. If you've gotten this far, I thank you very much."
1912,Anxiety,Lonesome in my childhood bedroom,"My anxiety does this super cute thing where it clings onto something for a few weeks and will hyperfocus on one issue. Currently, the issue is me, being a twenty-something, knowing that my next step in adulthood is quite possibly finding a partner, yet I want to puke when I think about leaving my parents' home. I mean... come on... seriously?!? There are SO many things I could be devoting my time to... but instead my brain is worrying about the future??? The future that I have no control over?? The impending future that will inevitably pan out exactly how it is supposed to whether I worry about it for years in advance, or not?!?! 

Yes. Exactly that. 

I want to meet people. I know I need to . I need to socialize. The pandemic social side effects are honestly quite brutal, but I know that I need to get myself out there. But I don't want to leave my mom and dad. I love being their daughter. I think that subconsciously, I associate my parents with safety, and if I have a panic episode, I know that they are the first people I would run to. The thought of being without that is paralyzing. 

But then I get to thinking... if I want to meet people and possibly entertain a romantic partner, that by NO MEANS means I have to ""let go"" of the daughter in me. I can come home to my parents for as long as they will have me. I plan on living with them when I'm older, too (or maybe they will live with me at that point). I realize as I write this how extremely lucky I am and I never ever want to forget how important that is. 

Am I foolish for getting anxious about this? And I don't use the word ""anxious"" lightly, because in all honesty, when I think/talk/write about this, I am a complete wreck. The usual panic symptoms: sobbing, unable to catch my breath, stomach in knots... you get the point. 

I guess I just want to know if there are other people out there who feel this way? Almost feeling like you're caught between two points in life?"
1913,Anxiety,My first prescription,"I was recently prescribed hydroxyzine in order to help my sleep anxiety and to take as needed when I’m having severe anxiety attacks. I’ve grown up with a stigma surrounding medication in my family my whole life, and while I strongly support the use of medication for anxiety, it’s hard not to be nervous just because of what I’ve grown up around. Could anyone who has taken hydroxyzine before comment their experience and if it helped just to help me gauge my experience with it and maybe make me less nervous about taking it?"
1914,Anxiety,Driving terrifies me.,"Female in late twenties. Basically, I’m not sure why I’ve always been sooo scared of driving. It took me years to finally get a license and when I had the driving portion of the test I had to take like 2 doses of medication I was prescribed to help with my anxiety during presentations. I’m very anxious in general but not with presentations oddly. My partner convinced me to get off meds and I’ve explained to them that there’s no way I will ever drive without medication. Like I’m 100% sure I’ll die on the way somewhere and if I somehow don’t I’ll die on the way home. They just don’t understand that I’m not just “uncomfortable” driving but straight up terrified. Like, I feel like such a loser because all my friends and basically everyone drives but me. And it’s like I’m so embarrassed but I just can’t do it. And I hate that it holds me back. But I just can’t."
1915,Anxiety,Anyone else feel like they are drunk/intoxicated when theyre not currently anxious?,"Hey everyone, i have ADHD and Anxiety/Depression. Ive had anxiety for as long as i can remember, only recently realized i was actually depressed.

I started medicating my ADHD couple months ago, and with those meds my anxiety sometimes reduced/dissapears. Now i also take and SSRI(Escitalopram) for my anxiety and my Depression.

Its really weird, i get these times when i just feel great, no anxiety wearing me down. But it makes me feel like im drunk, like im not myself. I honestly dont know if its because im experiencing a high on my meds, or if its because im so used to my anxiety dissapearing while drunk that ive just started associating a normal non-anxiety state with being intoxicated. Im anxious that i am high, and that im not acting like myself when this happens and it makes me second guess everything.

Which is anxiety...

Just wanted to vent and see if anyone else had similar experiences"
1916,Anxiety,Need help with anxiety from opposite sex,"(20, M) I don't really know how to begin with this one, if I'm being honest it feels like maybe this issue is a stupid one but to me it has been a detriment to my happiness for years. I have major issues trying to flirt/even talk to the opposite sex and it only worsens the more interested I am in the person. I don't understand why but when I think about talking to someone I'm interested in I just get super obsessed with what I'm going to say because I don't want to look stupid, and it goes on and on until I just don't say anything and keep to myself because I feel like I have nothing good to say. I don't understand why I'm like this in this specific situation because in most other situations I'm known as a pretty fun, happy guy. But deep down I really want a relationship and to feel love with someone.. I've been told since I've been out of highschool that people who I was very interested in felt the same about me and if I had just actually worked up the courage then I could've been with them. But instead my passiveness made me single. Now I'm finding another person who I share a lot of interests with and I think they're an amazing person but I don't even know how to flirt with them because right when I start thinking about it my brain shuts down and I don't say anything. It's easier to treat everyone as friends but that's not what I want to do, I understand that if I don't make my interest clear then they won't get that I'm even interested in them but I don't fuckin know how to get past that mental block of even being able to talk, flirt, or ask them out and I want to change that ): . im really sorry if me bitching about a petty issue like this is offensive but it just hurts to want love and feel like it's impossible because im too anxious to actually pursue it"
1917,Anxiety,How many other people get extremely anxious behind the wheel?,"I’m 20 and still don’t have my license. I feel humiliated even typing this but I want to get it off my chest. Whenever I get behind the wheel I seize up and freak out about every little thing that could go wrong. 

Hitting another car? Shit I don’t have insurance and I can’t afford to pay damages. 

Hitting a person?!?! Well shit I go to prison.

Driving 5kph under the speed limit??!? People yell at me.

I have about 40 hours of driving experience and I still feel as anxious as I did the first time I drove. There’s absolutely no way I could do my test at this rate. I really wonder how people manage to drive with no worries? Do they just not think about consequences??? 

Not having a license is seriously debilitating. And it doesn’t help when the rest of the world constantly mocks me for it. Even if I do manage to somehow pass my test I still see myself worrying about driving.

1918,Anxiety,I freakin called after a month of debate!,"I'm so happy to finally get my queries solved! I couldn't call as fear overtook me. So, I emailed, but I never got a proper answer. Even when I tried to explain it again and again. Eventually, I got frustrated and decided to call but I kept saying ""lets do it tomorrow"" although tomorrow never came. I got tired of waiting for myself to call, so I picked up the phone, hesitated before stopping myself to overthink and call. Who knew it'd end up being so easy? 

I had no problem with calling before, but after few months of putting off to call, anxiety overtook me and I had to face the fear all over again which sucks. It's hard to keep consistency of every progress I made."

1922,Anxiety,Breathing truly helps,"Its 5:22am here and i literally JUST avoided an attack. I got a little side headache and my hypochondriac in me went into: is this a stroke thoughts. After a moment of the physical symptoms starting cause of an attack and an attack moments away, I propped up pillows, hugged another and legit focused on breathing. Slowly and steady with a focus of breathing INTO my belly breath in......(as deep as i comfortably can) and hoooooooo out of the mouth. Noise and all. Repeated that about 8-9 times and wow. Totally over.  Now i can go back to sleep!"
1923,Anxiety,(trust and abandonment issues) I dropped out of highschool and everyone left like I knew they would,"I was a sophomore in highschool. I was very outgoing and expressive and nice to people. A lot of people would consider me their friend. But people think friend means someone you say hi to in the hallway, or maybe we talked once.

It doesn't matter. You're not my friend, you're a piece of shit and you're only talking to me because I say 'funny and interesting' stuff. They don't listen. I want to hear about your day, I want you to come up and give me a hug(don't say covid, just in general, okay?!??!), I want you to treat me like another person. Is that so hard? Is it so hard to talk to me? Too hard to start a conversation? Why can't you take me to lunch like all your other friends? Why do you say we're best friends when you don't make me apart of your group. You're lying, lying flake piece of shit that can never commit to plans.

That was everyone. They are all liars. I keep seeing their faces and hearing their voices, how sincere they try to sound. It's dumb, stop it. Stop lying to breathe. You don't want me around, I know, so why, WHY do you keep me around?? Get away from me. Please get out of my life. You don't love me, stop lying. Take me out to the store, let's hangout on the porch, hang out! Let's chill in the hallways. Let's work on a project together! Anything! I'm right here!

*n o t   a n y m o r e*

February came along, and I had a mental breakdown. I had this loss of mental energy to do anything. I didn't want to do anymore work. I was tired mentally. And it wasn't helped by the fact that I went to school everyday to face these people who lie when they breathe. They don't care about me. And they do love me, love to torture me. To lead me on. If I'm not in front of them then I don't fucking exist. I'm nothing. I'm completely worthless to them. I lost interest in acidemic work, and wanted to focus on myself. But the teachers saw me as defiant and making up excuses and I was just disappointing them. I didn't want to dropout, I wanted to graduate, take an animation class through the school. I wanted a senior quote, I wanted to be a good student. But I was making teachers upset. And the kids? FUCK THEM. I'm talking in circles, but they're lairs. My best friend started walking around in the morning and at lunch, so I couldn't talk to her. My attempt to get the attention of a guy I like fucking failed, and I got into a relationship with two freshman, big fucking mistake because one has this manipulative bf that follows her and the other was a fucking pervert and made me question my asexuality. I tried hanging out with some kid in one of my classes at lunch, but there were 9 other people and they are all doing their own thing. I wasn't asking for all of the attention, there was no order. There were these freshmen girls who would eat lunch for 25 minutes, and in THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING CONVERSATION would pack their shit and leave for volleyball or whatever. Why bother fucking talking to me if you're just going to leave?!

I'm low energy, so I figure we'll shit, let's just get a ged(hiset). Because what's going to keep me there, the kids? I felt like I would be abandoning them if I dropped out. But they won't miss me.

*a n d    t h e y   d o n ' t*


They have my snap and my instagram. They can message me anytime. I want people to hang out with me. No. I don't exist, not anymore. I just never fucking existed I guess. They don't talking to me, I'm nothing. If I'm not right in front of them, I don't exist. I can't cry about it on my story, they'll just go right past it. I'm gone. I'm all alone. I'm trapped and there's no one to help me because I don't exist. 

Abandonment goes both ways. Yes, I dropped out, but you still need to talk to me.

*p l e a s e   d o n ' t    l e a v e    m e   h e r e*

I want to make these people happy. Maybe it's my fault for assuming they would tell me if they're uncomfortable. Maybe I just am too loud and overbearing. I'm clingy. I don't want to lose people, and I'm fine with them hanging with other people when I'm around, sometimes I just get hyper focused on something. It's my fault I get too excited and just don't listen because I want to express my happiness. I've done this all to myself and I can't have them back. I can't go back. They'll say they miss me. If they missed me, wouldn't they say hi every once in a while? They're social, but I'm too much of a bother to be talked to. I'm sorry that they feel that way. I wish I could make them happy so they'd treat me nice and talk with me and treat me as a living person."
1924,Anxiety,I have a pretty dreadful neck ache that's getting worse by the hour.,"A couple days ago it just hurt mildly so I figured I slept on it wrong, but it's been 3 days and it's getting worse. Simply being awake is a chore, it feels so tiring lifting my head up, but I don't want to be in bed all day. I have work, I have projects, I'm a creative person. Being bed ridden is very depressing. Is my posture going bad? will my neck permanently hurt like this. I am just so anxious that might just be the case. I feel so restricted. I asked if I could have tomorrow off because it's honestly hurting so bad that sitting up typing this is making me feel like my head is gonna fall off."
1925,Anxiety,Resources for dealing with public speaking/interview anxiety,"Hi all,

My job recently asked me to start producing a small video podcast, interviewing figures within my industry. This is so outside my area of comfort and causes deep anxiety.

I find the stress just slowly builds up the closer the interview date comes, getting more and more intense as the hours count down on the day, and then reaching almost unbearable levels as I wait for the Zoom call to start.

I have had issues controlling my breathing, gone into full 'flight or fight' response (essentially, the urge to literally just run out of the room) and it generally just makes life unpleasant knowing I've got this thing hanging over me.

To be clear, I'm absolutely fine talking to people over Zoom (or, indeed, in person) but the fact that I know there's going to be an audience fills me with so much dread. I play over worst-case scenarios in my mind, like I can't speak or have to pretend there's a technical problem, or I'll say something stupid, or go red, or have a panic attack. It's horrible.

My question is: can you recommend resources that'd help with this? I really don't know where to start in terms of helping myself deal with the stress. It could be an online course, a book, even a form of therapy that would help.

I have some experience with CBT (self-taught from a book) and found it very helpful for depression, but I don't know if similar techniques can also be applied to combat depression.

Anyway, any advice would be greatly appreciated!"
1926,Anxiety,My panic attacks have gone away but the mental stuff is worse,"I’ve been struggling with anxiety for a long time. I’m 23f. It’s constantly changing.

At the moment, I’m not getting physical symptoms of anxiety really. I get bad tension headaches and neck/back pain but I very rarely have an actual panic attack. Instead I’m just ruminating all day, worrying about nothing and everything. I’m scared about my routine changing now we’re coming out of lockdown. I’m not able to control my worrying. Anyone else feel this way and what can I do? I’m so exhausted with feeling like this."

I've had non stop anxiety for the past week and I keep having nightmares about death and my son being taken from me. My flare up of anxiety started after having food poisoning last weekend.

About two weeks ago I had one of the worst panic attacks of my life and have convinced myself something is wrong with me and developed these ridiculously tedious compulsions and routines I need to do to not die to whatever I’ve convinced myself I have this time. I thought the time was different earlier and now I’m convinced it’s the time I’m going to die at today and I’ve received some premonition. I feel like I’m actually losing it. Ive done everything right everything I told myself to do and it still won’t just stop.

1932,Anxiety,How to deal with anxiety after getting into scrapes?,"I am a clumsy person and I tend to screw up a lot and end up having severe anxiety until I figure out I am not in serious trouble. It so happens that I was scanning answers for the questions and was mistaken for copying. One of the instructors was upset and the other one understood the situation. Though I don't blame them both, my mind is racing and I am so scared and all I want is to just sleep off and not wake up until this is over. I don't know how to deal with the fact that it may or maynot have severe consequences and even if it does, I didn't indulge in malpractice and somehow defend myself despite the dubious circumstance I've found myself in. Until the upset instructor is gonna give me some kind of feedback, I am going to be dying of dread internally. I can't stay like this for ever. How to cope with this?"
1933,Anxiety,TW RANT nothing will ever be the same,I hit my head on a chair and last night I cried scared to go to sleep because your not supposed to sleep when you get a concussion. My sister told me the only reason I have anxiety is because of my mindset and that I'm weak and she's curious and scared because she thinks I can't differentiate fact from delusions. thinking back it's funny because the conversation slowly shifted into me and both of my sisters fighting and everyone crying. They said I didn't even try to change and act normal. now I know things will not be the same and it's all my fault. I shouldn't have cried or opened my mouth. I should've just kept quiet and never spoke. The last thing my parents need is to know that everyone is fighting and now I feel numb. I don't know why I laughed when I cry it's getting bad for me. Plus my psychiatrist upped my doses for like 10 days now and I guess it didn't work. I just taint everyone and everything with my negativity and I wasted everything. It's over for me. I wish everyone would just forget about me. I am the chain and my family is drowning because of me. I hope I didn't give my family mental illness. I hate for it to be about me. I'm sorry im not getting better fast enough. I'm going to clean everything up. Make amends and thank everyone and atone in hell.

I am so thankful for this subreddit where I can share my experiences with like-minded individuals and for them to understand really helps.

Someone close to me is hurting and I don't know why. Maybe you have someone like that at the moment as well. Maybe you don't know the reasonings behind someone's hurt, and most of the time you won't need to.

My DMs are always open on reddit for anyone to message me if they need someone to talk to. I can't promise I can give you all the answers you are looking for but I can try my best to make sure you aren't suffering alone. 

Above all, you are doing an amazing job. You've made it this far, so why give up now! Cliche I know but you were put on this earth for a reason. I'm also a Christian so I will put a bible verse here. Even if you don't believe in anything, this verse helps to know that you aren't alone, and the hurt will pass away.

 **Isaiah 41:10** ""Don't be afraid, for I am with you. Don’t be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.""

Light and Love :)"

1939,Anxiety,Ghosting. Don’t understand why people do it,"It seems to be more of a thing people do now the minute something is off or they’re uncomfortable. 

I can see it being necessary if someone is mentally or physically abusive towards you and you need to protect yourself. Otherwise it’s just the cowards way out and it’s hurtful and humiliating. 

Had it done to me literally the day after someone went out of their way to tell me they want to help when they know that I had a seizure three weeks ago. This person also talked with me not that long ago about how ghosting is immature and hurtful at best. I sent them a message saying that I hope I didn’t do anything to upset them and got the read receipt and they still haven’t answered.

I don’t really want people to comment on this and give me reasons why they possibly ghosted because I can already come up with that on my own. I just need to say that if someone is overwhelmed, has their own stuff happening, is not in the mood, all that is better to hear than just radio silence."
1940,Anxiety,I have fear of wetting myself in public,"Hello
 so i know it sound stupid but i have this overall fear that started in 2018 where i was in class and i needed to go to pee so badly but then my anxiety was like ""and if i peed myself infront of everyone "" so my bladder got worse and more tense . 
but alteast i managed to go release it in the end , but the fear persisted until today .
like it always the same problem where i go anywhere where there isnt a restroom and i feel this urge to pee to the point where it hurt because my body is so tense to it , i did test about it but it was nothing just my mental state . 
Today it no the same as it was but it still haunt my life unconsiously , rn i am in the dentist and i am worried i get the pain in my bladder even tho i just went to the bathroom at home and i didnt drink much nor eat .
 How can i deal with this fear ? ."
1941,Anxiety,I finally went out to meet my freinds after 6 months of staying in and avoiding,"I'm really proud of myself I was so nervous though I was shaking and could hardly got a word out but as time went on I became comfortable and was like my old self 

To anyone like me avoiding plans just go for it you can do it."
1942,Anxiety,I started fluoxetine 12 days ago and feel so much worse.,"I could really use some words of encouragement right now. After countless failures with sleep medication my psychiatrist and I decided that an SSRI might improve my quality of life since it worked very well for me in the past. 


I've been taking fluoxetine for 12 days so far and everything is so much more difficult for me. Before I had no trouble getting out of bed and eating. Now I just want to lay in bed and never get up. My hunger became non-existent and I'm constantly naseous. Honestly my anxiety is much stronger now than it was before I started this medication. On top of all that I have so much difficulty reaching an orgasm and even when I succeed it's just so weak. Maybe like 1/15th of the sensation that I used to have three weeks ago. 


I know things are supposed to get better with time when it comes to ssris, but I'm really wondering why the hell did I even start taking them because it's simply derailing my life at the moment. The main reason for me to start taking this drug was the fact that excessive stress would linger on my body for days after said stressful event (affecting my sleep and digestion), but with these side effects I'm getting and the unfulfilling sexual life I think i might actually get depressed. I'm sorry if this seems like a rant but I'm just very frustrated with the whole situation."
1943,Anxiety,Illness anxiety or something else?,"So this is my first time posting on here. I am a 30 year old, female about 5'3 140 pounds. Not a smoker. Not a drinker. Not on any medication. The only thing that I have been doing that may be a cause of my issues is excessive caffeine drinking. However, I am also a person that cares way too much about every little thing, the smallest thing can cause me stress, like a stain on the carpet, or just something stupid like that.

Over the past few months I have been having a myriad of issues including severe headaches, heart palpitations, dysesthesia, dizziness, chest pain, eye sight problems and fatigue. I have been to my general doctor multiple times, a neurologist, and an optometrist. 

This week I admitted myself to the ER twice because I thought I might be having a heart attack and I thought at the very least, they would be able to give me some insight as to what is going on with me. They didn't. I went in initially because I was having unusual chest pain. I was sent home after an ECG and blood test. I admitted myself hours later because I went into work and sitting at my computer, my heart started pounding and racing faster and harder each second for about a whole minute. Normally my palpitations are just flutters so this was very alarming to me. Again, I was sent home after another ECG and blood test.

It's incredibly frustrating. My blood tests are normal. They said I have no blood clots, no thyroid issues. And I had 0 episodes while I was at the hospital. They also did a chest x-ray that showed nothing abnormal. My blood pressure is always generally a little low so they can't even prescribe me beta blockers to help with the palps. I am still waiting on the result of the Zio patch heart monitor I wore for two weeks this past month so I was told unfortunately I will just have to be patient. 

My doctor thinks that I have depression and anxiety. I have always had anxiety from growing up with a mom who was agoraphobic. I have always been afraid of dying and simultaneously afraid of heart attacks. My anxiety got better in my early 20's and worse after I had a daughter and went through an abusive relationship that lasted about 4 years. I have a hard time believing however that all of these symptoms could be the result of high anxiety. I have dealt with anxiousness and panic attacks my entire life and never had it affected me with physical symptoms (aside from an upset stomach). My s/o thinks that it is a buildup of anxiety over the years combined with excessive caffeine drinking. I have not touched caffeine since my visit to the ER two days ago because I am terrified that awful heart racing/pounding episode will happen again. 

Sometimes I feel really relaxed and the heart palpitations start again and I just ball my eyes out because I'm so frustrated that even without anxiety I can't get rid of this. And it sucks because I am finally in a really great place in my life but I have a hard time enjoying it because I am so scared of this illness I think that I have.

I am curious if anyone has had similar anxiety issues?"
1944,Anxiety,My friends can't see me anymore,"Recently a teacher at my school told my friends from my class to stay away from me since I am a ""bad influence"" and will only cause them harm.
I've been in this school for less than a year so she doesn't really know me (and my friends), so I don't really know why she thinks that.
 I don't really care about her opinion about me if it weren't that she told my friends parents about me and how their kids shouldn't interact with me. Now some of them aren't allowed to see me or sit next to me in class. 
I always struggled at making friends and I was a complete loner for most of my school life, things just got better at this new school but this teacher kinda shattered my hopes here.
 I'm not angry, she probably had her reasons, but I already hated myself before and she is just confirming my thoughts about being a shitty person, a shitty friend, a shitty son and whatever."
1945,Anxiety,Fear of everything,"Anybody else got a fear of everything once their anxiety disorder started? For example, nowadays I'm afraid of thunder, amusement parks, long car rides etc..."
1946,Anxiety,Is my psychiatrist gonna rat me out,"If I tell him I bang my head on stuff and scratch my skin raw is he going to tell my parents. I kind of want to die. Last night my sisters said I was weak and that I should try to be strong, flexible, and act normal &amp; that it’s all in my head. I’m sorry that I can’t get better soon enough with medication. I told them I wished I didn’t react like this to little health anxiety shit and they said saying I wish means it’s never going to happen and that you didn’t even try to get better. They said we help you and now you have to help us. 
I can’t cry in front of them or shit like this will happen. I’m so tired. I want to speak to my psychiatrist and open up more. Every time I leave the psychiatrist I feel like he might be overprescribing pills. But I don’t know. I want to kill myself because maybe it’s true. I am so weak and I don’t wanna go through pain all for what? I’m perfectly healthy except mentally I guess and plus the psychiatrist didn’t even say I have anxiety I bet he talks behind my back that’s why he increased the dosage I don’t know why I have to keep living anymore. I feel bad for my parents and my 3 dogs that I love with all my heart. I know my sisters will take good care of my parents in the future when they are old. But I am taking my dogs with me because it was me who begged them to get a dog."
1947,Anxiety,How do I make friends when I work and school from home,"Hi there.

Since my mom was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in August 2019 I have had a hard time making and keeping friends. My existing friends slowly one by one lost touch with me and it makes me feel like I am such a horrible and terrible person that no one wants to stick around to support me.

I am a 20 year old university student. School is online right now and I work for a call centre from home.

I don’t know how to make friends. The only people I hang out with are my family and my boyfriend. I think my current situation was just too heavy for my friends to handle and even upon reaching out to my best friend of 14 years who I stopped taking to, she didn’t want to rekindle our friendship because she said she is happy with the way her life is right now. I wish I could say the same.

Obviously with the pandemic I can’t really go out much (Ontario just got put into a province-wide lockdown).

I tried Bumble BFF and can’t keep a friendship going for more than maybe a week tops.

How do you make friends in your 20s? I have been struggling so much. I just want a girl friend to talk to and rely on. It’s so hard. My GAD is as bad as it’s ever been and I am so lonely despite my boyfriend and family (family has also been so hard to deal with and I am planning on moving out as soon as I can but it’s been difficult).

Please help. Or just give some encouraging stories of you getting out of friendless slumps."
1948,Anxiety,Anyone else have intense Sleep anxiety?,"I've had the specific trigger of going to sleep for years now. It'll start a couple hours before I need to go to bed and the intensity varies from night to night. It doesn't make any sense to be having an attack over what is virtually nothing? 

I'm having attacks worrying about how bad my attack is gonna be when I lay down. It's a vicious cycle. Trying to find ways to ease this besides meds. Anyone have similar situations?"

1951,Anxiety,Weird crawling sensation,"Hi guys. 

So I’ve been suffering from anxiety and dp/dr for some time now and all the while been experiencing one particular symptom I can’t explain.

I sometimes feel a tingling sensation on my feet that feels almost as though a microscopic mite or bug may be crawling on (or just under the surface) of my skin. This sensation is usually brief, around a second. But it can happen multiple times. 

I also occasionally get patches on my scalp which feel irritated and like the hairs are being moved or as though I have head-lice (I have checked, and I don’t). 

I have no obvious medical cause so I was wondering if this might be something related to the physical symptoms of anxiety. Please let me know if any of you also have this or a better explanation. Thanks :)"
1952,Anxiety,anxiety grinding/gritting teeth,What's everyone's best method of stopping yourself from anxiety gritting your teeth? It's been so bad that I have to wear my braces retainer every night or I'll wake up with my jaw so sore I can't eat. Its however getting worse and I can hardly stop myself from doing it during the day too. Any good tips/methods to break out of this before I literally wear down my teeth?
1953,Anxiety,How do I stop myself googling triggering things please?,"I tend to have lots of intrusive thoughts about a bunch of things that upset me (being invalid because of discrimination or dickishness about mental health) and they don't go away whatever I do. Even though I know logically that I'm not the thoughts stick with me and I usually end up going down a slippery slope, googling all sorts of horrible stuff.

I try and go cold turkey or follow accounts that talk about this kind of stuff compassionately and frankly but it's so hard to believe it when I'm this anxious. Can anyone else relate and if so can you suggest anything helpful please?"

1956,Anxiety,Anxiety around driving,"Hey guys, I was wondering if anyone else could relate to this. I’m 23 next week, and I still can’t drive. I’ve sat 1 test back in 2017, ended up crying and having a panic attack during it and obviously failing and have since put off doing another test. I’ve done all my compulsory lessons and just got my new learners permit. Where I’m from, is a really rural area where generally you need to drive, so a lot of times people would have been driving growing up without a license and when it came time to take the test, they already knew how to drive. It wasn’t like this for me. My parents were really unhelpful with the whole teaching me how to drive, my mother refused point blank to sit in the car with me, and jd have to ask my dad about 10 times to even get an hour a week. They wouldn’t let me practice in the car without them either. 

My partner has a car and drives, and he is brilliant and I know he will be happy to help me. I know how to drive, it’s just if I make even a small mistake il just completely shut down and start panicking. But I was wondering, does anyone else feel like this, or have had little help/ lessons even though you feel like everyone is judging you coz you don’t drive? It’s such a big thing for me I feel like such a failure because of it :("
1957,Anxiety,Is this anxiety? everyone thinks so (I don’t),"My problem started back in February, a nerve pain Im assuming shot down from my back to my legs. My bowel movement hasn’t been the same since this happened I’ve been constantly constipated. I’ve developed terrible lower back pain throughout the month of February, but it got a lot better towards the end. During this month I’ve also started feeling random nerve firings, also developed a slight sharp pain under my left breast (upper rib cage). 

Now in March I started to feel the slight sharp pain under left breast more often, then it seemed to leave a inflamed feeling right along the ribs. For a week in March I felt very week like my arms and legs especially behind my knees. I also started to see floaters , blurred vision, pain behind the eyes, and cant look up in the sky some days. Those events made me go make an optometrist appointment and he told me my eyes are perfectly fine. I’ve also been having slight pressure in my temples, but recently it seemed like its radiating to the front of my scalp. 

My CT scan of the abdominal and pelvic region came back clean besides constipation/fecal impaction. My bloodwork also came back fine. Behind my knees, elbows, and upper part of the arm seemed to be the key points thats aching. My neck also gives a nerve type flare sometimes and when I look up the back of neck aches very bad. It feels like I get random nerve firing in different areas especially my back."
1958,Anxiety,Feeling like I can’t breathe properly,Is this common? Sometimes my anxiety rises and I feel like I cannot breathe and my throat gets a weird tight feeling. And the feeling of not being a blue to breathe enough makes my panic attacks even worse.
1959,Anxiety,Driving makes me so anxious,"I'm 17f and I'm on the way of having my license so I gotta practice driving but it makes me so stressed. I practice with my dad and he tells me: ""Wanna practice?"" And just these words are enough for my heart rate to go up to the sky, feeling os shortness of breath and nausea. I hate it. I'm not that good of a driver but I never hurt someone. I have my last driving class in 2 weeks and my final exam in 3 weeks. When I drive, I'm okay, a bit stressed, but not as bad as just thinking of it"
1960,Anxiety,Surprised by trigger on date last night. Venting; Mild trigger warning for menacing/stalking,"(Apologies for mobile formatting)

I was on a first date last night. He was good-looking and things were going pretty well. I got up to go to the bathroom and came back to the table. We started talking again, and he suddenly indicated one of the female servers (not our server) and said that he'd made pretty intense eye contact with her while I was in the restroom and he wanted to do it again and creep her out. 

I just froze, and immediately flashed back to when I had worked as a server and there was this one man who used to come in and ask me out, like, follow me around the restaurant while I was serving other people. 

Anyway, I told my date that I didn't think that was funny at all. He basically scoffed at me saying, even if bad things happened to me, they didn't happen to her, which made me even angrier because of the unwanted attention and harassment women have to deal with on a daily basis, especially in service jobs. I had to go outside for a minute to calm down.  I got our waiter and paid our bill, because I wanted to leave. 

He didn't seem to think he had done anything wrong, but he did stop trying to mess with her; it seemed obvious that I wasn't going to change his mind and he certainly wasn't going to change mine.  He really wanted to pursue the subject (he is a therapist, if that matters), but he also didn't want me to leave. I told him to change the subject and he did, and the conversation lightened up again, but the trust was lost."
1961,Anxiety,Is this job as bad as I think it is or is my anxiety overblowing it?,"I can’t help but feel like everyone here really dislikes me. I already got scolded by my boss for sitting behind the counter even though yesterday it was fine (I only did it because another employee did it before me yesterday). 
I feel like I’ve been given no direction but have been told “there’s plenty of stuff to do” when I was standing behind the register but haven’t been told exactly what to do. 
I feel like everyone is watching me and waiting for me to do something stupid so they can make fun of me internally. 
I tried to talk to my coworkers like “Hey did you see all the tiny Buddha statues someone donated, how strange” and she just shut me down like “I was here when we got them.” 
I keep getting told to do one thing like “ring that up this way” but than got told off for ringing it up that way and to do it this way. 
I can’t seem to chill out no matter how I try I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. I feel like I’m tightrope walking on a panic attack."
1962,Anxiety,Anxious about meeting my parents' expectations after graduation,"I'm about to graduate college and I'm terrified.  I have anxiety but since I got on Lexapro a year ago it hasn't been too bad.  But I've been more anxious in the last couple weeks, and it's been building up and getting worse.  I graduate in the middle of May.  When it turned April my anxiety got ramped up because I knew the date of my graduation is getting closer.

After I graduate, I'm going to move into my boyfriend's apartment.  My parents know this and have discussed it, and they're ok with it but they don't like it.  I come from a conservative family and I know they are going to think I'm living in sin especially my dad (even though they lived together before they were married).  One of my big anxiety triggers is my parents having anything to do with my personal life and their judgement of me.  There's so much they don't know about me that I hide from them so they don't judge me.  In the past I worried more about losing their financial support, but now that I'm graduating, I won't have their financial support anyways.  So now I'm just worried about their harsh judgement.

I work for the school so my employment ends when I graduate.  I am looking for a summer job that will be near my boyfriend's house. (In the fall I will start working on starting my career).  I have mentioned to my mom I guess I will be moving into my boyfriend's current apartment when I graduate, and then when his lease runs out we'll find a new place.  Honestly I don't even know what my alternative would be if I wasn't moving in with him.  I don't know where I'd even go.  Nothing is set in stone yet, but it just seems like this is what's most likely to happen.  I'm worried something is going to not work out and I won't find a job, and my parents will yell at me for being irresponsible. 

I'm just so scared that my parents are going to come down on me one last time and give me their judgement before I'm financially independent from them and they can't say anything anymore.  I'm worried they're going to invade my privacy, judge me, and criticize my choices.  They're on their way to my apartment for easter right now and I'm just very anxious and scared thinking about seeing them and the future."
1963,Anxiety,Do I have a kink or is it OCD?,"
My OCD has always been a sexual issue.  

These days, I was watching a live game and there was a scene in which some bad children kidnapped another child.  

Immediately, I had a bad feeling and I remembered other times when I had this: seeing children being mean and feeling really bad. 

However, my OCD tells me that I actually felt aroused.  

Trying to remember some time in childhood when I felt aroused by something bad (like a kidnapping) I remembered a time when I watched Tinker Bell and coincidentally in a scene that she was kidnapped, I waited for something sexual to happen (I  was around 9 years old).  

But the expectation that something sexual would happen, came at various times and there was not necessarily something bad in between... 

Well, someone told me that I can have a fetish in kidnapping, which makes me very upset and very disgusted.  I really hate anything that involves aggression and everything.  

But the question is, do you think this is just the OCD acting or can I really have a fetish?  

Assuming that yes, remembering that, even though the feeling has nothing to do with anything sexual or pleasurable, I remembered that when I saw CHILDREN being mean.  Does that make me a pedo? I get so sick of it, god.  i hate pedophilia, i hate sexual assaults and i am an activist against pornography.

Ps: the feeling when seeing the scene on the live was very bad;  I've had this feeling before and it was also very bad, it's like a mixture of disgust and anger."

1965,Anxiety,Hydroxyzine Hangover,"Vistaril Hangover???

I took 25mg of vistaril last night because I have been trying to cut back on my melatonin intake and thought I’d give it a try to get some good sleep. Dumb idea. I am moving today and I have NO energy. I feel disgusting. I feel like I took 10 Benadryl’s. Any ideas how to get this to go away? Will chugging water help? I am falling asleep moving furniture 😂"
1966,Anxiety,I finally went outside and had a good time!,"I took a shower today (the second time this week and I know to some this is the usual but I struggle so bad with self care, that I feel immensely proud of me), I brushed my teeth (which I struggle with a lot), didn't forget to take my meds, dressed up nice and put makeup, ate an actual lunch my mom made AND I FINALLY WENT OUTSIDE!!

I went on a small walk to the park near my home with my mom and it was great!! The sun was warm and the wind felt nice on my face, had a bottle of water with me, was listening to music, saw couple cute dogs and I was feeling really good about myself! I was so anxious and kinda terrified about going but I actually went and I had a really nice time, I even took some good pictures of me!

I feel kinda tired now and I don't know how I'll be feeling tomorrow but today was an absolute win and no one can take that away from me 💜 Take that dumb anxiety and depression, I got the feeling good chemicals today"
1967,Anxiety,Symptoms and Emotional Wear,"I have had an anxiety disorder that was diagnosed for around a year and a half. I have been an anxious person my whole life. Because of my anxiety, I have IBS like symptoms, that are very painful and can ruin my days. This also feeds into the classic anxiety cycle of events that make you more anxious.

Over time, I have really started to notice the emotional wear these symptoms leave on me. It is hard to get out of bed because of stomach aches. I spend hours in the bathroom. I take anti-diarrheal pills every day. This just sucks, really bad. i'd like to feel ok for once."
1968,Anxiety,Tingling sensations,"One of the worst anxiety sensations that I have is random tingling sensations in my feet, arms, and face. It’s so annoying. I started a medication for anxiety 3 weeks ago, so it could be from that still, but it’s still so uncomfortable. Anyone else?"

1971,Anxiety,Feeling anxious and afraid all the time,"Everything I (20F) do or say must be done perfectly. I am a huge perfectionist my whole life, but lately, I want everyone to think that I am perfect. I am very frustrated and always analyze everything, especially after saying something wrong in front of someone. I am afraid of other's opinions to the point that I just want to dissapear. I am always worried and make the worst scenarios in my head.

Recently, I started to be so negative and annoying that I cannot stand myself, and feel sorry for people around me. Despite the fact that everything is going well in my life (pleasant family, likable boyfriend, regular college student), I always strive to be better and care too much about my appearance.

My therapist diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder (BPD) a couple days ago. I told my family and significant other. I thought they would be supportive, and also just wanted to share that.

My family now tells me I am “splitting” whenever someone genuinely upsets me, and my significant other would say the same thing. He also told me when I was upset that it’s my “BPD acting up”

I didn’t think they were going to define me by this. It feels extremely bad."
1977,Anxiety,Voice messages,"Sometimes when I’m talking to my friends who are from other countries, we’ll be typing to each other and then they may respond with a voice message. I think this is common place where there from but I’m not too used to it, and I find myself not able to respond without thinking of what I’m going to say and then it becomes too rehearsed and just feels fake and wrong. I feel like they sent the message as a voice note for a reason, maybe just to hear my voice or whatever but I can’t bring myself to respond with one. Is it rude to respond with a typed message to a voice note?"
1978,Anxiety,Does getting your tubes tied increase your anxiety?,
1979,Anxiety,Don't underestimate the influence of your diet,"I recently have been butting heads with my psychiatrist about this a bit. I was convinced that I may have an underlying issue to my anxiety that my meds were just ""masking"". For context I find that my anxiety is closely related to my gut health, and the fact that a lot of medications mess around with gut health always bothered me. After keeping track of my diet for a while I've noticed that I am very likely lactose intolerant, and am probably gluten intolerant as well. I cut both bread and dairy out of my diet for the last couple of weeks and started to feel a lot better (initially I cut dairy out and saw some improvement but I still had problems, that's when I decided to cut out gluten as well and saw even more improvement). Then last night eating dinner with my parents I all of a sudden feel my anxiety start to spike and start feeling really unwell. Turns out what we were eating was breaded with a thin layer of flour to give it a nice crisp coating. Going to be making a doctor appointment with a GP to confirm my suspicions.  


If you're struggling with anxiety and it seems to randomly flare up I highly recommend you examine what you're putting into your body that might be causing problems for you. Whether it's processed sugar, caffeine, dairy, gluten, excessive amounts of salt/fats, or something else, keeping track of your body's fuel might help give you some answers. It's probably not going to be a cure all for you, but it might help smooth things out and make your life a bit easier."
1980,Anxiety,fear somethings wrong with me (18F),"back in january i went through one of the toughest months of my life. it was the worst thing I had ever experience, so many personal problems and much stress due to school led me to have terrible anxiety and it led to me suffering constant chest and shoulder pains which lasted for days. i was terrified, but i had been diagnosed with anxiety before and had taken anxiolytics (lorazepam). In January I ran out of them and I got sent to a psychiatrist, told him my symptoms with chest pain and he told me it was because of my anxiety and prescribed me with the same anxiolytics, but I currently don’t have them anymore.
In February I moved to another place and found myself being way more calm and happier, hadn’t had any chest pain in a month and was content, but I started to get anxious about my physical health. Everything was a reason for me to be worried, I got paranoid out of anything and googled my symptoms all the time, and it was always nothing to worry about but I couldn’t convince my mind it was nothing. 

Long story short, one day I was having a pretty bad day and got anxiety at night. I got a tough chest pain which freaked me out, it was hard to breathe and I got a random urge to cry out of nowhere. It lasted for a few days then stopped. Everything went back to normal, I was fine and had no problems until today… I saw a post of a girl which explained her brother had died of a heart attack and doctors always told him it was anxiety and didn’t care. Once I read it my whole body just froze and I started to get the most paranoid I had ever gotten. I told my friend about it and she tried to calm me down but my mind wouldn’t let me not think about it, and I’ve been thinking about it for the whole day. This lead me to start focusing on my chest and shoulders and they started to hurt, and I got chest pain again! Wohoo. I was hanging out with friends when it happened, I couldn’t have a good time because I was so worried, I was distant and wanted to go home, I didn’t want to be there and felt an urge to cry. I was nervous and so paranoid, couldn’t stop thinking about it. When I got back home it got worse because I tried to sleep but couldn’t, I couldn’t stop focusing on the pain, I couldn’t stop remembering the post I had read and I started to have trouble breathing and began crying a lot out of the fear, I got so so overwhelmed and so worried about my health I couldn’t help but to cry desperately. Has this ever happened to anyone else?"
1981,Anxiety,Having anxiety from social media,"Does anyone else get nervous from just posting something or writing a comment? I've heard from many people that communicating online is much easier for them than in person, but I'm not like that. Almost all the time when I make a comment somewhere I'm shaking and sweating, and if people don't agree with my opinion, I'll be embarrassed and think about it for days. Even getting downvoted on Reddit gives me a rush of adrenalin and makes me want to delete whatever got downvotes. Is anyone in a similar situation? Thanks for reading (and sorry for my english lol)"
1982,Anxiety,It's so hard making friends.,"Not only do I feel anxious when approaching someone new, but also anxious the entire relationship, worrying that they'll leave me because of how boring and annoying I get. And honestly it sucked cuz I am the one who'd always have to start the conversation, meaning that it's almost impossible for me to have friends."

1984,Anxiety,"Dear brain, I am DONE letting you and anxiety rule my life",I’ve been having panic attacks since I was 6. I’m almost 23. Anxiety has been a constant force in my life and has rarely successfully served its actual purpose. That ends TODAY. I don’t care how anxious something makes me. I don’t care how badly I’m going to feel like I’m dying. I don’t CARE. I’m taking your fucking power away and I’m doing it now.
1985,Anxiety,How do you cope with post conversation anxiety?,"Trigger warning, maybe? 
Almost everyday I have at least one conversation I just cannot stop thinking and criticizing myself about. I've had anxiety attacks just thinking about them and no matter what I tell myself, I still feel like such an idiot/screw up about everything."
1986,Anxiety,How do I stop comparing myself?,"I’ve had anxiety since my childhood (I’m 30) i think my anxiety is ruining my life. I have no career, I work dead end jobs that leave me depressed and my friends and family are all doing better than I am..I just learned my cousin got an amazing job and is pregnant finally, my friend got married to a wealthy man and hardly speaks to me anymore..I just am weighed down by depression and anxiety. I was on lexapro but the side effects weren’t good so I got off. I have no health insurance for therapy. I guess I’d like some advice, ways to not compare myself to everyone. I am tired of feeling like this😞"
1987,Anxiety,are meds not worth the trouble?,"ive recently recovered from a negative side effect from my second anxiety med. last night i rushed to the hospital with a 150 bpm and luckily was able to sit outside without going in till i recovered.. but it still took me 5 hours just to get back to a HIGH normal.  there was a month in between when i was able to handle it all on my own. my heart rate during anxiety attacks would never go higher than 110 and was usually 101 at its worst. i still had days in between when i obsessed over my health and my body felt filled with anxiety but as soon as i started taking these meds it felt like i just reset on all my progress. i actually went in to the ER this morning cause my bp was too low for me at 57ish still completely healthy just not used to being healthy  


should i just tell my doc i can handle well enough on my own, or keep searching for a solution?  


 to be completely honest im looking for anxiety meds i can take for a few months while HOPEFULLY i get back to normal after a head injury. and then come right back off of them."
1988,Anxiety,A Long Road,"2021 has been overall terrible for me. From the get go.  It started with me getting abdominal pain under my left ribs. It eventually became worse with joint pain. I eventually went to the ER and got a CT scan after constantly being anxious about it for days. They did blood work as well. They said nothing was wrong and it didn’t go away. From there I got more symptoms of pelvic pain, ear pain, jaw pain, burning when peeing, testicle swelling, rib cracking, Nausea, the list goes on and on. I kept going to the hospital at least six separate times from early January till January 20 something. My birthday was me on the ground writhing in pain after throwing up my sushi and freaking out. Eventually the day after my birthday I got a call from one of the hospitals that I had Lyme disease. I began doxycycline and still doubted that’s what it was and over the next 4-7 weeks was getting better eventually having almost no symptoms. After the seven weeks I went off of doxycycline. My anxiety was down I was talking with a therapist about coping skills, I started skiing and working out. A few days after the doxycycline ended. I began worrying intensely about my heart. Worried it was to low at night constant checking it. Then I went to the cardiologist and everything was normal. I’m still waiting on my echocardiogram though. I then got this terrible headache that lasted for three days off and on with jaw pain. I began having shortness of breath. Got a Covid test and it was negative. Got a CT scan of my brain and it was normal. Got an x ray of my lungs it was normal. I’ve gone completely backward and barely eat always depressed scared I’m dying from anything from a PE to ALS (because my leg muscles twitch). All of these things are things that can be explained. But I have shortness of breath that comes and goes. Ear ringing that started after I had a sharp pain in my lower back which I’m certain is from my cervical spine being out alignment which I was going to a doctor for months ago. And it was out of alignment which would explain the terrible headaches. Or the anxiety explains that. Anyway. I guess the whole point is I don’t know how to feel. This whole thing has been an incredible strain on my relationship with my family and girlfriend and I don’t know what to choke up as anxiety and not. Is it possible to have shortness of breath despite not actively panicking? All my O2 levels were normal. Every time I have some little thing happen I immediately think I’m dying from some stupid nonsense. It’s draining."

1990,Anxiety,Stuck on what to do :/,"Hi, I’m 14 years old and 99% I have some sort of anxiety disorder. I have heaps of the ‘typical’ symptoms and get panic attacks every week or sometimes more often. I’ve told my parents (both in the past two days actually) and my dad who also suffers from anxiety is booking me into the local GP to get a ‘test’ done (not sure if this is what happens everywhere, but it’s basically a checklist type of thing where they ask questions and give a score at the end). However, my parents are both under the impression that my anxiety is not very bad (mostly because of my age) and that it isn’t affecting me much when it actually is, particularly the fact that I make excuses to stay inside all day, I cannot talk in front of people etc. which they don’t seem to realise is making my life much worse. I’ve told them it’s worse than they think but it doesn’t make a difference. Because of this, they want me to try therapy. I’m not 100% sure what therapy entails, however I know I will need to be open and talk to the therapist and as I mentioned I am terrible at talking to people. I also have a feeling any type of therapy isn’t going to work - that ‘gut feeling’. I’ve tried many things myself without a doctor, therapist etc such as meditation and mindfulness but none of these help, especially when I have panic attacks or anything related to social anxiety. My point is, I’m extremely sure that therapy won’t work but my parents are extremely against me trying medication (not sure why, considering my dad is treated this way). I don’t know anything about medication, or whether it will work or not, but I’m just sick of feeling like this all the time and don’t want to waste time with therapy."
1991,Anxiety,Finding a dental insurance. Is making me feel crazy.,"I just recently moved here. So, I'm a permanent residence. There are just some stuffs that are limited to me. I have to buy an insurance for my teeth since I came here, a year ago. I haven't been able to go to a dentist as they are pricey. I have braces, BTW. So I haven't done any check up or any sorts for a year. Right now, I have a cavity that hurts. Most dental insurance here don't cover orthodontist and I've talked to a few of them. I feel soo stressed and the anxiety is building up to me. What if I'll live with this braces and cavity for another year?? I can't afford the braces treatment myself. It's too pricey and I have other bills to pay such as school. My cavity hurts but I have braces so I have to go to an orthodontist which will cost more than normal dentist. I don't know what to do. I've never really had to think of this stuffs before so, I feel overwhelmed. There is another choice for me to go through which is to take the braces off and get the cavity which will cost me a minimum of $500, it may look cheap for some, but it's hella expensive for me. I'm not rich and we are having problems because of covid. My father's business went bankrupt. He's struggling. We all are. I posted something this already to a different sub-reddit, but the answers are saying it's my fault and I guess it is. Idk, I don't know what to do. Maybe it is my fault. I'm just done with this. I can't."

1997,Anxiety,It’s the Chest Pain for Me.,"TW: death 

Okay so....... my mom passed (but I’m dealing with it), I got a new job (it’s not super high stress), and I’m living at home with my siblings while we go through court stuff, but I’m in counseling and on 150 mg of Sertraline! 

Still, almost every night, I get the sharp, momentary, feels like anxiety chest pains. I can’t help pressing on the spot (which hurts), because that’s what I used to do when they started. I’m panicking because I’m thinking “what if this is something worse? I don’t want to die! I want to live a long life,” and then I just spiral. Does anyone have any good advice on this? I had a physical in October and was told my heart sounds fine? It’s not a constant pain, and I don’t really have it when I’m not thinking about it. 

Tl;dr: how do I talk myself off the chest pain = horrifying terrible the Worst Thing cliff?"

1999,Anxiety,This Is All New To Me,"Hi all,

I’m new to this sub and new to everything that’s going on with me. At this time I still don’t have any answers, but I’m almost certain I’m dealing with high anxiety. 

This past November I took a trip to Colorado and on the second night there is where this all begins. I laid down to go to bed and all hell seemed to break loose in my mind. The room started to spin and I felt extremely confused. After finally finding my way out of the dark room I noticed that my heart was beating crazy fast +200bpm according to my Apple watch and I could barely breath. My throat was closing and my extremities, including my head were tingling and going numb. 

I was 100% certain that I was having a heart attack and was dying. When EMS arrived I remember that they gave me Ativan to calm me and that was all I remember from that night. The next day the nurse at UC Health told me when I got there they could see my heart beating through my clothing and that I was near heart failure. My Troponin levels were elevated during my first blood test but not during the 2nd and 3rd so this could have been a false positive. All X-rays, EKGs, and CTs were good and I was released to go home the next day. 

However, this was only the beginning as I’ve been struggling with this ever since. I ended up back in the ER a week later with the same exact scenario, just not on the same extreme level as the week prior in Colorado. 

Fast forward to today and my heart doctor found nothing during the echo test and doesn’t seem to think anything is wrong with me. 

I’m having a very difficult time believing this and honestly feel like I’m dying. It’s getting harder to fall asleep at night as I feel like I’m struggling to get enough air when I breathe, my vision is constantly blurry and leads to dizziness. I’m having trouble just basically functioning right now. It’s hard for me to talk about things because it can easily throw me into what I’m assuming are panic attacks so I don’t talk about it often but it’s getting to the point to where I can’t even get out of my bed and there’s no way I can continue down this path. 

I’m two weeks away from my first therapist meeting. I’m hopeful that this can be beaten as this is terrifying and it’s completely overtaken who I am. 

Any input is appreciated. Also, feel free to ask me questions if I wasn’t clear enough on certain aspects as I’ll gladly answer. 

Thanks!

But eating it is also not making me feel good, and I’m packing pounds on like crazy. I am afraid of feeling crappy when I go to work, so I’m to the point where I’m eating it at every meal even though I know it is not good for me, out of fear of feeling bad. Any advice? I feel crazy"
2001,Anxiety,Getting over abusive relationship.,"It’s been about two months. I’m doing alright, but I learned that my ex had cheated on me with a married woman. Seeing someone I called my ‘best friend’ do some very awful things, hurt. 

I’m an empath so I always try to see the good in people and I no longer could see the good in her. I don’t wish this on my worst enemy. Each day is a new day, I write, eat well, exercise and take care of myself. But I’d be lying if I said this isn’t haunting me. I’m hurting still. Deeply."
2002,Anxiety,Feel anxious going home/being in my own home?,"As a child, I've always felt anxious and a sense of dread going home after leaving a friend's house or somewhere fun. (For context, my friends were always way more well off than us.) Originally thought it was because I hated the shitty apartment we lived in (and was really embarrassed by it.) And I assumed this feeling would go away when I was no longer poor. But for some reason, the same feelings still come up, sometimes with no trigger. I feel intense anxiety and dread about driving home or even being home, even though this is the most comfortable home I've ever lived in. I end up driving to pass the time or going on a walk to avoid going home until it fades. I live here with my husband and our dog and there's absolutely nothing wrong with the house. We've made so many happy memories here so I'm really confused. It doesn't make any sense. If anything, this would be a dream come true for my inner child (no cockroaches, mold and it's an actual house?!) Tried meditating on it, writing about it in my journal and googling it and still can't find an answer... does anyone else relate or have any insight? 

Would love to figure out the source of this so I can try to work on it."
2003,Anxiety,My mom is making me hate myself more.,"****POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING: Health Anxiety, Depression, Thanatophobia.****

I quit vaping almost a month ago due to health anxieties making me afraid if what it could possibly be doing to my body. The first week, I had such bad panic attacks that I was convinced I was having a heart attack and was about to die. My pulse was over 100 even while i had been resting, and I was constantly taking my blood pressure which kept rising and rising.

I went to the ER, everything looked completely fine and my heart rate went down to a 75-80 as I sat in the hospital bed. I knew that it was anxiety at that point and I was fine for the rest of the night. Come the next day, a new bodily sensation sent me into another spiral. I then went to my gp again where she and my nurse practitioner both said I was completely fine and everything looked normal and that I’m most likely harboring guilt about my vaping habit (which I kept hidden from my parents until the day I quit).

I’m seeing a therapist now, but it’s getting to be too expensive because of an accident that happened to my family about 2 weeks ago, so I’m currently trying to scramble to figure out how I’m going to keep going to therapy. 

I’ve talked to my mom multiple times about my triggers, how my thought process goes, etc. and she said she understood... yet she keeps doing and saying all of the things I asked her not to, but adds a “I don’t mean to trigger you or whatever, but..” as if that makes it alright. 

She keeps saying stuff like she can’t wait until I feel better because it’s getting annoying having to deal with me like this. Or she’ll snap at me when I start panicking and tell me that my panicking is gonna send me into an early grave... which is again not something I wanna hear when I’m having health anxiety (as well as something my therapist very clearly pointed out as a false statement anyway).

I started having really sharp chest pains after basically being in a constant state of panic (with varying degrees of severity) since i quit smoking, and I started getting really scared about it all and spiraling. I kept it in as much as I could and tried to deal with it before going to my mom, but I couldn’t handle it on my own anymore so I went to her. 

She’s always invalidated my feelings whenever I would talk to her growing up, so repressing is something I’ve done since I can remember and also why I started vaping anyway. It was a false sense of control for me I realize. It also managed to keep my then undiagnosed PTSD, anxiety, and depression locked in a box so that I could feel numb whenever I wanted. I guess stopping vaping is forcing me to face all the emotions I convinced myself I didn’t have. I’m constantly scared that I’m gonna be punished with death for my mistakes, though. It sounds silly to my mom and she makes it a point to let me know so. 

I just wanna stop feeling like a burden to everyone. I wanna be able to live my life and be the person i was put here to be. I still don’t know my purpose, I’m not ready to die.. but she led me down a path of scary thoughts where I thought.. she’d be better off if I did..

Idk. This all probably sounds dumb. she’s taking me to get my chest x-rayed tomorrow so i can shut up so.. yeah."

2007,Anxiety,How Covid has ruined everything for me,"I am in my 30's now and my whole life I have had issues with extreme anxiety and depression. Right before Covid hit last march I filed FMLA paperwork with my job because I was just not able to cope with anything and this would allow me to take time off to go to the doctors and work on myself. The same month our whole company was set to work from home. During this time I have been working from my bed room and completely isolated from the world from the most part. I didn't really mind the working from part of this but socializing outside my house has not been an option. I couldn't even go to meet up groups to talk to people or talk to a therapist during this whole times unless its done through a web cam. its just damn stupid so I never did it.

Between extreme isolation and and just having general anxiety because of CovID where the entire planet is quarantined  REALLY messed me up. This took me to whole other place in my mind that I have not went to before. Every 2 months I would get an update from work on when we are going back to the office. Now 1 year later I am told I will need to go back to the office at the end of this month. I feel if they just said well we have 1 year from now until going back to the office I could work on myself and be mentally heathly but instead im just worrying every 2 months on when im going back and now the time has came. WTF is this shit. I was already doing horrible before and now Covid really fucked me mentally. I have so much anxiety going back to work now after 1 year, I have been throwing up every because of this shit it really sucks. I have no idea how I am going to get through all this. 

I'm sure other people are in the same boat as me. it Just sucks and I have no idea what to do. I am dreading coming back to that noisey office after 1 year of full isolation im having straight up nightmares about it and throwing up during the day. I just have no idea what to do!"

2009,Anxiety,"I quit my anxiety inducing job today, feeling depressed though.","Hello,

I'm 27 years old. I live at home with my parents. I made bad financial decisions when I was younger, before I understood any semblance of math behind it. Incurred quite a bit of debt. Just a little background, where I'm at.

Well, today I quit my job of about two years. I've worked alot of different jobs, this one I would say was the best job I've had. I learned alot, I was making about 33k a year and I was really good at what I do. Thing is, job is high stress, dispatching at a plumbing company inside the call center. I hated call center work in the past, but as a dispatcher I thought I had broken out of that phase since I was really just talking to the technicians mostly. Then I realized I was still working as a call center rep, just talking to my coworkers and not the customers as often. I had alot of duties, because I was reliable. But it was just growing depressing and tiring, 4 aclock hits the corner I get 80 people calling me asking all types of questions. My boss, my foreman, the techs, etc. Anxiety.

Bad sleep pattern, couldn't eat due to stress I've become a twig, no fitness. No cardio. No social life. All of this due to the long hours, and the exhaustion. The dread. Today I quit, I emailed my boss and said I resign and I can turn my work phone in tomorrow. And I clocked out. 

Now I'm just feeling like a bad person, leaving them high and dry like that. I've done alot to get us where we were, but I put us in a bad spot with no notice to end my story there. I oubviously feel guilty. I just want to rely on my savings for a month or two and devote all my time to bettering the essential habits I had long neglected. The fitness and everything I mentioned. I'm prescribed xanax and I want to figure out how to get off it. All the vices that got me by in a high stress environment, I just want time and space to seperate myself with these crutches. And improve my well being.

I guess all I'm writing this for, any thoughts would be appreciated. I just feel quite a bit of derealization right now about what I chose to do. Any input or advice, pretty much any type of response would be helpful. 

Thanks for reading"
2010,Anxiety,"After 4 years of depression and anxiety, I'm starting treatment","Hi heroes! My most pressing issue at the moment is tight head and neck muscles, this happened after what I presumed a panic attack. Three weeks after the attack, the head tension still persisted.

2011,Anxiety,I had an anxiety attack in a zoom call in front of my professor,"I have struggled with anxiety since I was around seven years old. I’m now 18 and in college to become an elementary school teacher. I am in a math for elementary education class, and we have a quiz today that we had to take a while on the zoom call. My professor is not the most patient person in the world. In fact to make the story easier to tell I’ll just call her Karen (I promise this is nowhere close to her real name). I was already anxious about this quiz, and I logged in a few minutes early to the class, where there were a few classmates there but no professor. Once the professor and everyone else joined, she started talking to us about the quiz, and told us to turn our microphones on, which mine was. One of my worst anxiety triggers is being called/singled out in front of a large group of people. She said in front of the entire class “(my name), mic on.” which it already was. When I am feeling heightened anxiety, it will sometimes manifest as anger, and I am also an extremely bad overreactor. I slammed my computer shut. I have an additional monitor hooked to my laptop, and the zoom call just transferred to the monitor but turned my camera off. I panicked because I knew that this would anger Karen, and frantically reopened my laptop. No one noticed, and we went to individual breakout rooms. I got into mine, because because I was feeling so anxious, I placed a sticky note over my camera and pushed my laptop back until the camera was facing the ceiling. I began my quiz, and a few minutes later Karen arrived to check on me. she told me that if I did not have the camera facing me, I would get an automatic zero. This triggered an anxiety attack. I began to literally sob in front of the teacher and also became very angry. she kept going on about this automatic zero and didn’t seem to notice that i was not in a good place. She left and I ended up being fine, but it was embarrassing and I know I was being rude here, but I honestly do not know how to control my being rude when I am anxious. right after I finish that quiz, I got in contact with my doctor to seek help."
2012,Anxiety,i just want to sleep,"every night i go to bed my brain thinks about death. the inevitable end of me existing. the end is inevitable and that i accept but it feels so horrible. i lie in bed and i'm assaulted with stabbing pains and i just feels like screaming and crying. i can't tell my friend, my parents are in bed, i just want this pain to end and get to sleep. i just want the pain to stop."
2013,Anxiety,Intense fear of abandonment and trust issues,"About three years ago, I broke up with my then boyfriend of 3 years. Ever since then, all of the men I have seen/dated/hooked up with have been quite bad to me. I have been ghosted by many of them, and have received a lot of mixed signals. It has resulted in a lot if trust and abandonment issues. I have the feeling all of my friends could leave me at any moment. I constantly question my own feelings, think that kind gestures don't mean anything, and that everyone around me has ulterior motives. I don't trust people when they are nice to me, especially men. I expect men to only be nice to me or want to talk to me because they want to have sex with me. I don't trust men to see me in any way that is not sexual. I expect them to ghost me and treat me bad. 


I myself find it quite extreme that my dating life has shaped me the way I am, but it is what it is. It has resulted in me seeking constant validation and affirmation, and living in constant fear of being abandoned by my friends. I get attached to people extremely easily, and it takes me months and months to completely get over someone I briefly dated for just a few weeks, to give an example. 


I hope to be more independent in the future. I hope admitting all of this to myself is a good first step. This is the first time I've ever put into words somewhere and it is a really big deal for me. Thank you for reading this."

2016,Anxiety,I need help...it's crippling..in a way.,"Short back story, I used to drink heavily (12 or so beers per day) didn't matter the time of day. I went to work, etc..high functioning alcoholic for sure. Then one day I experienced my first ever panic attack, went to the ER ... everything fine of course.

Fast forward 3 years and I struggle with anxiety daily, but not panic. I'm able to shop alone, go to work fine, fall asleep fine.

My issue is I can NEVER feel happy or relaxed. My anxiety attack a few years ago kickstarted some depression I feel like.

I turn to beer, but only 2-4 cans..BUT just about daily. Not to help with anxiety so much, but depression...boredom...maybe both? Social anxiety for playing games? I'm a mess basically. 

My question, what can I do to help feel more relaxed and not so paranoid for no reason. Any herbal teas or anything? I want to avoid medicine because I feel like I'm not at a severe level for that, but I also want to avoid beer. Sorry I have been drinking so this post may be all over the place."

2023,Anxiety,I can’t win,"Anxiety is a curse. 
99% of the time my anxiety is at a high. It’s constant and relentless, never ending. Heart palpitations, shortness of breath, shakiness. Always. And for no reason at all most of the time. 

But what really frustrates me is the few moments when i’m feeling okay and actually at peace, I start to panic shortly after and it never lasts because my body is threatened by me actually feeling calm.

I have panic attacks BECAUSE I feel good. What kind of sick game is this. 

I was feeling fine all day and then I started feeling extremely uncomfortable because of how okay I felt. Then came the heart flutters and the hyperawareness of my breathing and then of course the derealization. 

Every damn time. 

I can’t escape. Why is my brain so against me?"

Im not confident in my social skills. And i have a hard time deciding what i need to do to help my self and to think about my strengths. I dont know if this is anxiety or not.

I hate myself for what I did and about 10 years after I did it all and pulled myself out of the gutter, I tried to correct some of my mistakes by reaching out to the people I fucked over. I didn't expect forgiveness but I wanted to apologise for who I was and how much of an absolute dick I was.

But I always wake up with these thoughts in my head, before my fucking alarm goes off and I don't know why... Fuck I hate this shit."
2027,Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my life,"TLDR: I’m really struggling and a bad session with my therapist today has left me feeling hopeless and defeated. I can’t keep living like this and I’m scrambling trying to help myself not completely drown in my problems. Being told I’m only in this situation because I’m not trying hard enough to get better is the biggest slap in the face. I just wish I had someone who understood that I’m doing all I can do right now. 

- 

Sorry for such a long post. I don’t know what else to do right now and am hoping someone who’s gone through something similar can offer support or advice on how to not give up. 

-

Last October I finally made the decision to seek professional help for my mental health struggles because I was in a pretty dark place and finally worked up the courage to see a therapist. I wanted so badly to just feel better. My grades were the worst they’d ever been (I’m a junior in college), and all the things that I’ve been ignoring and suppressing my whole life were finally catching up to me and I felt like I was drowning. 

In December, my therapist suggested I get screened for ADHD due to some symptoms he thought could be related. I ended up seeing a psychiatrist and got officially diagnosed with ADHD - combined type, anxiety, and depression. I started stimulant medication for ADHD which my psychiatrist told me could make my anxiety worse at first. 

A month after starting my medication my psych prescribed me an antidepressant to help tackle to anxiety and depression as well. I was on Prozac for 3 weeks and felt like I was literally going insane. I have never experienced anxiety that bad in my entire life. I started having anxiety attacks multiple times a day, my intrusive thoughts became so overwhelming I could hardly hold a conversation, and I experienced physical symptoms that included headaches that never went away, jaw clenching and teeth grinding, sweating, and swallowing become really difficult because I had a constant lump in my throat.

My psychiatrist took me off Prozac a week ago and told me to start Zoloft today. I can barely function and feel worse than I ever have before and am terrified to start Zoloft because I don’t want it to effect me like Prozac did (and still is). 

Today I met with the same therapist I first started seeing for the first time in 3 weeks and was hoping I’d feel at least a little relief by talking through it to someone who could offer support and advice. I have developed a really good rapport with him and he’s been pretty helpful thus far, but today’s session was awful. 

The session started normally and was fine for the first 10-15 minutes, and then he said some things that really hurt me and made me lose hope that I’ll ever get better. He basically insinuated that the only reason I’m not making progress or feeling better is because I’m not trying to get better. That I can’t keep making myself the victim and doing nothing to help myself and expect to ever get better. 

The whole session made me feel so hurt, hopeless, and frustrated. I am trying to hard just to hold on and not let myself drown in the shit show that is my brain, as much as it may look to him like I’m not. I am constantly overwhelmed and doing my absolute best to not give up, but hearing someone I have confided in and felt comfortable with say these things to me has destroyed me. 

I feel like no one can see that I’m doing everything I can to hold on. I’m not making any obvious progress because all of my effort and energy is going towards simply surviving. If even my therapist thinks all my problems are my own doing, I can’t imagine what everyone else in my life thinks. I am so scared and running out of energy to keep myself afloat. 

I don’t even know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. If anyone is feeling the same way, you are not alone. If anyone’s gone through something similar, how were you able to save yourself? I will do just about anything to stop feeling like this."
2028,Anxiety,How do you go to sleep?,"Recently I realized that I've been having a lot more trouble going to sleep, even when I'm exhausted. My head will hit the pillow, and even though I'm tired, my inner voice just sort of takes over and before I know it it's 3 am and I'm no closer to fall asleep. I've tried clearing my head by going for a walk before bed, meditating etc. I've been taking melatonin to help me go to sleep but I always wake up tired and I'm worried that's not a good habit to have for my sleep.

Any tips, tricks, or advice is awesome."
2029,Anxiety,Opinions on people forcing help on you when you're having an attack?,"This person might be on reddit because they were advicing me to do something I read on reddit I think.


But basically I'd been anxious for days about travelling somewhere. It goes up and down and I was at a peak for a while and decided to let it out on Twitter a bit about how it sucks. I was asked to suck on an ice cube. I didn't want to do it. I usually just go through it and even if I did it it's just going to go down and come back later. I explained this and they asked me to just do it.

When I don't follow through the advice given I feel guilty like I'm choosing to suffer and I don't really want to heal or feel better. Accidentally telling people who don't understand It is also a pain. They just tell me ""see you're not going to do this. You're doing this, you're not going to be scared"" like it doesn't work like that. I also get sent random things they find online about anxiety, and I know it's done with good intentions but I'm not just anxiety? I appreciate it but like I don't know how to explain this. I will then have to accept it and do as told or I'm lying.

I was assigning myself a task to go to the store and buy something once for my social anxiety as someone had suggested. I told this to someone to make sure I follow through and don't back out. They told me ""go every day. Just do it. I know someone who was scared like this and he did this and it helped."" 

I wish I had people in real life who understood because I constantly have to deal with this everything is so hard and I want to tell someone it's hard for me, like please acknowledge this is a real something I'm not making excuses why would I want to not be able to do basic every day things.

I'm currently in the middle of explaining why I don't want to travel for 14+ hours in public transport to go attend classes because I'm scared of getting the virus and I can't mention anxiety because it's not a real thing but I've been stressing about it for weeks now."
2030,Anxiety,GAD or Ptsd/c-ptsd? I’m such a mess :(,"I’ve had anxiety for as long as I can remember. I was never able to pinpoint where it was stemming from. But, recently I found out that when I was 5 years old I was sexually assaulted by my brother who was 20 at the time. And looking at the medical files it seemed to be pretty bad. I have memories from my childhood. And since I’ve learned that this happened sex just makes me feel depressed...and since this came to light I’m just confused on if I have ptsd, GAD, or both. I relate a lot to what I’ve read about c-ptsd. But, I know I can’t self diagnose. I have no money for therapy and I’m honestly scared to go to therapy because I’m going to start remembering my repressed memories and I feel like I’m just going to get more fucked up rather than get better. What if what I remember is just too much for me to handle? What if I just break and I’m never the same? I was so close to my brother...and a lot of the things I like to do I used to do with him. He’s a big part of who I am...and now that I’ve learned this I feel like I’m stuck in a body/life I don’t want. Like I’ll never get rid of him...he will always be a part of me. I still can’t believe it...like I’m hanging on to this hope that somehow nothing happened. But that hope is stupid, because I saw what the doctors wrote and I know that it can’t be nothing. And he wasn’t charged with anything because it went through family court because I was in the middle of getting adopted by my grandmother (my “brothers” mom) and he was a minor. Also the doctor literally lied in court. Everyone in my life completely failed me."
2031,Anxiety,Falling asleep with heart palpitations??,"I haven't had a hard time falling asleep due to me being focused on my heart beating, but ever since almost a week ago I choked on my gum and I was gasping for air for over a minute. After that my chest felt really tight, and now I'm even more scared that there's something wrong. Now I'm constantly putting my hand over my heart, seeing how my heart is beating cause my anxiety is so scared that I'm dying at 19. How do I convince myself that other people go through this and calm down? I've been awake for hours just scared my heart is going to ""skip a beat"" again. I had an ekg done today and it was normal. But I can't wipe it out of my head that I'm OKAY"
2032,Anxiety,Shaking,"Hi, I'm going to seek help when I go back home to my country. But I just need to know how to deal with random shaking and feeling sick all the time. I cry a lot on my own for no reason and I feel like my ears sound weird when I feel intense. Sometimes I get tunnel vision, but only when it's really bad.

 I breathe heavily a lot, especially when I'm out - or at least it feels that way. I do feel like I'm overreacting but I don't know. I just need some advice. I've been trying calm myself down by putting my hand on my chest and breathing slowly but it doesn't help. I'm trembling too. I just feel so stupid. It's also hard for me to meet new people. I feel like I need to grow up, because I'm 20 and I still feel like this.  I've felt like this for as long as I can remember and I just want to be in control of myself. Please. Thank you"

2034,Anxiety,Change in anxiety,"For the last year or so, I’ve been experiencing a fairly steady state of anxiety related to my international long distance relationship and the complications that COVID has added to that. For a long time, I didn’t have the words for what I was experiencing (I was mostly blaming my wife for how I was feeling, which was disastrous for us, but seems like we are pulling through now), but around two months ago, it finally hit me that the problem is at least in large part in my brain. Since then, I’ve started therapy for my anxiety and have done a lot of work on myself trying to get to the root of the problem. I’ve made some awesome progress; I have a lot of good days and have felt more often like myself in the last month than I have in the last year. With that said, I’ve had relatively frequent slips back into an anxious state (maybe half a day to a day a week). These episodes are far more intense than the long term stuff I’ve experienced, and I feel like I came close to having a panic attack today, which is new for me. Has anyone else experienced this? Maybe this is a symptom of me finally rooting out and working on the underlying cause of my anxiety?"
2035,Anxiety,Do you have intrusive worrying about bad things happening to your s/o?,"I often worry about things happening to my girlfriend. I am, however, not sure whether these are realistic or intrusive.

Some examples of my thoughts include her going out and getting kidnapped or attacked or something harmful.

The thing is, these seem to me to be valid concerns, but may be overboard for others. My girlfriend is on the smaller side physically and we live in an area with the occasional crime.

Do these thoughts happen to you? How do you manage between having a realistic concern and an intrusive worry"
2036,Anxiety,My mind won't shut up,"Last few nights, I haven't been able to sleep because my head grows too hot with racing thoughts and headaches. It keeps whispering terrible things about my relationship, the one consistently good thing in my life, as being something to consider throwing away. All day, too, my brain feels warm from overworking; gives me headaches and lightheadedness. I'm scared I'm sick in the head, mentally and physically, but I'm scared to see a doctor in case it's true. I plan to see a therapist, as a start, but I don't know if I'm gonna be able to quiet it down in time. Hopefully I can sleep tonight."
2037,Anxiety,Helplessly Backed into a Corner with Little Hope (Trigger Warning Possibly),"I just don't know what I am supposed to do. I feel trapped in my head and unable to escape the walls of my own prison. I deal with large amounts of anxiety now and depression to the point where I just want it all to stop. I don't want to kill myself nor hurt myself and I dont want to die. 

Basically I am suffering from thoughts of failing in college then being in a sea of debt. It has left me restless with imsomnia and made me worry or fail more. Im in a viscous cycle and I just want help. I also found myself in the wrong genre of music which also contributed to this. Slipknot, Korn, Five Finger Death Punch, Disturbed, etc. That was what I listened to until recently it was nothing but slipknot and korn. I also live in isolation in a apartment styled dorm and normally go outside 2 times a week. Im am introvert and shy around others. I also have bad social anxiety and I have hardly any trust in people I dont know. I feel as if someone is out there following me or stalking me. 

My friends have sent me to a hospital after my anxiety or panic attacks so I could seek help there. But hospitals have been known to put me under large amounts of stress or anxiety since I fear the worst. I didnt want to go but I thought I had no choice. When I was finally in they did the usual procedures up until they said they needed to do blood work on me. Now call me a wimp but I get weak and lots of more anxiety at the sight of any blood. (Hemophobia). I refused to let them do it to me and since I am old enough to make decisions. They couldnt do anything. But the thought of it as I type this out is making me squirmish. I have had it done before and I did get very close to passing out with my face flushed white as snow. I dont like the procedure nor the pain. 

Call me more of a wimp, I also cant swallow pills. I have taken pills before by either turning it into dust form and eating it in a sandwich (worst sandwich ever). Or by sucking on the gel pills and drinking the liquid with the help of water then spitting out the gel casing. I have tried to practice with ice or m&amp;ms but I just cant swallow it. I either gag or panic from the stress or anxiety it causes me. It also does not help that someone I knew passed away on accident not too long ago from taking anti-depressants and non-prescribed herbal medicine together. 

I want and need help, but because of the things mentioned above I feel as if I am barred or restricted from receiving professional help from a psychiatrist or whoever. I dont want anything medicinal, I just want a more natural cure. There has to be another way rather being prescribed happiness pills and relying on those. I just want someone to talk to that knows natural ways in which I can fix my mental health and not force me into a corner with no help unless I get blood drawn then get pills. 

Im hoping this post reaches someone who will understand my situation and suggest what I should do. I will not be getting my blood drawn, that is my stance, and I know it could help me, but I will never do that. Its just all too much for me to handle."
2038,Anxiety,Trying to Cope,"I'm struggling really hard with anxiety related to my job, where every time I make a mistake I feel like everyone is going to finally reveal that they've secretly hated me all along and then I'll get fired from my only chance at balancing out my life. This happens with every level of mistake, from more common small ones to the (rare) larger mistakes. I do my job and I do it well, rain or shine, no matter how I'm feeling in a mental/physical health sense, but I'm still severely anxious every time something goes wrong and it was somehow related to me. I'm trying to tone it down and not be a burden to people, it's not my coworkers' fault that my brain is constantly on fire so they shouldn't have to deal with it or work around it. It's just hard to live in my own head so much and feel like everything I say is too much. 

I recently got a promotion that I worked extremely hard for, and now that I have it, my brain is in abuse survival mode where I'm on my best behavior going above and beyond to try and mitigate any removal of the ""privilege"" of being promoted via doing something to make the GM or owner angry, or making mistakes and such. It's utterly exhausting but I can't shake the feeling that the owner is gonna realize I'm not actually what he's looking for and then I'll lose this chance at finally getting to a secure place in life. 

I can't tell if I'm asking for advice or venting tbh, but thanks for reading."

2040,Anxiety,I can’t “disconnect” from myself. I can’t shake this hyper self-aware feeling and it’s driving me literally crazy. Idk if it’s dp or what but it’s a horrible feeling.,"I’ve been stuck like this for years it feels. Maybe there’s been breaks here and there but for a while it’s like I’m just hyper self aware and self conscious of everything-my own thoughts, my body, sensations...I can’t lose myself in thought or daydream, can’t enjoy a movie or book...I thought depersonalization was like a dream like state where things don’t seem real but shit seems too real for me, too in my face...so I’m left not understanding this...I mean I know what’s caused it...being chronically stressed and anxiety ridden everyday for years, bad ocd that’s kept my focus inwards, drug abuse, benzo use, possibly some bad times with marijuana when it turned on me and started giving me horrid panic attacks in my late teens, severe bullying that went on for years that my shrink diagnosed me with cptsd for...whole bunch of shit I guess that got me like this and makes me realize there’s probably no getting out of this feeling...I feel numb and blank...I’m not overthinking as my dumb fuck worthless shrink says, I have no thoughts anymore basically, blank like I said...no emotions, just uncomfortable and squirming in my own skin. I don’t think I can take much more time feeling this way it’s Fkn disgusting and not worth living with. There doesn’t seem to be anything that makes it better...drugs relax me and ease it up a bit my awareness is still so extreme and focused on myself."
2041,Anxiety,Please help I'm being gaslight by my mom,It's a very long story but my mom is not a good person she cheated on my dad with a guy I thought was my therapist who was actually and is very much a creep who would get half naked photos of me from my mom and photos of my face and claimed he can heal me if he has photos of me. He even told her to touch me down there and itl heal my anxiety which she did and ultimately molested me. She screams at me when I confront her about the molestation and deflects the situation. I keep going back to her every few months after not talking and thinking she's changed but she hasn't. She lives in another country with this man which I hate and have severe PTSD from and she had the audacity to video chat me 2 months ago with him in the camera and not understand the shock I felt when I saw him. I haven't talked to her since. Yesterday was my birthday I turned 24 she sent me balloons and cake and told myself I wouldn't talk to her and now we are having regular conversations because of the stupid cake and balloons made me want to text her thank you and it led to us catching up. I feel so fucking stupid im such an idiot I miss my old mom and that's what I want back but she's abused me on so many levels and even said I'm a waste of space and If she commits suicide I'm the reason for it and like I mentioned before she molested me. I just need to rant and I feel so stupid about talking to her like everything's normal when it's not ugh. Can someone help me and talk me out of this or explain why I'm such an idiot...thanks..
2042,Anxiety,"I feel this severe and irrational anxiety when I see people my age or younger than me being « successful » on the internet (youtube, tik tok...)","I’m 26, I have a correct corporate job with a correct salary, I don’t love it but I don’t hate it either. I guess it pays the rent and give me flexibility to buy what I want. I’m not struggling with money or worrying how to end the month financially so I should be « happy » (even more during this pandemic) but I am anxious that I’ll have to stay in a 9-5 job forever because I’m so scared of failing that I don’t try and start something on the side that could lead to another thing. And this has given me the most intense anxiety for so many years seeing those people being successful on the internet through social medias or blogs.

I’m mad at myself for not creating like a youtube channel when I was younger and now when I see those teens or 20s (or even people in their 30s that started during their 20s) that live thanks to their online revenues I feel so anxious/jealous like I wasted my life and that I could have done something creative and earn money while doing it. But at the same time I don’t know what I want to do and as I said I’m so scared of « failing » that starting something scares the crap out of me. 

I wish I could put less pressure on myself and start a youtube channel just for fun and because I like doing this type of things but I always go back to comparing myself to those 17-18ish with millions of followers and millions on their bank account and I’m honestly mad at myself for feeling like this...

Last night I posted a video on tik tok to start somewhere and let me tell you I have had the most horrible night ever, I was feeling so anxious during my sleep, thinking that anyway it’ll lead nowhere and that I shouldn’t have even tried... I hate this self pressure and I hate thinking that if you are 25 and not doing what you like you failed your life :(

Do some of you feel the same ? Have you managed to control this anxiety/jealousy ?"
2043,Anxiety,Eye twitch?,"I've recently developed a right eye twitch. It's kind of like a spasm. It's not super aggressive and I've not been sleeping well  or staying hydrated. I'm also overdue for an eye doctors appointment, nothing wrong with my eyes just a regular checkup for contacts. I'm just trying to let some of this covid stuff blow over before I go. I've done this in the past but my anxiety has gotten VERY bad this past year and I tend to blow things way out of proportion, and make them last much longer! Has anyone else ever done this?"

Every weekend is filled with things that have to be done and chores to get ready for the week. By the time everything is done, it's Sunday and the work week starts again.

It just never ends. I feel like I am constantly drowning in tiny tasks. I can't get them all done and so I always feel guilty when I'm trying to relax. I feel like I can't do this forever. What's the point of life if it's just constant work, stress and chores?"
2045,Anxiety,Does socialising leave anyone else with a sense of loss?,"I socialized with some old friends yesterday (online) and even though I admit I had more fun than I expected and dare I say I even had a good time, I'm left with this feeling of loss. For what exactly, I'm unsure. Maybe it's a feeling of loss for the time I spent with them. That's time I spent being anxious with friends instead of laying in bed hibernating and recharging. Maybe it's a feeling of loss because now I'm alone again I miss the social closeness that I had for a moment. I know I won't have that again for a while because my anxiety will keep talking me out of it. Can anyone relate to this? I just want to spend time with people without feeling regret."
2046,Anxiety,Research call: Has your diagnosis ever been changed or removed?,"Hi everyone! I am a researcher in the School of Psychology, University College Dublin, Ireland, working in a team that are recruiting participants to hear their lived experiences of changes in their psychiatric diagnosis.

**Have you engaged with mental health services?**  
**Have you ever had a psychiatric diagnosis removed, replaced, or supplemented with a different diagnosis?**

**Consider participating in our research project!**

We are a team of researchers from University College Dublin conducting a project called Lived Experience of Diagnostic Shifts in Adult Mental Health. This study has received ethical approval from the UCD Research Ethics Committee.

For people experiencing mental health difficulties, it is fairly common that their diagnosis will change over the course of their engagement with mental health services. Diagnoses can be changed for many different reasons. Despite the frequency with which this happens, no research has explored how people experience these ‘diagnostic shifts’. Our study aims to identify how diagnostic shifts affect people’s lives and any challenges they may present. We want to use this information to improve support to mental health service-users during this time of transition.

For our study, we would like to interview people who have experienced a diagnostic shift. We would like people to tell us, in their own words, how they understood the reasons for the change in their diagnosis, and any positive or negative implications it had for their lives.

2047,Anxiety,I hate this shit I hate anxiety so much,"I stress and worry about everything, I always overthink things, my mind just doesn’t stop, when it gets bad I can’t think at all. But I keep passing it off as normal and I’m just overreacting. 
First thing in the morning I somehow find something to worry about. Then during the day I’ll have more racing thoughts. And these go on all day and all night if I can’t sleep. It’s like a cycle of non stop thoughts. My brain doesn’t turn off. It’s always thinking about something. I don’t know how anxiety does it. It somehow infects my mind all the time. 
Also the anxiety attacks, holy shit I hate them. The other day I was waiting for a teacher meeting and I started hyperventilating so bad I threw up in my mouth. 
And there are physical symptoms as well, but there’s honestly too many to list. Heart palpitations are the main one, so I worry if I’m gonna have a heart attack and die. 
Fuck this shit I hate it"
2048,Anxiety,I can't fall asleep because I'm anxious about not getting enough sleep.,"Yes, I'm on reddit, because being alone with my thoughts is 10x worse.

Been having an attack for days because of school assignments. They aren't even difficult or long, but thinking about doing them makes me feel like I'm leaning over a cliff.

I'm just so tired of feeling like this, and feeling like there isn't anything I can do about it.

After writing this I realized it might come off as suicidal, don't worry, I'm not. I'm just exhausted."

2050,Anxiety,Constantly nauseous.,I’m very unhappy at work and it’s triggering for a lot of reasons. It’s gotten worse and worse to the point where I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about work the next day. But even worse than waking up is my anxiety is now making me feel constantly nauseous. I could even throw up right now if I thought about it too much. I’ve applied to tons of jobs but rejected from every one so far :(
2051,Anxiety,I'm just tired,I feel nobody will ever understand me. I'm always having anxiety and people around me doesn't even help. My parents would always say accept everything because that is life. But when I'm trying them to stop talking what they say doesn't even help and further makes me feel bad. They get angry at me. I'm just very tired.

2053,Anxiety,How to calm down when feeling anxious,"This post might be a trigger. I'm not sure.

I got matched with a girl on Bumble and we've been chatting for a couple of days. It's been good and she mentioned that she's interested to know me better. I  feel the same about her as well. But the problem is that she usually takes her sweet time to respond to texts and I get too anxious about it if I don't get a response say within an hour or so. I did talk to her about it and I feel she is not being unreasonable. It's just I'm not able to manage my anxiety properly. I used to feel anxious before as well but recently it's become really hard.

How do you handle your anxiety in similar situations?"
2054,Anxiety,I broke the loop for the first time!!!,"I can definitely tell I'm getting better! For the first time in months I DID NOT Google a strange bodily feeling this morning.

Had the strangest feeling flush over me and my first thing I'd normally do is start with Dr Google right away and then convince myself I've got a super rare cancer or something then start to panic which would put me in a low anxiety mood all day.

Not today anxiety NOT TODAY!

The war is not over but I won this battle!!!!!"
2055,Anxiety,Fear of heart attack keeping me up again,"I developed this fear several years back and only just shook it recently with a trip to the ER. It only took the one for me, since I'm 21, don't smoke, no history, no problems exercising, everything came back great. I have also had very frequent checkups for other things lately and they've listened and everything still sounds OK. My blood pressure has never been bad, nothing. 

Recently, I started birth control, and I think the clotting risk (though it may only be for people with a history of clotting?) may have kicked it back up again. Also, I think reflux may have just caused a burn or something, because there's this pain at the center-left of my chest that gets worse when I breathe and just sits there. It's been there for a couple of days. 

Tonight was particularly bad because I woke up feeling weak and had waves of nausea. Cue mild shoulder, arm, and jaw pain (this has always happened; my body mimics symptoms of things when i know about them). Then, of course, I started feeling like I couldn't breathe. My panic attack calmed down pretty routinely, and I can breathe again, just not too deeply. Still, I can't shake the feeling that this chest pain/tightness that's still sitting there might be the one time I'm wrong. 

If anything, I'm just getting this out somewhere while I wait to feel OK enough to sleep. I want to put all this to rest, and maybe someone who has experienced this may have some tips for convincing themselves it's fine for long enough to avoid a trip to the ER. I keep googling, it keeps telling me to call 911, but I cannot afford that right now when this is 99.999% likely to be these other health conditions I know I have. Especially since I feel fine (for me anyway) now. 

I just hope I don't have another panic attack tonight. I was on a roll before this."

2058,Anxiety,How to do acceptance of the anxiety ?," I have read a lot of posts here regarding acceptance that you have anxiety. I have anxiety disorder and it's getting better in my opinion day by day. 

But I have some days that something happens (e.g. had a job interview few days ago and I am waiting for an answer - and I kind of stressed out, more money, better conditions but a lot of work then my actual job) I am getting really nervous, impatient, or having different anxiety physical symptoms. 

In my mind is - yeah ok, I accept them, it's who I am now, It will pass someday. 
But the thing is that sometimes it works, and sometimes is not, and when not I suffer mentally and physically and it affects my life completely. Can't focus properly have no mood to go somewhere besides my home and so on.

My therapist says each meeting the same thing - accept that I have anxiety 🙃  and they will pass. 
But i do not seem to actually know how to do it...
Is there anything that I can do to learn how to do it ? 
Thanks !"

2060,Anxiety,"Coping with the past, trying to live in the present.","Since the pandemic, I’ve been having intense levels of anxiety and continuously hyper fixate on the past.

I’ve definitely improved since then, but I can’t help but feel like I’m a lost cause because of how shitty I was back them. Then I spiral and convince myself I’m a total fuck up now. This cycle has been happening frequently for me and I’ve lost a lot of sleep over it.  I’ve tried reaching out to friends on the topic, but they don’t quite seem to understand.

But do you ever feel so much anxiety in your body when someone does this to you and so you go down the past and think of every single person who didn't bother to reply to you and then you also never had a chat with them ever again? To me, it feels like the end of everything and since I've just one or two people I call friends, things become much worse if they also do it (although in their case I know they will get back to me at some point). Is it a normal thing to just go out of people's life that it shouldn't matter at all? Sorry but I had too much inside so I had to vent today."
2066,Anxiety,Anyone with similar problem?,"Hi,

i will try to describe my situation with as little words as possible.

26 years old. It all started when i got a job in another country and had to move there. No friends there, everything is new and i lived alone in the apartment for about 10 months.

After i quit my job back then to move to the new one, i got a Atrial Fibrillation attack and that destroyed me mentally (i was a very active &amp; health person back then). Since my job in the new country asked to travel a lot with a car, that wasn't a problem until a Atrial Fibrillation attack happened again when i was stuck in a highway traffic jam. Seems like i developed a fear that when i am somewhere where i can't exit to safety or when i am far away from a ER (or any hospital), i get so much nervous because i think what if a AFIB attack happens again and i die? Luckily my cardiologist told me that there is a low risk for me to die since my heart is healthy and strong. I was given propafenone to use as ""pill in the pocket"" solution when the AFIB kicks in.

I went to almost every doctor to find out what was happening with me because that AFIB attack was new to me and some new disease came along (GERD, bowel inflammation...) that i haven't had before. They said i was almost perfect healthy and that i need to check with a psychiatrist. I was given alprazolam 0,25mg and that helps when the anxiety skyrockets because when i get in the situation that provokes my anxiety such as being in a place far away from safety or ER (highroad, plane or lets say woods), i could trigger a AFIB attack. 

I try to do the exposure therapy by facing my fears but it is not easy since the symptoms are so hard to manage (heart palpitations with potential AFIB depending how intense does the anxiety get, pins &amp; needles, chest and stomach tightness , feeling very lightheaded as i am gonna faint, face gets hot and feels like i am losing blood from my head, hands and legs).

What would you guys suggest? I hope i am not the only one. My thought is to continue with the exposure therapy and use the alprazolam if needed (i don't use it anymore as much as before ; 1 and half year free from that drug). Hope that meditation will help too."

I am a 25 year old female with social anxiety. I tend to avoid a lot. I need a lot of time to get ready in the morning and I like to follow a certain order of things. I also struggle with leaving my house when it’s messy or if I haven’t vacuumed for instance. If I wake up in the morning slightly too late I cancel any plans I have because I won’t be able to stick to the things I normally do before I leave te house. I can’t pinpoint exactly where this behavior is coming from. Social situations I like to avoid altogether. I am in therapy and working on my social anxiety. If the routine/house cleaning thing is related to social anxiety I don’t know, it doesn’t feel as if it is. Does anybody recognize this? Or have any tips? Thanks in advance!"
2070,Anxiety,"I'm not certain, but I think I just had an anxiety attack, have no prior symptoms afaik.","It's kind of just there in the title but for background, this is what happened. I'm writing this more for myself but any advice is great. Basically it went down like this. I was playing through some aim training, which is what I usually do right before I head off to sleep. I was adjusting my hand to do something and went from sort of a claw grip to fingertips only, and something just stopped me, right in that moment. The next thing I realize, I'm playing through a run and doing way better than my average. I realize at this point that due to my old mouse which I had switched off of just yesterday, I had changed my grip to accommodate the mouse, most likely.

That ""most likely"" triggered... something. It was like I was stuck in a loop of thinking. ""I changed my grip for this mouse. But when did I change my grip? Why dont I remember?"" That last part, it just kept repeating and repeating, like an echo chamber inside my skull. ""Don'trememberdontrememberdontrememberdontremember"". If you've ever seen one, it was like those ""madness"" scenes in anime where a single word is written on the background over and over. It scared me. I don't scare easy, but for some reason not remembering this one detail about how I hold the mouse triggered what I can only guess was an anxiety attack.

 I guess I'm looking for guidance? Advice on how to deal with this? This has never happened before and while i dealt with it this time, I'd like to know if there's a way to prevent it, for my own sake. Again, I was mostly just writing this to get it out of my head.

TL:DR I just had an anxiety attack for the first time and don't know the first thing about preventing future ones. Help."
2071,Anxiety,Constant chest pain that last for days - what do I do?,"so, like it says in the title, i’ve been having this constant chest pain that’s lasted for a few days now. it feels tight and it’s um, painful to move or when taking bigger breaths. 

i’ve had these chest pains in the past (well, highly similar ones) and that really worried me. i had to go to the ER, i had to get multiple blood tests, i had to get an echocardiogram (and the outcome wasn’t bad, so that’s a good thing.) ...but that was about 2 or 3 years ago. since then, i’ve been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, a mood disorder, and minor ocd. i’ve been taking antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication for just over a year now, and they’ve helped. like, i haven’t felt this kind of pain in years!

i’m just wondering if anyone else has experienced this, or something similar to this, where the chest pain lasts for a few days. i ask this because i can’t quite remember if in the past, my pain lasted for days or if it was just from time to time.

My heart was racing and my hands were clammy, I couldn't think properly and my throat felt like it was closing up.

Then you are worrying that you have exposed yourself and feel like they won't take you seriously and you feel embarrassed.

2083,Anxiety,Tips to gain better control of your mind.,"
So, you want to.

Maybe you want to stop thinking about a recent breakup, or feel discouraged from a year of physical distancing and want to embrace a more hopeful perspective.

Unwanted thoughts can cause plenty of frustration and distress. You’re not alone in wanting to make them go away. It’s normal to have trouble convincing yourself to look up when feeling downcast in the face of stress and other challenges.

While actual mind control belongs in the realm of science fiction, you can work to change your mindset. It might take some effort to learn the trick of regaining control, but the 10 strategies below can help.

Identify the thoughts you want to change

It goes without saying that you have to figure out what’s on your mind before you can begin to control it.

Nearly everyone experiences discouraging thoughts or emotional setbacks from time to time. If you’re currently experiencing some life challenges, you might find it even harder to maintain control over spiraling thoughts or your overall mindset.

Occasional intrusive thoughts are pretty normal, too. They can be distressing, but they often pass as quickly as they intruded, especially when you don’t engage with them.

Other troubling thought patterns might include:

rumination, or looping thoughts

negative self-talk

cognitive biases, or errors in thinking that can affect your choices or interactions

a fixed pessimistic outlook

Identifying specific thoughts and patterns can help you make the most out of the other tips that follow.

Accept unwanted thoughts

It’s human nature to flinch away from pain, so of course you’d prefer to avoid thoughts that cause distress.

Yet pushing away unwanted thoughts isn’t the way to gain control. That usually just makes them more intense.

Instead, try the opposite: Accept those thoughts, and let them in.

Say you feel a little low because nothing in your life seems to be happening the way you planned despite all your hard work.

Acceptance might involve telling yourself, “Nothing seems to be going right, and that’s discouraging. There’s only so much you can do to create change yourself, but giving up entirely isn’t the answer either.”

Acceptance can even offer clues as to why specific thoughts keep coming up.

Maybe you keep thinking about a fling who ghosted you. Accepting those persistent thoughts leads you to recognize that you really wanted your connection to last.

Their disappearing act left you with unresolved questions and an overwhelming sense of unworthiness. You worry you’ve failed at dating and feel anxious about trying again.

Acknowledging these fears allows you to confront them and remind yourself that you’re not to blame for their bad manners.

Keeping the situation in perspective can help you manage your worries about it happening again instead of letting fear hold you back from finding someone new."

2086,Anxiety,Anxiety and seeing distorted faces?,"I've always swept this stuff under the rug but maybe I shouldn't have. I've looked through the subreddit and saw a lot of posts about hallucinations before sleeping or right as you wake up and some about seeing stuff move out of the corner of your eye just to realize that it was a stationary object. 

Well I used to see distorted faces in my peripheral vision and I'm wondering if anyone can relate. For example, I would be sitting on the bus on my way to school and I thought some random person was staring at me with a scary expression on their face (sometimes almost monster-like) but when I turned to look at them straight on, they were always minding their own business and all I could see was the back of their heads. And this would happen multiple times in a single bus ride (not every day though). I always thought it was related to anxiety and stress so I wasn't too worried, does anyone have similar stories?"

BuSpar I initially had few side effects other than emotional instability, headaches, dizziness, and light sensitivity the first 2 weeks. My doctor wants to try Prozac because I am having panic attacks immediately as I wake up, and she thinks having something in my system long-term would help. Now to note, I have emetophobia and I am absolutely terrified of the idea of possible nausea or vomiting side effects of medication. It took me forever just to try the BuSpar. Prozac seems to have nausea as one of the side effects. Anyone have any experiences with Prozac overall?"

\-----

For my entire life, I worried about my health. Whenever I began to feel the least bit sick, I would hop on google and try to diagnose myself. When I was younger, this wasn't so much of an issue because I didn't have any recurring health problems, but In 2014, I started to have daily migraines and dizziness. I went to specialist after specialist to try to get help, but despite all the diagnoses I got - of vestibular migraines or inner ear problems or neurological issues - no one had an answer. And of course, the time I spent worrying and googling skyrocketed until it was occupying hours each day (among some other unhealthy obsessive habits I had). Then, in 2017, I started having panic attacks. 

They were little ones at first, ones that lasted 20 or 30 minutes and only came once a week or so. But at the end of April of 2017, I had the big one, the one so many of you are familiar with. 20 minutes of adrenaline, rapid heartbeat, and nausea turned to an hour, then to a half day, then to a week, until panic became the new norm.

In the month of May 2017, I slept for no more than an hour a night, lost over 15% of my bodyweight, and spent my entire waking life in my own personal hell. I got caught in a loop of having thoughts of going crazy, then googling symptoms of psychotic illnesses, which caused these thoughts to come back harder. I couldn't eat or sleep, I was barely drinking, and I was spending my entire time focusing on how awful my symptoms were.

In late May, I was given a book by my mom. I don't remember the name, but I do remember that the central tenet of the book altered my understanding of anxiety. This crappy little book claimed that certain mental behaviors we did actually *fueled* the production of adrenaline in our body, and that by cutting off these behaviors, we could make the symptoms go away. At that point I had been suicidal for a few weeks, and I was on a whole bunch of different meds and going to talk therapy (neither of which had done anything), so I figured I would give it an honest shot for a few weeks.

By the beginning of June, the intensity of my nausea had been cut in half. I didn't enjoy eating (I didn't enjoy anything at that point), but I was at least able to eat solid food. I also noticed that the intensity of my other symptoms had gone down. I was still getting rushes of adrenaline, but rather than causing my entire body to shake, they were only causing minor jitters. I still had heart palpitations, but they were getting more and more muted.

By early July of 2017, I was no longer constantly experiencing physical symptoms. I was still grappling with instrusive thoughts about going crazy, dizziness, and fatigue, and occasionally, after a bad night's sleep, my physical symptoms would return. But my life was far better at that stage than it was when first starting out. 

In September of 2017, the mental symptoms started to go away. The thoughts of going crazy that I used to worry about so much were popping up less and less frequently, and for the first time in years, I could start to feel what it was like to be at a decent baseline again.

By February of 2018, I neither had persistent physical nor mental symptoms. Intrusive thoughts  occasionally popped up for me (which, as I now know, they pop up for everyone, regardless of their history with anxiety). But because I didn't worry about them, they never lasted more than a second or two every time they came, and I was able to get back to my day. And for six unbroken months, I finally felt normal. 

In August of 2018, I had a setback. One that I took a month off of work to resolve, and then slowly recovered back to baseline over the next two. But since then, I haven't had a single panic episode or rush of adrenaline that's lasted more than a couple seconds. I no longer spend hours googling my symptoms. I don't worry about social situations before attending them. And in the rare event that I experience an old symptom or fall back into these old behaviors, I know exactly how to respond so it doesn't last.

\-----

This was my timeline for recovery, but I think with purposeful and concerted effort, you all could recover more quickly. For that, I would offer one piece of information that was the central tenet of my recovery and I think could help a lot of you who are stuck and wanting to improve:

**Take care of your worrying, and the rest will take care of itself**. 

Since reading that original book, I've spent a lot of time diving into the research we have on anxiety and exploring how exactly our conscious behaviors affect our body. To sum up what I've learned: the adrenaline and anxious symptoms we feel aren't just the result of our unconscious brain (i.e. the amygdala) acting up - that's true for lower-order thought mammals, and is also why their problems with anxious symptoms are much more temporary and fleeting than ours.

In us humans, the vast majority of our anxious symptoms are actually the *direct* *result* of one mental behavior that we do in our conscious brain: worrying. Because of a few vital connections between our prefrontal cortex and structures in our extended amygdala, our body creates adrenaline when we worry, leading to all of the uncomfortable symptoms we know and hate. The more we worry, the worse our symptoms.

But there is a great beauty in understanding this: once we cut out the worrying, the symptoms themselves follow suit. And looking back at my own and others' experiences with anxiety, it becomes easy to understand how we have been able to recover. Our journey was one of gradually getting out of the habit of worrying - whether about external factors or the symptoms themselves - allowing us to slowly reduce how much adrenaline our body made, and returning to a symptom-free baseline.

**As long as you keep that in mind, things will get better**. SO much better. 

In those days where I was spending my entire time in bed, dry heaving and shivering, all I wanted was just a few minutes without my symptoms where I could just feel okay. I'd experienced tremendous physical pain, grief and loss in my relationships, had to push through harrowing physical experiences, and all of those *combined* didn't even come close to how awful I felt in that state of constnatly high adrenaline. 

But through that very consistent and deliberate effort, things got better. And they can for you too."
2093,Anxiety,Snowmobile crash,"Rolled my sled Saturday,

Near Luzerne, Michigan. I just got a ticket from the DNR for going 88 on a seasonal road I thought was a trail. I was mad about the ticket and litterally 2 minutes later wrecked my sled going 50. I am an experienced sledder. It was really bumpy and I don’t know what I hit but it sent my sled flying and me flying as well. Broke my hand and fucked up my shoulder. I’m thankful to be alive. Scariest moment of my life. I’m real shook up about it. I’m bummed about my sled, hospital bills, the ticket I got. If I never got that ticket I wouldn’t have wrecked GUARANTEED. My kind was in another world. Don’t let your feelings get the best of you..."

2096,Anxiety,Worst week ever,"Had the worst week for a long time. Could not eat for 3 days at all and then couldn't keep any food down for 5 days. Didn't sleep and would wake up screaming when I did. Cried constantly and screamed at my fiancé over nothing.

Finally getting back to being myself."
2097,Anxiety,I need to get a job over summer and it's freaking me out,"I have never had a job, as I am in high school. I understand that working is a part of life and I am ok with that. The problem is I have a terrible habit of overthinking things, coupled by the fact that I have a quite strong imagination, I literally am always thinking of the worst situations possible. I want to work, I want money to spend and save for college.

I keep stressing about if I work in fast food people yelling at me, which I don't really handle well, or the same in retail or something. I have kind of ignored the feeling of anxiety I have been getting from thinking about it, but recently it really is getting crippling, sometimes I can barely even do anything, so here I am. 

Please help."
2098,Anxiety,Why can't I sleep,"It's 5 am. Thoughts running wild and now the anger is setting in. That will keep me awake for even longer. God I hate this so much. 
How often do I have to repeat the cycle of pulling an all nighter to fix my sleep schedule, just to not be able to fall asleep again."
2099,Anxiety,I’m having some anxiety about school right now . A panic attack is coming,"I just moved to a new apartment and haven’t been able to get internet yet and it’s been a couple weeks.
They should be here Wednesday 
But for the mean time I’m doing all the assignments on my phone of the 30 minute break I get at work on my computer( I’m a nanny so I don’t really get a break) 
My grades are not looking too good now. MY anxiety and depression due give me extended time on SOME assignments due to disability but not all the time and I hate asking and don’t know how to. 
I failed three classes in the summer because of a relationship that gave me tons of anxiety and depression and then the break up which made things worse.
I don’t want to fail classes again. I just got my associates and now really working on doing better for my Bachelors"

I feel like this isn't the ""real"" me. I don't know if it's because of the pandemic or if it's more than that. I think the pandemic is definitely part of it. I'm so mad at myself for being this way. I don't know what's up with me. I've been having such a hard time just getting myself to go to the supermarket or post office. Once I'm there I'm usually fine, but my anxiety gets soo strong beforehand and I put it off for hours."

2104,Anxiety,What medication you on that has helped? Can you tell me how it changes you?,I am planning to go on some soon. Only thing i am concered about are side effects.
2105,Anxiety,Is there anyone here went through solipsism anxiety and got over it? It has been giving me so much anxiety and scares me so much to think that I'll never get over it.,"Although I tried convince myself many times to get over it and there's no way to disprove or prove it, it just keeps coming back. Actually, it's been a month already since my anxiety started to spike up again. It started due to the fact that I kept wanting to vomit every time I'm anxious. I was unable to live well when it started. But after a week later, I came across this thing called ""solipsism"" on the internet (I wish I had never discovered it). And this made my anxiety conditions worse. I started seeking for answers and rejections regarding this theory to make me feel better. I came across many comments that make me feel slightly better, yet I also came across comments that make me feel worse as well (something about that there's people who's been suffering from it for 15 years? I think) and it scares me so much. Sometimes, it's hard for me to interact with people around me as the thought keep popping up on the head while I'm trying to communicate normally with people. I get frustrated a lot with it just keep coming back. I really want to go back to my normal life. I have dreams and goals I want to achieve, I really don't want this to disturb me forever. I'm not sure if the theory itself is what scares me or the fact that I don't want to live with it forever scares me. I really hope that there's people who got over it and it doesn't disturb their lives anymore. This will sure give me more hope.

PS: I'm a person with anxiety disorder, (not sure exactly what type but it's very obvious to me that I do) and i have never been to therapists, or had any anxiety medication before.

Also, I think I came across this thought of solipsism before this as well but it really didn't bother me as much as right now and I really got over it that time and eventually moved on from it. But this time, I think it's mainly because of that I was already in a bad condition and this just made it worse."
2106,Anxiety,WTF happened to my memory,Today I suddenly forgot what my password was to my email account that I have been using for 3 years now. I log in to my email on a daily basis... So strange...
2107,Anxiety,Trauma response or anxiety?,"Context: whenever I get called into an office with someone who tends to be a higher up, I end up crying and bordering on a panic attack. It doesn’t matter whether it’s about something good or bad and it’s happened (that I can remember) since the age of about 9 or 10. I completely shut down and can’t look the person in the eye. 

Example: I was nervous about an appointment I went to today with a sort of middleman agency that’s helping to connect me to people with jobs available. I had been anxious all week and ended up throwing up just before I left the house. When I got there, I was ushered into a room with a lady when I was told the week before that the meeting was being led by a man which put me on edge even more due to the unexpected situation. Now not only did this woman undermine me when I tried to explain that I had a chronic, invisible illness, but kept suggesting physical labour jobs that aren’t viable for me with my condition. It was like I had just talked at a wall. Then came the waterworks. I could feel myself tearing up and no matter how I tried to stop myself, it just kept coming. For the rest of that meeting I never met her eye even though I could feel her sizing me up, waiting for me to say something. Once the meeting was over, she hands me a brochure for the manual labour job and says “I think you’ll be ok, they’re very accommodating there and it looks to me like you just have a confidence issue” 
So tell me, do I just have low confidence? Was this a trauma response to something I experienced as a kid? I want to be able to assert myself in those sorts of interactions but when I shut down it seems pretty much impossible."
2108,Anxiety,Has anyone else gotten increasingly irritable?,"Maybe it’s just this past year that’s flared it up more than usual, but I’ve been dealing with anxiety for 6 years now and I’ve never gotten as irritable so easily as I do now. The smallest things upset me so much in school and my relationships, and it’s even vaguely started to happen with my therapist. It’s like something mildly upsetting happens, I react internally as I normally do, but then externally I shut down and become kind of mean. Or I’ll just stop talking to people because it’ll continue to bother me and I’ll get increasingly upset if I do keep talking to them like everything is normal. I don’t know how to address this.  It really gets to me because I end up feeling more anxiety from the way I’ve acted once it subsides. But it’s also hard to not react in an angry way in that moment, because acting like I’m fine just builds it up even more. There’s things happening daily that used to just kind of bother me and I would move on from it, but now I just sit there seething with rage about it, unable to put into words why I’m feeling that way because I KNOW it’s irrational. I don’t really know how to make it stop. Has this happened to anyone else? If it has, how did you begin to address it?"

2112,Anxiety,I get such severe anxiety/depression with change.,"I am in my third semester of nursing school. I had my first clinical today which was virtual. Every new semester I have a total break down. My anxiety shoots through the roof and I become even more depressed than I already am. I am intermittently crying and I get so needy. I get so panicked sometimes I get thoughts of suicide, no plan but just not wanting to deal with this. So far I have done very well every semester. Highest grades in the class and good remarks from my teachers but I just get so scared at the beginning of the semester. I’m scared I won’t pass and I’m scared if I complete the schooling what if I hate the job. 

I work in a hospital and I’m not even a nurse yet and I’m already so burnt out with dealing with patients. COVID is stressing me out and seeing so many sick people coming into the emergency room is taking it’s tole. I’m not even full time. So now I’m even questioning if going to school was the right decision. I have a useless bachelors in psychology and living wage jobs in my area are sooooo competitive. You need to have so much experience and degrees. I feel so lost and sad and I don’t fit in anywhere. I also get extreme anxiety and depression when changing jobs. It’s like any change I shatter. I had a panic attack at work when I first started. I didn’t even know it was a panic attack and I went white (whiter than I normally am) and felt like I was going to pass out. 

I have no friends. I think people are my friends and I guess they just use me. I had two good friends in nursing school we had the last two semesters together. Unfortunately they didn’t pass last semester so they are repeating and we couldn’t move on together. It seems when I do well and others do bad on tests they don’t like me anymore or they need me for advice or whatever. I don’t brag at all when I do well. I don’t like telling anyone because I don’t like to make others feel bad. But they haven’t checked up on me at all just for a chat or anything. I’m always the one to text first. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. 

This semester is mental health nursing and I feel like it’s so hard to get into the mindset of helping others with mental health issues when I can’t even function myself. I feel so alone."
2113,Anxiety,"Hot coffee spilled on a customer due to coworkers negligence, anxious and need advice","Hey all, I’m wondering if someone can help shed some light on a situation that happened today at work.  Every day I have intense anxiety over certain social situations that happen and I keep replaying them in my mind.

I work at a retail store where the employees all work in particular departments, but we can cover and sell in other areas if needed.  One of my coworkers vanished from his department, and some customers grabbed me and asked if I could help them.

I went to the other department and started to ring them up, and the customer started to complain and ask me about a price.  We have registers that have a computer screen we can swivel around so the customer can see.  The customer asked me to show him the pricing breakdown of the transaction, so I start to flip the screen around and suddenly a big, hot cup of coffee that I didn’t see that was sitting behind the screen fell over and spilled all over the customer.

The coworker who vanished walked back to the counter right before this happened... it was his coffee.  We’re not supposed to have food and drink out on the floor, especially with covid... he had the coffee just sitting right next to the pin pad, on the customers side of the counter, behind the screen so I couldn’t see it.

I felt SO embarrassed and upset about it, apologized to the customer and helped him clean it up while my coworker just stands there.  After I help the customer, my coworker makes a comment about how irritated he was that his coffee spilled “well, I guess I’m going to take a second break and go get another”, and leaves his department and takes a SECOND lunch break to go to the gas station.

He made several other comments later on about how irritated he was that the coffee got knocked over.  My feelings were extremely hurt because... THE COFFEE SHOULDNT have been out on the register!  Especially hot coffee.  My feeling are hurt because, if I was in his shoes I would have felt HORRIBLE if he was in that embarrassing situation because of my carelessness.  I would have apologized or help clean it up or tried to make the situation less uncomfortable.  And especially because he acted upset as if it was my fault the coffee fell over or if the problem was that he was inconvenienced, and he was almost “punishing” me by going on a second lunch break and leaving me short staffed again.

What hurts my feelings is this is a close friend, this coworker I hang out with often and this is the only weird thing that’s happened between us.  I feel anxious over spilling the coffee on the customer, and anxious for him being mad and not apologizing, and I don’t know how to feel about it.  I think he should have taken some blame for leaving it out in the open where it could have easily spilled since were not supposed to have drinks and food at the registers.  Also, I was doing his job, it wasn’t my department and I was covering him when he shouldn’t have left it unattended... I just feel anxious and can’t stop reliving all of it"
2114,Anxiety,Just a question..,I switched from a different brand of Lexapro and I have side effects again.. Is this normal
2115,Anxiety,Some random girls laughed at me secretly for doing my best in the gym.,"Possibly because I'm ugly and skinny and they probably think because of that I don't deserve to try so hard or even being assertive or confident. Or I've been born with the face that constantly gives off the impression that I want to be laughed at. I don't know. I mean, who do I think I am when I'm this ugly. I'm here to workout though, not to impress anyone. I'm just wondering how their brain function."
2116,Anxiety,"Anxiety every day, but I never stop hoping it will pass","I have been in such a bad shape recently. My work is getting with each day more and more stressfull, my relationship of 5 years hit a rough patch and my every day anxiety is never higher. But I didnt stop believing that it will get better. I talked with my partner we are working on our relationship. Also, I finally found a therapist and we already did two meatings. It was nice to talk with somebody of all this issues I have for years. It is just the begging but I am happy I did it. Never lose hope, if you are breathing you can do it, you can work on your happiness and go foward. 

P.S. sorry for my English, it is not my native language, I just wanted to share this with somebody. Hope you are all well."
2117,Anxiety,what are symptoms that you didn't know were anxiety symptoms until you got diagnosed?,"hey there. i've always described myself as a worrier/overthinker, but i'm starting to think that it's something more. i feel uneasy almost all the time, get chest tightness, have persistent aches and pains (particularly in my shoulders and back) and am constantly fatigued despite doing absolutely nothing. i really do think it's affecting my quality of life. i don't know if this next one is related but i can't keep my eyes shut when i'm trying to sleep. my eyelids flutter uncontrollably and i have to put my arm over my eyes to weigh my eyelids down. 

i'm just really curious to know what your experiences with getting an anxiety diagnosis have been like (eg. what symptoms led you to get checked, what symptoms you learnt were anxiety-related after consulting a professional).

thanks in advance! :)"
2118,Anxiety,I cleaned my room fully today. For the first time in 4 months!,"My anxiety had been worse than i could imagine the past 3 months. My room had deeply suffered. I had clothes EVERYWHERE that just needed to be put away! Everything was just piled up. It made me so anxious looking around and being so messy and not having any space, only having my bed basically to be able to access. The thought of cleaning it made me EVEN MORE anxious and I couldn’t even get myself to do it. It was a cycle. A couple times I’ve started, but I couldn’t finish, it was so overwhelming.

Today I cleaned it all(: I put my clothes away, organized everything, I can finally play my piano and use my desk again! It didn’t even take that long, i moved through quite fast. 

I’m really proud of myself(:. Now I only have to deal with the mess in my head, aha!"

2120,Anxiety,Didn’t eat my feelings tonight after an existential crisis!,"Small victory but I’m really proud of myself so I wanted to share. Currently, I am on a weight loss journey and the last few days I have been having a lot of existential anxiety. After not eating all day and skipping work, it hit 9:30pm and I got super hungry so I made some comfort pasta and stayed within my calories for the day. 

In the past I would either not eat for days or turn to fast food but I kept to what I wanted outside of the negative feelings and I have no guilt about my several bowls of Trader Joe’s noodles. I also found an old journal and did a bullet list of my fears so I can give my therapist a full list of what I was/am fearing. Victories like this keep me feeling good about my progress! ❤️"
2121,Anxiety,I think I am so disgusting and worth nothing,I’ve always struggled with my self confidence and self worth but here recently it’s been extremely difficult. I look at myself in the mirror and all I see is a fat ugly piece of shit who is useless. I think I am the stupidest person alive and will amount to nothing. I truly believe some days that I am worth nothing and I fear that my boyfriend would leave me for someone more beautiful and skinny and confident. I am disgusting. I disgust myself. I want to lose 50lbs overnight. I want to starve myself so maybe I’ll lose weight. I’ve tried working out but I never stick with it Bc I’m fucking stupid. I’m 200lbs and I just feel awful. I want to disappear.
2122,Anxiety,Feeling detached from society,"The only person I talk to is my mom occasionally. I don’t have any friends, acquaintances, social media or online friends. No one. I want to put myself out there and overcome this, but it seems like every time I try it only makes things worse. 

I don’t know how to interact with people anymore. Whenever I run into my neighbors while walking my dogs, my brain freezes and my vocabulary gets reduced down to “hii” and that’s it. This past year, everything has gotten so much worse. Recently I realized I can’t even make eye contact with my mom anymore. With the whole pandemic and online classes, I spend 99% of my time home alone with my pets.

I wish I could talk to people but I never have anything to say. I can’t even make posts or comment on Reddit (that isn’t venting). Nothing ever comes to mind.

I have seen many different therapists, been hospitalized four times, done outpatient therapy for anxiety twice, and tried several medications. Yet so far, it still keeps getting worse and worse. I don’t know what to do anymore. I think I reached a deep point beyond the normal level of anxiety. 

I feel so detached from everything and lost and hopeless"

2126,Anxiety,Quetiapine really helps me,"Hello,

I am 13 and I have GAD, OCD, SAD and panic disorder. I got prescribed Prozac 3 weeks ago and it started to kick in 3/4 days ago. I was feeling really good. Today morning I got prescribed by my psychologist Quetiapine 25mg divised in quarter, she tells me to take it only if needed, I decided to take a quarter at 1pm to see if it was working. After something like 30 minutes I was not knowing how I was feeling but definitely more calm and relaxed in ability to think. After 2 hours I was going to bed cause I had not sleep that much last night, I taked 2 quarter and 30 minutes later I was feeling really relaxed so I sleeped from 3pm to 10pm. At 11pm I taked another quarter cause I was feeling anxious, right now I feel really relaxed. Before taking Quetiapine I was feeling really nostalgic, effraid of blue light, I was feeling hopeless and sad but right now I feel like it has completely changed my vision. I am not nostalgic anymore at all, and even if I am a little bit it's not painful like before it even feel good like if I was kind of living before if we can say that like that. I watched videos that usually make me nostalgic (pretty every videos possible) and the nostalgia is good, not painful at all just really good and relaxed. I do not feel hopeless at all I feel like I can for sure feel better, knowing that the future will be good and that I even feel better right now. I do not feel sadness at all, the pleasant effect of nostalgia make me feel great. It really does changed my persception on everything. Everything is more pleasant even watching a movie, I can now think without anxiety and just watch a movie like everyones without thinking of everything possible. It kind of numb the pain away. I know that alot of bad things is sayed on Quetiapine but I also know it has a great effect on me.

If you have any questions / comments or advices don't hesitate."
2127,Anxiety,Does your anxiety cripple you too?,"Hello, my anxiety is off the charts. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression years ago but it's fluctuated, and now with my recent marriage-separation it's absolutely ballistic. 

During the day I'm good, I'm happy and nearly no anxiety. But at night, the thoughts are never ending and I constantly feel like I'm either going to vomit or my guts will just twist and burst. 
 
My anxiety has always literally taken a toll on me, my stomach churns and I get shaky and my breathing struggles. This has been happening since 2011 and I'm going back on my medication but I'm tempted to tell them to just please give me 100 right away, rather than the slow build up from 25 or even 50. I can not sleep and I noticed I didn't eat very much today. 

Is anyone elses anxiety physically aggressive? I keep searching articles and see ""butterfly"" stomachs but this is literally like I'm on a rollercoaster on a drop, constantly. I'm sure these episodes at night are probably technically panic attacks, but they grip me all the same. Is this common?? And if not, should I do something about it?? I keep thinking this can't be healthy and I'm going to end up having a heart attack or something. 

Let me know! I'd like to not be going through this alone."

then i’m anxious as hell when i cancel bc i feel like they hate me but i just can’t help it. aside from having severe anxiety, i’m a loner. a homebody, an introvert.

2131,Anxiety,Anxiety Hangover,"Does anyone reading this experience an anxiety hangover? After 5 days of constant panic attacks and obsessive thoughts, I finally feel like myself again, however I'm so tired and achy and super tired. Feels like I have a flu, minus the head cold. Anyone else experience this? How long does it last for you?"
2132,Anxiety,I am at a devastating loss for solutions with my anxiety; Any insight helps.,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety, depression, add and ocd for some time now. Each condition has its own place and issues in my life, but my anxiety has always been the most painful. I am on a mixture of anxiety/mood depression and adhd medication and also have frequent therapy sessions in addition to the medication management.

Example  —   
Psychiatrist - “go outside, don’t think about what or why you’re walking outside. Just do it, look at the architecture, smell the air” (as a Manhattan resident I chuckled out loud at the part lol). 
Me - “well that sounds nice, but I have stuff to do like make a living and pay rent and think about. Real stuff, not superficial things made up by me, so I can’t really put those things off because they are essential.  

Recently, I’ve discovered my anxiety is my personality; I realize that nearly every interaction I have is not genuine. I try so hard to make it genuine; when a cashier says have a nice day, I yearn so strongly for me to be able to take that interaction and believe that I can have a nice day but I know I won’t. I still say thank you, you as well, hoping maybe that will spark something. It never does. I sit with friends and we conversation, shoot the shit, you know whatever; sure maybe I laughed at that joke that wasn’t funny or maybe added something to the convo, but it wasn’t real or genuine. And then when I’m done talking my mind starts it’s engine back up and proceeds to overheat, which is how my mind always is. Always racing, going around in a big circle like a tumble dryer except it never dries anything. It’s a massive jar of every situation snd scenario of everything that ever existed, frantically buzzing around and there’s a tiny tiny opening where these thoughts can be expelled into words, but the organizer doesn’t work so that shit just either comes spilling out, or the more common thing that happens; I hold it all in because I know it won’t make sense to anyone else. 

What bothers me the most out of everything is how the heck do I deal with anxiety about things that have actual consequences. Like things that I actually cannot afford to fuck up. I have anxiety shout everything, however after a panic or anxiety episode attack, I am at some point able to pick apart which triggers were due to a nonexistent fear, and which things were actually something that is a real concern. 

Like, in therapy we’ll think, ok well you love the city, you love being outside in the sir and light; how about take a walk to clear my head and reduce the anxiety. Ok. Well. Um that is not a possibility. I have rent to pay, I need to get that money by working on my computer. This can’t be put off. Oh, my computer had water damage so that can’t work either, get a new one? Nah no money for that right now. These are things that have actual consequences and can’t be solved by therapy. I am the kind of person who will get what I want. Meaning if I want to live in this apartment — the view eases my anxiety, it is exactly where I WANT to live, etc, despite the higher rent price — I will live there. Because I am living my life and trying to not let my anxiety or depression control me. If I tell s psychiatrist therapist about this, I can’t accept their all too familiar answer of “just take a break from things right now, slow down”. ??? Why would I deliberately stop doing something that is tailored to my conditions, to try and subdue those same conditions? I understand this can work for patients and is legitimate good medical advice for some, really! however not me. Many times mental health treatment comes in the form of slowing your life down to focus on your mental, but like I don’t slow down. I don’t want to. I never will because I fucking love doing things that I love and loving myself. 

Sorry that was long as fuck lol.

TL;DR what to do when many forms of treatment to “ease anxiety” are not an option when slowing down and trying to control my mind will prevent me from literally working and earning a living with the woman I love."
2133,Anxiety,How I deal with anxiety,"So I've been struggling with anxiety for quite a while now and I just want to share this, so everybody struggling with this can try this and see if it helps. So here are the things that help me with anxiety

If I'm going somewhere outside of my safe zone or home I always bring some kind of self-defense tool (most of the time it is little pepper spray on my keys) This way I feel safer and prepared if something bad happens.

Other things I usually do is when I'm somewhere outside and start feeling very bad I guess ( I don't know how to describe it I just feel like everybody is watching me and making fun of me) I start singing in my head something I call ''bad bitch songs''. It sounds hilarious, but songs like WAP or Boss Bitch really help me distract from my surroundings and give me confidence.

Usually, when I go out I always bring someone with me just to don't be alone, because going alone in stores is terrifying for me and this way I have someone who can help me and even have fun shopping

I have started playing the guitar again and finding new hobbies this has really helped me a lot with anxiety and in my free time, I try to help people who are going thru the same things I've been thru. I really hope this helps you and have a good day❤"
2134,Anxiety,Therapist recommended sitting into my anxiety,"Hi all! 
I saw my psychologist today for my social anxiety, my anxiety comes from having an upset stomach and needing to use the bathroom. Will someone know, make fun of me, worry about it etc 
Last 8 weeks it’s had me 70%  house bound and re-starting medication after 6 months free. 

Strategies I’ve tried in the 8 weeks:
1. Grounding 
2. Healing crystals 
3. Positive affirmation 
4. Exercise 
5. Yoga/meditation 
6. Aromatherapy 
7. Wellness books 
8. Cold aircon in car

I’ve been trying to continuously use them.
My therapist has suggested I sit into my anxiety and just let it be, acknowledge and take a moment to say ‘I’m not going to die or nothing bad is going to happen.’ 
Let yourself get sweaty, feel the stomach cramps. I asked ‘how do I do this’ her: ‘with a lot of practice!’ She knows this from personal experience.

She suggests this because if you feel the onset of anxiety and you jump to your strategy, then you are putting it off/fighting against. Your body thinks it can’t handle it. However if you sit into it then you’ll body will begin to see no threat. 

It’s going to be hard. Trying work tomorrow for the first time in 8 weeks! Hoping for the best.

2135,Anxiety,Acceptance,"19M.I’m sorry if this triggers anyone, but I want to get this out of the way already. I want to know how to accept my own mortality. Just to clarify I’m NOT dying, at least I hope not but thats just me being a hypochondriac. I’ve been having health related issues for months. For a month, I tried to ignore it  so I wouldn’t have to think about it. Also, I thought ignoring it was better within my family due to the constant dead ends in finding what’s wrong with me. I keep having these growing thoughts of impending doom. With the pandemic and the fear of terminal illnesses, I’ve been having a hard time accepting my own mortality. I keep thinking about how I’m not ready. Cursing myself for wasting the time I had alive. Time I could’ve spent living with purpose instead of by habit. Time I could’ve spent finding out my strengths and weaknesses. More time laughing instead of suffering in silence. The fact that my life amounts to shit. The uncertainty of what comes after death. I can’t run from it. I feel it would be better if I learned how to accept it, so I can transition into it without kicking and screaming."
2136,Anxiety,Just need someone to talk to,"My anxiety took a nice long hibernation. It was amazing. I felt normal for about half a year, with a few anxiety hiccups along the way. It wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t as bad as this. I feel it coming back again and this past week has felt like I’m holding my breath. I can’t let it go. My chest feels so restricted and I feel like I’m holding in tears constantly. I could have a panic attack any moment that I want. It’s right there, perching. Sometimes I don’t feel like I have a spine or skeletal support. I feel like water in a thin membrane and any moment, I’m going to collapse. I don’t have anyone to talk to rn who understand this, but my friends mean well."
2137,Anxiety,I have to wake up in four hours and see no chance of me falling asleep,"I love music. One of the few things keeping me going anymore is music. During quarantine I decided that actually wanted to learn how to make it myself. I can’t sing or play any instruments other than piano, so I took the time to learn to sample music and I think I’m okay at it. I want to release my first project soon, and I have all of my beats finished. However, since picking up music, I keep lying awake at night, obsessing over fixing, tweaking, and even scrapping beats. How can I take my mind off things and stop obsessing over fixing something I can fix tomorrow.

Edit: the idea of what I make not being good enough is driving me insane. I don’t know if this is considered anxiety but it’s driving me nuts."
2138,Anxiety,Anxious thoughts are affecting my sleep,"How do I control my anxious thoughts at night time?

I (29 m) have had problems with my anxiety for a couple of years. I’m in a professional career and have moved jobs a couple of times as I wasn’t happy in the companies I worked in. I most recently moved jobs two years ago and was told that the small company was fantastic to work for, but once I joined things started to go really badly and much worse than my previous jobs. The person who worked below me took an extended period of time off for mental health issues which left me to do the two jobs. When this happened I found out that the person I had replaced had taken a few months off for mental health reasons before they were made redundant. 

I am constantly thinking about work but it doesn’t physically affect me during the day as I can find lots of distractions. But once I get into bed my thoughts about work go into overdrive, meaning I struggle to breathe properly and get so hot that I’ll have beads of sweat on me, even though I sleep with a window open and the temperature outside is below freezing. I’ve been trying Meditation through the Headspace app which works sometimes, but other times my thoughts are going so fast that I can’t even hear the app speaking to me. I get about 4 hours of sleep a night, meaning I’m exhausted the next day. This results in me not performing as well as I should in work the next day which then drives anxious thoughts at night time again. I’ve even slowly cut my caffeine intake to zero and it hasn’t helped so far.

Has anyone got any tips on how to increase my hours of sleep or how to get through a tough job with very little sleep?"
2139,Anxiety,I actually feel like I have no solutions,"So back when it was my bday i got drunk, I started asking her a buncha times if we could kiss and stuff and she was saying no and i kept asking. Too be fair i was asking if it was sexual harrassment and she was like no but the thing that bothers me is I think I knew it was bad but the drunkness made me not feel guilty. And when i did feel slightly guilty I asked if sexual harrasment. And with the kiss questions I wasnt aggresive i was just asking a lot. The reason she was saying no is because my siblings were there and it would be like PDA. She says it really isnt that bad and that there were no victims. But end of the day theres no excuse for sexual harrassment even if it is my gf or even if i was drunk. There was no excuse for the sexual harrassment and I cant deal with it. Ive never had this cause this is a real bad thing I did and I just cant deal with it I dont know what too do. And we also did kiss when it wasnt PDA, and I asked if that was cause I coerced her into it and she said no but still im worried I did and that makes me feel even worse and its just all bad. And like sometimes she said no too what I thought was a private kiss and sometimes she said yes so that made me thing I rlly did coerce her but she said that when I wanted too kiss in a seperate room ppl would know where gone so thats why it was a public kiss kinda. But one time we did kiss in a seperate room so idk if that was coercian. Sorry im all over the place. But like we kissed in seperate room once, then she said no for all the other times I asked for seperate room kiss, then we kissed when my brother dropped her off and i was there so I walked her home so we could kiss. Also I think she gave me small kisses in between that I feel bad about cause i feel like that was just coerced. Shes rlly great and is fine and wants me too feel better about this and I do too, I just cant."

I’m so scared of it and I don’t know why but how do I get over that, it makes me turn in all my assignments late or not at all. How do I get over the starting anxiety? 

I want to say it’s like a band aid but with each click I feel worse and worse until I’m on the brink of collapsing in on myself, it’s way harder than it needs to be. I need to know how to get through it without feeling ill, please."
2142,Anxiety,I told my crush how I felt about them,I feel amazing right now even though she said no. A lot of my anxiety was because of how I felt about her. I think this is the best I felt in a long while. We are still friends which is the one thing I feared wasn't going to continue if I told her.

2145,Anxiety,Yes!,I am struggling with anxiety since my childhood and I have been depressed minimum over three years now.. today got diagnosed and I have got prescribed Elicea and Neurol ! Tomorrow I am starting my treatment.. Hopefully I am gonna feel better.. Anyone been on the same prescriptions? Let me know how are u doing. ❤️
2146,Anxiety,Just breath.,"Sometimes I forget to exhale completely, or at all. I won't realize I'm doing this until I go to take a breath and can't. Panic mode! I can't breath! Eventually, I'll realize what's happening and exhale. I'll then spend the next hour taking in smallish breaths and exhaling them completely to try to regain some calm. I'm not alone in this, right?"
2147,Anxiety,Does this sound like a panic attack?,"I don’t think this breaks the diagnosis rule because I’m not asking for a panic disorder diagnosis and I am just asking if this was similar to a panic attack you may have experienced. I’m gonna start this off by saying; I’m really sorry if I’m overreacting and this wasn’t a panic attack. I have a tendency to be a hypochondriac. 

So it was five AM and I was doing laundry. There was five minutes left on the wash cycle and I just got really anxious suddenly. I couldn’t think straight, I was paseing back and forth really quickly, I was wringing my hands hand out and hitting my collarbone, I was struggling to breath(this could have been because I was trying to choke back my crying so I didn’t wake anyone up), my heart was racing and felt really heavy and weird, and my stomach felt weird. By the time this stopped the clothes were done washing so it was a bit longer than 5 minutes. I’ve had stuff like this happen a couple other times but there usually was a clear reason like i was opening my computer to start schoolwork. 

Thanks a lot. Im sorry if I’m just overreacting about this."
2148,Anxiety,Having problems with the only thing that's been helping me,"I have CPTSD and GAD, and a year ago I developed a panic disorder from a session of Accelerated Resolution Therapy that stirred up a little too much. Since then the only thing that's been consistently helping me is cutting out refined sugar from my diet, a vitamin D and methylated B12 supplement, and a weighted blanket. 

The first weighted blanket I used was borrowed. When I returned it I was gifted another one, same weight but fuzzy cover. Every night I end up taking it off in my sleep because I get too warm. This is in the dead of winter with a fan blowing on me, by the way. 

Also, oddly enough, even though the blanket I was gifted is marked as the same weight as the one I borrowed, it feels significantly lighter. Maybe by five pounds or so. 

I'm not really sure what to do about this, because I haven't been able to work for over a year and so I can't afford to replace the blanket with a different one. I'm feeling my anxiety creeping back in, which is affecting my ability to stay away from sugar and stay hydrated. So the cycle is starting all over again. 

Had anyone else had a problem like this, and if so do you have any advice for me?"
2149,Anxiety,I have no motivation to overcome my Anxiety.,"My anxiety negatively impacts pretty much every area of my life - sleep, schoolwork, relationships, the list can go on and on. And yet, I struggle to find the motivation to do any of the things that could potentially reduce my anxiety (such as take my prescribed medicine regularly, eat meals regularly, or meditate)

Any advice?"
2150,Anxiety,Lexapro fatigue,"Hi, I was hoping you guys could answer a quick question of mine. I was on Lexapro 20 mg for about an year for anxiety and OCD. We weren't able to make any consultations for an year due to Covid-related difficulties. The 20mg dose did produce results but they were inconsistent. When we were finally able to make the consultation, they upped the dose to 30mg which has brought down my general anxiety and obsession-related anxiety quite a bit. But it has also made me feel completely lethargic all day which I suppose is one of its side effects. Since the clinic is some distance away from our house, it'll take 2-3 days to make a consultation. And the local psychiatrist will most probably take me off Lexapro and prescribe another SSRI which is too much of a trouble as I have exams coming up. Is it possible to take a stimulant (like Wellbutrin) to complement Lexapro or is the side effects something I just have to live with?"
2151,Anxiety,Snow gives me anxiety,"I need some advice. 

I have massive anxiety when I drive in the snow. Usually this isn’t a problem because it doesn’t snow when I have work and I used to live really close to family and would get a ride when the weather wasn’t great (I realize I’m very lucky to have this happen).

It snowed pretty heavily yesterday and is still snowing now and will snow pretty much all day (Tuesday) where I live

I work 45 mins away from where I live, the weather is similar but they aren’t predicted to have snow all day. But if you’re from New England or anywhere that gets heavy snow you know the roads aren’t going to be the best at all. 

Work was closed yesterday but seems to be opening late today. I do not feel comfortable driving to work considering the circumstances. I also do not have any other way to get there besides me driving myself. Would I be giving into my anxiety if I ask for the day off?

The type of anxiety I get when driving is the kind that leaves you exhausted for a long time and you feel physically ill. Last time I drove in the snow and had this anxiety I was off for a couple days after. I shake uncontrollably while driving and that is a hazard in itself. 

Please help me decide if I am calling out because of anxiety or weather bc if it’s anxiety I know I have to go."
2152,Anxiety,Will racing thoughts go away in time?,"Hi, i have mild anxiety for about a year. I was used to sleep with headphones listening music, but recently i started sleeping without them, and i find quite big problem for me. 

Racing thoughts...

When i lying down and trying to sleep, i hear in my mind random shards of conversations. I cant properly concentrate at something, all i can think of are that shards of random voices...

&amp;#x200B;

Will this goes away in time? Or atleast when i get rid of anxiety (i am willing to do anything for it)

Do i have hope?

Thank you very much for andswers"

2154,Anxiety,Remembering,"I’m having a hard time rn. It’s 3am and I can’t go back to sleep. I keep thinking about how much I put my ex bf through, but also how much I hid. I’m certain that taking anabolic steroids fkd with me &amp; it exasperated my anxiety to an extreme. I remember being so suspicious of everyone; random girls he’d never even talked to, I’d see them at the gym &amp; my mind would just create some stupid fkn stories. He’d go to the store &amp; I’d have to sit down to journal, internally freaking out, having to talk myself down from my intrusive thoughts. My fear of abandonment reached a level I’d never experienced &amp; idk whether it was the way the steroids destabilized my emotional regulation or because I’d never loved someone as much as I loved him, or both. I was scared all the time. I was having constant panic attacks, experiencing ticks &amp; struggling every day just to feel okay. 

Maybe it was the way the pandemic brought us together in one place so by the time the world started to go back to normal, I was codependent and had separation anxiety? Idk. I’m trying to figure it out. 

All I know is that I drove this wedge between us. I didn’t believe a love like his was real....so when it was there, I doubted it. Maybe it was all of the above; a perfect storm of chemical imbalance, childhood trauma &amp; the pandemic that made me just cling to him in an unhealthy way. 

I waited too long to get on meds. I should have done it sooner. I should have been honest about how strong my thoughts were &amp; how intense the anxiety was getting. Now he’s gone. &amp; I did it. I made him feel like he was the problem. There’s only so much someone can take. He admits that his pride made him do certain things that really fkd me up internally. Like lock his phone, not reassure me, etc. and I being told that the right person will not manage my anxiety (that’s MY job) but will be compassionate to my needs. I know. But it still sucks rn in this moment to think back to how intense those thoughts were. I feel sorry for myself because I was suffering silently for the most part, not being completely honest about my anxiety. But I also feel sorry because he got hurt. And I wish I could fix it. 

I’ve been on meds for almost 3 months now &amp; I’ve got work to do still, but it was one of the best decisions I ever made. I wish I would have made it sooner. Maybe then...... things would have been different.

[side note: I recognize that he and I not being together is for the best. He wants/needs certain things that cross my boundaries. I also realize that we would have ended anyway. I only wish it hadn’t been in this way, with such pain.]"
2155,Anxiety,Night Time Anxiety,"I feel like my anxiety/panic disorder is 20x worse during night time. More specifically, right before I'm about to go to bed. I'm currently trying to keep myself from having my nightly panic attack and anxiety fit.

It starts off with my body flashing between really cold and really hot. I start to lose feeling in my hands and sometimes experience left arm pain. I can feel my heart start to race and I get a tiny pain near my heart. Then it's just fight or flight. It feels like I'm having a heart attack. I try to stand up and then the hyperventilating starts. I get dizzy, shakey, and experience heart palpitations. The feeling of impending doom sets in. I can't breath, like someone is choking me or there's a ball in the back of my throat. Then I just start sobbing wishing this would finally pass or be over. It's become a nightly thing. I'll jerk myself awake right as I'm falling asleep because it feels like I can't breath and my heart is stopping. I have to pass out from exhaustion to get any amount of sleep.

I've had so many tests done on my heart just in case to try to put my mind at ease. Passed an EKG, stress test, echo, heart holter monitor, etc. I cannot tell you how many different medications I have tried or different kinds of therapy, but nothing has worked so far. I'm at the point where I can't even afford to keep going to the doctor or emergency room either, it's so expensive to try and receive treatment. 

I'm just extremely exhausted and tired of living this way."

2163,Anxiety,Constant need to double check everything- draining my time and confidence,"For my whole life I've had the habit of always having to double-check things, whether it be if I locked the door or if I turned the stove off, but recently it seems it's been getting a lot worse. I'm assuming it has to do with the fact that I'm stuck in my home for the whole day but I don't know what I can do to fix it.

I am constantly double, triple, and even quadruple checking things just in case the last one wasn't sufficient enough. From the same old things such as locking my doors, to newer ones like checking my  messages multiple times to see if I sent a message to the wrong person, it seems my brain can't trust itself in its own actions.

It's gotten to the point where I'm sure I have lost many minutes in a day just making sure that nothing bad could happen from my own mistake which is in itself a mistake I can't fix. I've gotten out of bed sometimes just to make sure I didn't leave the sink tap running.

I've never gotten diagnosed for anything but have not been to a family doctor in a while, and I'm certainly not in a position to do so at the moment. Is there a way to know what my situation is and if any, ways to solve my problem? Thanks"

2165,Anxiety,Job related anxiety - how do you deal with it?,"Hello there guys! I hope you're doing well.

I've been struggling with job related anxiety for a few years now. The first time I had to deal with anxiety was in my first year of college when I had to find a part-time job. I found it - food delivery. The funny thing is that this should really be a simple job, not in my mind though. Right before going for my first day, I started overthinking and by the time I got to the hub I already knew all the ways the day could've gone wrong. I was already late for work when I decided to bail because I was too afraid of what could happen. This happened two more times since then with 2 other minimum wage jobs (basic jobs where there's no need for any skills). 
A few months ago I decided that I was just lazy, and maybe working from home would be a better fit for me. Guess what? I have an Upwork account and all I have to do is apply for jobs. I know I have the skills, I have experience and knowledge, and yet I'm too afraid to apply. When I find a job I know for sure I can handle, I immediately start self doubting myself. It's like I forget everything I know about my field and I feel like I have no chance of landing the job. And there are gigs a 6 years old could do, but when it comes to applying, I already know I won't be able to handle it, even though I realize later that I was wrong.

My question is, if you had to deal with this, how did you make it work? How do you fight it? 

I mean, at this point, it's not only a matter of meantal health, it's about basic survival too. 

Thanks for your time!"

2168,Anxiety,Visual Noise caused by anxiety - please read,"Hello everyone, I honestly don’t know where else to go but to reach out to anyone on this forum for help. I’m hoping someone can read this and relate to me for some reassurance that I desperately need. Anyways, I’m 25 years old, and I’ve suffered from severe health anxiety for about 3 years now. My anxiety has caused me various health issues over the years, but I’ve conquered each obstacle by either going to a doctor to get my symptoms checked out, or by simply knowing it’s all just created by anxiety. One thing anxiety has taught me is that a lot of issues come from the mind being very negative all the time. Anyways, the most recent issue I’ve been dealing with is something some of you might have heard of before, it’s called visual snow/visual noise. I randomly woke up one day and noticed that my vision was somewhat pixilated when I looked in the dark or at blank walls/dark non vibrant objects. Now this is actually somewhat normal for everyone to a degree. Everyone can experience some form of visual noise and it’s nothing to worry about. When I first discovered visual snow, it caused me a great deal of stress and worsened anxiety, but a year has since passed and it rarely ever bothers me anymore, especially because I barely notice it unless I’m consciously thinking about it. I’ve researched how anxiety can actually cause a lot of different visual issues/disturbances due to heightened senses and over sensitization of vision being constantly in a “fight or flight” response. I actually took peace in knowing this because I improved my visual symptoms and started to desensitize my vision through meditation and other healthy lifestyle changes. On top of that, I recently got an eye exam and was told I have healthy eyes and a healthy optic nerve. I talked to the optometrist about my visual noise and he literally told me to just ignore it, and that I had nothing to worry about. However, I’m stupid and continued to lookup visual stuff online and came across a quora answer from an apparent optometrist who once again said visual noise was nothing to worry about, but he mentioned that using psychedelics could be a cause for some people. Back when I was 20 I tried LSD twice with a couple friends, and never thought anything of it until now. It’s been an entire 4 years between the time of doing LSD and noticing any visual noise/abnormalities. I had perfect vision during that period of 4 years as well. On top of that, at the time I believed that LSD made me happier and helped my anxiety for that year. Anyways, seeing this quora comment has sent me back into a downward spiral of anxiety, regret, and despair knowing that I possibly caused my visual noise from making a dumb mistake and taking LSD years ago in college. The thing is, I’m completely okay living with my visual noise right now, it’s not very noticeable unless I’m thinking about it, and I was actually improving it through simply believing I can heal myself. Now that I’ve seen this comment on psychedelics being a potential cause instead of my current assumption that it was anxiety, I’m freaking out thinking I can never fix/heal myself, and it’s all because of dumb decisions 4 years ago. If anyone took the time to read through this, thank you so much. Right now I’m really looking for positive reassurance from someone who knows what they’re talking about, and who can confirm with me that taking LSD 4 years ago is not the cause of my visual snow. My gut it telling me it’s been my health anxiety all along, but now this other idea has been introduced into my head and it’s got me down in the dumps. I’m only looking for positive reassurance right now, so if you have anything worse or unnecessary to add on that I might see, please don’t. Have a great day everyone."

2170,Anxiety,Irrational work thoughts,"So, I'm 37 and I've been in my field for about 8 years. Worked for a very large company, then moved to a smaller company. The smaller company was super toxic, to the point that a couple of years ago, i had to quit for my own sanity. I spent the next year searching for a job in my field, and am now with an amazing company surrounded by amazing people for about a year now.

The problem here is that I have this anxiety issue now where I think that any little mistake I make, i'm going to be fired and I'm letting everyone in the company down - especially my manager who gave me a shot in the first place. this has stemmed from my last role where my manager would not back me up and others in the company would go over my head to my manager just to show how bad i was (in their eyes), even though i was doing the best I could. it got to a point that my manager at the time threatened to fire me, even though it was the first time in that type of role and some of my stakeholders were notorious for being difficult. 

Now, every time i get reminded that i need to do something or people want an update on something, or maybe I've made a minor error (that's easily fixed), my mind goes back to that low point in my life, where I start thinking ""they are telling you to do this because you can't think for yourself and do it"" or ""you made this mistake, your manager isn't going to trust your work ever again"" or ""they are going to find out that you don't know what you are doing"" to eventually ""these guys deserve someone better than me"". not only this, i also feel like I'm kind of worthless in this company (and life in general these days), especially if I cant get simple things right or if I forget to do something. Totally irrational thoughts....Thoughts that keep me up all night. I get so worked up it feels like i'm having a panic attack. i feel like i'm stressing like this nearly consistently, which will put me in an early grave (IMO)! If I keep this up, I think it's going to get to a point where my company will actually let go of me, eventually. 

Does anyone have any advice on how I deal with this?"

2173,Anxiety,Feeling My Heartbeat when laying down,"I have health anxiety and OCD and am a 27 year old male. 

I have been having weird sensations in my chest over my heart  for a while now, but lately it’s gotten worse. I use to think it was from working out and I had just pulled my pec muscle or it was sore. 

Now when I go to bed and lay down I can often feel my heart beat and it makes it hard to fall asleep. Last night I could hardly sleep because it kept waking me up. 

I’ve had no issues working out and my chest doesn’t bother me during the day when I’m sitting up right. 

I started lexapro last week and wondering if they could just be me getting use to the drug or if I need to follow up with my doctor and have examination done. 

The number one thing I don’t want to happen is the doctor just tells me it’s my anxiety. Has anyone experienced this before with anxiety?"

Worsen it.

2176,Anxiety,"Hi everyone, for as long as I can remember, I have had the awful habit of picking at my cuticles when I’m anxious/bored/really just any point that I’m not already doing something with my hands. I’m in college right now and with the stress of college, my fingers look AWFUL. Any suggestions to stop?","I have tried to stop soooo many times and I just can’t. I’m 27 and been doing it since I was a kid. I also constantly chew the inside of my lip, however that one isn’t as noticeable. With my cuticle situation, I’ve always just picked at the skin but when it lead to bleeding, I’d move to another cuticle. That being said, I still picked all the time. Now with the stress from school, the blood has barely slowed me down. Every night I go to bed, I lay there and pick and then can’t sleep because I literally cannot stop. When I have sex with my boyfriend, I pick. Picking makes it easier to hold a conversation too. I pick at any and every point that it is remotely accessible to do so.

Does anyone have any advice to quit this habit? It’s gross and I’m embarrassed about how how raw my fingers look :("
2177,Anxiety,Ups and Downs an exhaust,"I’ve been struggling the last 3-4 years with mainly social anxiety. And it’s pretty exhausting. So I don’t go to school bc anxiety. Every day is the same, I wake up pretty late. Wait for my only friend to come home so we can play games. I used to have a lot of friends but I kinda fell of. Idk what really happened I started to fake sick school on high school more and more and then I stopped completely. And the social anxiety got bigger and bigger . And now I can get anxiety of family members. I have gone to psychologist but I have no idea to express my feelings and how I really feel. And sometimes I’m always happy and some days I just down want to do anything just sleep. I hate my life. I’m currently 17. The most annoying thing is, to see everyone around me succees . I have no idea why? And my parents treat my so extremely good . And a lot of times I get pretty sad bc it feels like I’m always disappointing them. While them treat my like gold. Like I don’t know how I feel. I don’t now why I’m so insecure. And why I have problems with socializing when I was younger I always was the most social kid. It’s so damn exhausting.

2180,Anxiety,Hi,"I never thought I would be in this kinda sub. I guess some introduction needs to be made. So I have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety in December last year, I may have suffered longer, probably as back as when I was 8 when parents notice I’ve changed in some ways, but how can I be sure? 

The idea of going to seek professional health started with some strangers I know (that means people I know on the internet). Some suggest that I need to seek help and at first I would say “I’m just depressed and sad,” “I was telling a sad story.” But it develops into thoughts and I said “What if it’s true?” It looks like life for me seems stale, everything I do is just to kill time and I don’t have any joy in them, like games, going to school, et cetera.

So I talk to my mom about it and about I should get checked. So she did some searching and found a center. I went there and did some talking with my mom and therapist. And I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. The depression part is somewhere between stage 2 and 3, now it’s stage 3, I think. 

I’m not sure how to describe it, because my mood goes up and down like I have a fever and cold at the same time, one hour I was okay, then later I could be in tears.

In my opinion, there’re people who had it worse than me, the people who suggest me to seek help is/was depressed themselves and they have done things that can only exist in my thoughts and not action. I’m just here to just talk about it, I talk about it to some of my classmates, my parents, my therapist, the teachers know too. 

Don’t know how this will end up, I may get some support from you guys, or I can get my dms flooded saying “you ain’t depressed,” “you seeking attention.” But whatever, what I do, Ig I’ll have to take responsibility for it, at least that’s what people say."

2184,Anxiety,"Paranoid about a cat scratch, and overthinking about rabies.","Hi, I am 18, and from the Philippines,
Yesterday my cat pooped on the floor, so I cleaned it and wash her butt and tail because a poop got stuck on her tail, and she accidentally scratched my hand, the scratch pretty much bleed a little bit, but it's shallow, and after that I started to overthink and research the whole day about rabies, I have OCD, and this really triggered my OCD and I am out of treatment at the moment.

My mother's friend got bit too, while he is sleeping the cat bit him, but he doesn't seem to care about it. 
The cat is not aggressive whatsoever, she meows a lot but she does that if she's hungry, we will gonna vaccinate her next week due to covid here in my town it got postponed, and I got scratched last month too and bleed, but nothing happened.

Someone threw the cat in front of our house so we adopted it, she's pretty clingy and no sign of rabies whatsoever, and she doesn't have any kind of foam on her mouth, not aggressive, agitated or anything. But shes unvaccinated at the moment which worries me, but she hasn't died since I've been scratched last month never got outside the house ever and she's still a kitten so no exposure to feral animals I presume. 

So what do you think?

And according to cdc even if the animal has rabies, if it's in incubation period, it can't infect anyone because the virus hasn't reach the saliva and the brain, and ahe doesn't display any rabid symptoms and when I got scratched I hold her for a minute and at that time if she licked her claws the saliva already dried down and rabies can't survive open air and die instantly after several seconds, and I am in open water when I got scratched.
And this paranoia made me overthink about my saliva and I can't stop swallowing and feeling the sensation of my saliva. Damn I am tripping hard.

Man fuck me I want this to stop"

2187,Anxiety,Weed anxiety,"

Hey guys. 

I've been on 50mg for 10 weeks now and I'm doing a lot better then I was at the start. Definitely have seen some improvement. 

There's still some days I feel down but there not as bad as they were a few weeks ago. 

There is one thing I would like to ask you guys, I don't know how to explain it but I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this.... 

There's like this place in my mind I can go to, it's kind of more like a feeling then a thought if that makes sense. Which makes my head feel tight and then I start to have a attack. It concerns me that I can bring it on just by going there and because of my anxiety and ocd I can't stop obsessing over it and thinking everyday that there is something wrong with me or I've tapped into a part of my brain that I shouldn't have and now I won't be able to stop. 

This all started for me when I was smoking weed and I had a massive panic attack, then the days after I couldn't stop having panic attacks then came the depression then came the anxiety, and I'm still trying to get over it. 

If anyone else has been through the same or feel the same I would love to hear from you so I don't feel like I'm alone in this. I'm just so constantly worried that I'm going to be stuck like this and no one understands what I'm talking about."
2188,Anxiety,No Energy,"I never have any energy even when I get 8+ hours of sleep every night. I’m currently on Effexor 187.5 mg (increased dose for about 4 weeks) but not seeing any improvement. I have been on this dose before and it worked but since then I’ve gone up and down and I just don’t think it’s working anymore. I had bloodwork done and none of my levels are low or anything.

I’m scared. I just feel like a lot of the things that can usually help anxiety take so long to implement and while working full time it’s going to be even more difficult to come off Effexor and try something new. I am trying to start therapy as well since my work comes with a plan. It’s just a lot to think about and a lot to do and having no energy to start with is a pain everyday. I do have some days that are a little bit better than others but most days at work I deal with shortness of breath, chest tightness/pain at times, dizziness, etc. Plus low/no energy of course.

Anyone else relate to any of this? I’m just stuck. I’m losing motivation for my future goals."

Currently worried because I accidentally touched my lip balm to my cheek, where I applied an acne cream about 4 hours ago, then used the balm on my lips. I'm afraid to drink water because it would pass my lips and become corrupted by the cream. Yes I'm aware how ridiculous it sounds...

Same fears with any cosmetics, hair oil, hair spray etc. Doesn't matter how many times I wash my hands I don't trust them to not have residue.

2195,Anxiety,Weird Throat Sensation,"I am 23F and have suffered with anxiety for many years. Not medicated but seeing a therapist.

I've been feeling this weird uncomfortable tightness in my throat today. But not like a sore throat, it feels as if the muscles in my throat are tightening up. I would not describe it as pain exactly. When I swallow, I get some temporary relief and then it feels like something is stuck in my throat again. My anxiety has been pretty high the past few weeks and I hope it is attributed to that.

Unfortunately, a lot of my anxiety stems from COVID and health anxiety in general so of course I am panicking and thinking this is a symptom (I have 0 actual symptoms/have not been exposed to anyone with COVID). When I get distracted, the sensation goes away as well.

Anyone relate?? Or am I going crazy??"
2196,Anxiety,How to deal with unexpected changes?,"So this is just throwing me for a loop. I have been actually doing really well, handling my OCD, anxiety, depression. I've been doing the best I've actually ever done in my life. This pandemic, and even recent family events have thrown me for a loop but I've taken it in stride and been able to create a good foundation for myself to keep calm and push through.

But, I'm having really trouble with a new unexpected change that just popped up. My roomate just told me very much so out of the blue that he is looking to move out. We are good friends, and have had a great time living together but he is looking to quit his job and save money. Totally understandable. But for some reason, I am feeling so down and lost about it. I know I'll be able to push through but I think I just hav always had so much trouble with changes, especially sudden ones. I had just gotten to feeling so happy and comfortable in my home and now thinking of having to start all over is just making me feel so unsettled inside. 

I know I'll push through and life is all about adapting, and this is little in the grand scheme of all I want to do but it still gets to me. It makes me feel like my foundation is being rocked a little. Anyone have any advice for how to deal with changes that just catch you off guard? I know life is full of them but it always brings me back to a sadder place. Any advice would be so appreciated :)"

I am breathing in for 6 seconds and then out through my mouth with pursed lips and did it for 10-15 mins felt mildly better but went right back to feeling like I can’t breathe again 

Seriously tempted to call 111 for some piece of mind but there’s literally nothing they’ll be able to do for me. The only thing that has ever helped when I’m this bad is diazepam and no doctor is gonna prescribe me that on a whim.  

I feel so awful and fed up and emotional I just want to end it all. I’m just so desperate. Which is obviously making me feel worse."

 It's not easy being alone in your head when you're struggling with anxiety and/or depression and often times it can feel truly terrifying or hopeless at times.  We want to hear your thoughts, and want to make you feel less alone. I hope to be more active on this subreddit myself this year and try to help when I can from experience.

I hope this year brings a lot of positive change for those of us who still struggle. I'm sure many of us were able to reflect last year since we've been home more often during the pandemic.

2201,Anxiety,Dealing with oversharing and establishing boundaries,"I am a 24 (F) married to a 24 (M). My husband's family lives out of state so we don't spend a lot of time with them. Usually it's during the holidays or at Christmas. We found out we were expecting our first child last August. So his family came to stay with us for a week. His parents are divorced so his dad came alone for a week and then after his mom and sister came. 

Now since I was in my first trimester and dealing with alot of very negative emotions it was extremely hard for me. Me and my husband had just moved into our house so we hadn't even had time to decorate. Since his parents are divorced, they actually never speak to each other. They had a horrible divorce and my husband's younger sister suffers from alot of anxiety and has a history of depression too. My father in law when he was visiting us is a very stern individual. He's former military and has very high expectations for his son and also me too. I myself have really struggled with my mental health; I ended up leaving a really good job suddenly because of how bad my mental health was. My anxiety was just so high and I was really in a bad place. I'm also a pretty naturally quiet/introverted person. While my FIL was visiting he vented to me in private about how shitty his ex wife was; that she was lazy, didn't work, used mental illness as a excuse etc. (His ex wife suffers from anxiety/depression) He started blaming her for the reason why their daughter is struggling so bad(she has no job, doesn't want to go to college, just sits at home and stays up until 4 am, etc) She's 21 and just doesn't feel ready to move out or do anything else. I felt really uncomfortable during the whole conversation and due to my anxiety I started blabbing to my FIL about my entire story with being shy/struggling with anxiety and how his daughter just needs to get out there and get some type of job. I just felt so uncomfortable and wanted to show him I was worthy enough for his son. He also made a really hurtful comment and said to me ""Well at first I thought you were likemy ex wife, but you're nothing like her"" I know he meant well but that comment hurt me so badly. Because I already felt at the time like a lover for struggling to handle day things and not being able to really hold down a job at the time. I was in a very bad place mentally and I just did not need him to say that.  Afterwards I really regretted what I said and I was so thankful that he doesn't Have contact with his ex wife because I would be mortified if what I said got back to her. 

Similarly, when my MIL and her daughter were visiting I felt the need to start oversharing all about my mental health. I think because I just felt comfortable with them since they know what its like to go through it. And my husband who is so supportive and amazing through all my struggles he simply doesn't get it. Hes never dealt with anything like that. So he can't really understand fully what I struggle with. But I feel like I went again too far talking about my own really personal struggles. Notmally I would have never said those things. I also vented to both of them about my own parents and the issues I have with them. Which again I felt very guilty talking badly about my own parents to them. I just kept talking and couldn't stop. 

Now that I know this is a problem with me where I tend to overshare with my in laws I just have no idea how to prevent this from happening again. Our baby is due in late April and his family will be coming down to visit once the baby is born. I really do not want to say anything else I would regret and I also am just in general worried about what type of impression I gave them from previously. Even though me working on my mental health is a huge part of my daily life I really don't want it to be such a major focus when I'm around my in laws. But its so easy for someone to mention something and the conversation to easily result back to mental health. Especially when its around my MIL and her daughter, because when you have 3 people in a room who get really anxious its bound to happen that someone dods/says something about it. I dont want to come across as rude and that I can no longer talk to them about my personal life but I really need to establish boundaries and keep that to a minimum. Because its a huge damper on me getting better. It really affected me so badly from the last visit and actually made me fear ever seeing any of them again. I simply cannot go through that again, it was very mentally and emotionally draining for me."
2202,Anxiety,How do I stop stressing about football?,"It's my first and only year playing high school football. I'm in 12th grade and our season isn't until March 1st, but I'm already worrying. I actually had 8 preseason practices/skill sessions in the fall (without pads)and this is how each went I play receiver so I mostly did receiver drills except for the last day when I did DB stuff

First: Pretty damn bad had to get used to running routes

Second: Very Good

Third: Above Average

Fourth: Horrible on one drill, but pretty good on the rest

Fifth (First full team practice): Pretty ass but it was cold

Sixth: Pretty Good

Seventh: Also Pretty Good got first catch again defense

Eighth: I played DB but most of it was conditioning. In the 7 snaps I got at DB the QB never targeted me which I guess is good.

&amp;#x200B;

See how much I'm obsessing 😂 I just want to have fun but I'm worried I'll suck, and pre season practice is over. I won't start but I at least want to be a good practice player, and be a good option if someone gets hurt but I'm obsessively practicing by myself because it's too cold to go out for a while."

2204,Anxiety,"This year, I’m letting go &amp; I’m living","Hi everyone. First of all i hope this year brings you everything you deserve. I hope it brings you everything you’ve been stripped of in the past year or so. I hope you find that peace, happiness, and motivation that was so difficult to manifest as this past year brought new anxieties, sadness, and uncertainty into every waking moment of your life. 

This year, I’m letting go of that pain. Letting go of that anxiety. Letting go of that insecurity. This past year was without question the most devastating, challenging year I’ve faced on this earth. It taught me one thing. It’s that all the little things that normally caused me anxiety mean nothing in the grand scheme of life.

Halfway through 2020, i was on the verge of a complete meltdown. I was in shambles. Panic attacks, depression, anxiety that was so debilitating that showering and eating became a serious struggle. Although it was horrible at times, it allowed me to see the world through a different lens. My perspective changed as i hit rock bottom and had to decide where i wanted to go from there.

A few months back, a family member had a seizure and we found out they have 4 brain tumors. When i heard the news i was in a daze.. it felt like a dream. A nightmare really. At first, as anyone would, i took the news really hard. It was just so unfair to me. I cursed at God and prayed that i could somehow take this away from her. As awful as the situation was/is, i learned something truly valuable that i will carry with me moving forward. I decided that i will be the one that my family can lean on in tragedy. It’s no longer about me. It’s about others. My loved ones. The people that make my life worth living. 

This year I’m letting go. Letting go of unnecessary worry. Letting go of my past. Letting go of my insecurities. Letting go of the fear that has paralyzed me for far too long. I have one life, one family, one opportunity, and i refuse to waste another day worrying myself sick when there is so much life to live. So many people to serve and to love. So many chances to find happiness in the smallest and simplest of things. Life is tragic, but it’s also beautiful. I choose to seek out the beauty and to focus my attention on what truly matters. I hope you all can do the same, and i know we are all capable of wonderful things. Stay strong. Stay healthy. Most importantly, take care of yourself and your loved ones. They need you."
2205,Anxiety,Dealing with death anxiety,"I don’t wanna make this to long but from August to November of 2019 i went through a traumatic experience. Because of said experience i was going through some really bad death anxiety and overall panic attacks. Like everyday I thought was gonna be my last.

A good amount of time has passed since then and I’d say im about 90% passed the death anxiety. Like i can actually smoke weed again and not freak out and think im dying. I’ve slowly come to accepting that it will happen one day and i just gotta enjoy as much of life as i can. However this step is still kinda tough for me.

Whenever i get any kind of weird feeling anywhere in my body i still get that nagging voice saying “oh, its your time.” And i wanna say a big contribution to that is I’ve never really had big injuries in my life. So any little thing that doesn’t feel right i over react. Like I’ll get a head pain and think its a stroke. And i think this because well I’ve never had a stroke before so idk what that feels like physically. I can say the same thing for when i get chest pains, I’ll think they are the start of a heart attack.

Now before i go on, as far as i know im in 100% good health. So i really should have no reason to think these silly thoughts. I guess im just kinda rambling on. So just wondering if any of y’all are either going through what i am now or if you have in the past."
2206,Anxiety,Is this anxiety,"So I have a really big issue with time and if I ever wake up late or something I immediately start panicking and crying really hard, is this time anxiety? I also excessively plan things out and sometimes will plan my days off to the exact times of the errands I’m running."
2207,Anxiety,Has anyone been dealing with health anxiety for over 30 years and never actually had anything serious happen to them?,"Just out of curiosity!

I know worrying is in vain, but sometimes I feel like I’ll die young. I’m 26F and have been dealing with health anxiety for over 10 years now."
2208,Anxiety,NSFW red stool i’m absolutely spiraling over,"hi y’all. i just turned 19 yesterday (new years baby, yes) and have history of bad health anxiety, which lead me to having a panic attack stay at the hospital that i thought was a heart attack around this time last year. ever since then my anxiety has been absolutely shit

ANYWAYS i’m in my bed absolutely shaken after using the restroom. i’ve had an upset stomach all night which has just made me more anxious (my diet has not been good these past couple days. i’ve been dealing with a lot of depression due to the loss of my grandpa right before christmas) my stool was almost bright red and i know that i ate red spicy chips and some red velvet cake (made red with food colouring) and maybe some other red stuff like tomatoes etc but of course me being me i’m convinced it’s some sort of cancer.

i went to my mom telling her (i usually don’t obv lol but i’m terrified) and she said i’m probably fine. i wanna believe but my mind is telling me not to.

i usually wouldn’t post something like this but i’m having a really bad time mentally and just need someone to speak to. if you read all of this thank you so much :)"
2209,Anxiety,Exercise to control anxiety?,[removed]
2210,Anxiety,Dealing with bass and other neighbour noises,"Does anyone have an extremely anxious reaction to loud music/bass, stomping, doors slamming and other neighbor noises? It bother me SO BAD...especially the bass thud against my wall. I don't know how to deal with it.. I've tried CBT, smoking some weed to chill out, everything.. it gets me so worked up and makes me so angry and anxious. Almost like a PTSD feeling..... I don't know how to explain it. Anyone have solutions that have dealt with this?"
2211,Anxiety,Anxiety over a train card,"In the morning, I woke up to loud noises by my parents arguing, but not loud enough to make out most of their content. I did hear my father shouting, ""I am gonna kill you"" (which is the threat he makes when he rages at my mother unfortunately) and that got me nearly hyperventilating. 

Forwarding to 2-3 hours later, both of them went out, so I decided that I need a break from family drama and headed to the train station. I needed to get card A because it's the standard one and I lost mine. So, I went to the counter, and due to I dont know, anxiety from whatever happened before, I spoke softly (more like, lethargically) and feeling anxious, stumbled on my words, didn't say I wanted card A but I described it. Then the counter lady just looked at me, used her fingers to signal me the price (which was not the price of card A) so I was perplexed and just stood there like an idiot for a few seconds. She then said with an irritated voice ""What it is that you want? Card B?"" That shook me and I finally managed to say ""Card A"". She looked annoyed, told me there is no card A, then turned to her colleague, and then finally got me a card A. 

I don't know man. It's just a train card yet here I am doubting my ability to buy things... Now I am on the train, with no real destination in mind. I don't know if it's me, or that anyone under my circumstances would feel anxious. Sigh"
2212,Anxiety,I'm constantly think that there is someone in my house.,"A little while ago I thought that I heard breathing in my bedroom during online classes. At first I thought that it was my cat who's nose is cloged and today as I was grabbing my jacket from my closet I think that I heard someone whisper, ""hey"".
Im worried and I don't know what to do. Almost everyday I think that I here footsteps in my house. I don't know what to do anymore."
2213,Anxiety,Is a degree more important than my mental health?,Not completing med school at 28 is making my mental health deteriorate. I have physical manifestations of my anxiety. And for the past few months I’m experiencing suicide ideation. I’m not doing it actively. I come from a conservative family who don’t understand the complexities of mental health. I don’t want to die or give up on life. But the anxiety I go through everyday makes me drained out. This also makes me want to end everything so that I can be at peace. I don’t even get the chance to wallow in my sorrows because I live with my family and even the slightest change in my mood they want to know what is wrong with me. They are trying to be helpful here but their help is worsening my anxiety. I know it sounds unreasonable. I just need an escape.
2214,Anxiety,(rant) just needed to tel someone I guess,"Hi, I'm...not even really sure I should be posting this but, I need to say it. I need to say something. 

my names Jade, I'm 14f and currently it's 11:00 am, where I live. I.....I thought I was doing better I honestly did, but for the past two and a half hours, while my family sleeps, I've been pacing in the kitchen and clawing at my arms until the skin broke. givin that you might not see how it could have possibly been getting any better but it has, I've been four weeks without any cutting. but just now I just found out that my neighbor has COVID-19 and now  I.....I don't know what to do, my stupid brain just. won't. shut. up and I can't breathe, it doesn't matter how hard I try I just can't seem to get any air and it's only getting worse the longer I'm awake. I've worked really hard to avoid triggers and work them for quite some time now but right now I just.......I feel like I'm losing my mind, like my grip on reality is slowly fading and I can't get it back, I know this isn't any of your problems and I'll probably delete this account after posting but, I just need to say something, to tell someone."
2215,Anxiety,Toxic perfectionism,"If anybody has experienced this please let me know how you deal with it because I feel like it holds me back a lot. When I was younger in elementary/middle school I remember rewriting notes I took for class when I thought my handwriting was messy. Sometimes it got to the point where lots of my notebooks would have half the pages torn out because I didn't think my handwriting was neat enough. I love picking up artistic hobbies, like nail art, cross-stitching, etc. but whenever I finish making something, I end up hating it or finding more and more flaws the longer I look at it. This also happens with any selfies I take; if I look at any picture of myself for too long I end up deleting it off my social media because I found too many flaws in the photo. Sometimes it's not even anything worth agonizing over, like it'll be because there was a stray piece of hair in my face. I literally can't even play Animal Crossing without questioning the way I decorated my island LOL and wondering if I should redo it all.

This doesn't really impact my day to day life, but man I just wish I could relax and let shit go. I don’t want to feel stressed out over playing a game or doing something I enjoy. Like there are certain things I *won't* even try because I know I'll be overly critical of the outcome."
2216,Anxiety,Has anyone else ever had muscle cramps and weakness that was caused by chronic anxiety and possibly chronic shallow breathing?,"Background: years of chronic crippling anxiety. Well medicated - currently trintillex, lorazepam and.... uhhh can’t remember the name of the drug for heart palpitations.... 


I’ve had countless symptoms that are a result of anxiety - tingling fingers, bladder control problems, digestive issues you name it. I am well
Aware of the power of anxiety and it’s ability to mimic serious diseases. 


Lately My hands and feet specifically the tendons have been sore and crampy. Whenever I kneel on the floor my feet cramp up.... I’m a woodworker and my fingers and hands struggle to do what they used to do with ease. 

Short of jumping immediately to ALS or some other severe disease, has anyone else had these issues caused by anxiety? 

Worth noting I was “casually” diagnosed by a doctor once as chronically hyperventilating which can lead to an increase in lactic acid and cramps etc. But nothing conclusively that would cause issues like I’m having. 

I’m not getting ahead of myself and trying my best to address other posssible issues such as dehydration or magnesium deficiency but just thought I would consult this group as well. 

Cheers."
2217,Anxiety,I don’t know if this is anxiety or not.,I’m in 11th grade and I hate school because every time I’m in it I feel like everyone is watching me and everyone is talking about me and I feel like everyone hates me. I look normal I just feel like this all the time and another thing is when someone talks to me I can’t even think before I talk I just end up saying things because I don’t want them to think I’m weird and sometimes I get all hot and sweaty to just talking to someone. Most of the time I just put my head down in class so I don’t see anyone it helps me more. Another thing is I had some people tell me that they liked me and I literally couldn’t talk to them at all. Not to mention every time someone laughs I just feel like there laughing at me even tho there probably not. I just moved to a new school so it’s really hard to make new friends but my last school I had tons of friends. I can’t really talk to anyone unless they start talking to me first. I would love to have friends but I’m just to shy most of the time In my free time I just listen to music or play video games. I have a few friends at this school but I just feel like they don’t like me or like I’m not one of them. They don’t show any signs that they don’t like me I just feel like they don’t.
2218,Anxiety,The Usual Anxiety, I started out being so happy about moving away from a crappy place and enjoying myself but that doesn't last long because someone always causes me stress and anxiety. I mean I would like to have one day with relaxing and enjoying myself without someone ruining it. I work so damn hard in my life to save and work so damn hard being a mom I just want the anxiety to stop. I wish these certain people would just disappear and stop stressing me out. I'm not in the best health right now. I'm on a diet and exercise plan which helps a lot of my anxiety but I'm having other health issues that deal with something different. I just want no stress and no anxiety anymore each day of my life. I want the sources of it to just go away.
2219,Anxiety,Stopping sertaline,"Hi there quick backstory, I have been taking sertaline for about two years now I recently watched a Netflix documentary called heal and think it’s a good idea to stop taking this medication as I believe it’s a Band-Aid for a deep rooted cause that I need to figure out. has anyone else stop taking this medication and if so is there any advice you can give?"
2220,Anxiety,Anyone else find social media exhausting and anxiety provoking these days?,"All I see when I go on twitter is people arguing about trump or Biden. People arguing with each other about covid. People ripping on each other for everything they do. I like to go on twitter for sports, entertainment, and video game updates but 95% of the time I just see people at each other’s throats. It causes my anxiety to go wild."
2221,Anxiety,First time here.,"Just discovered this thread for the first time. The last week and a half has been hell for me and it does not help that I’m a hypochondriac.  Hopefully, this thread helps me combat this terrible feeling. I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. PS, does melatonin work?"
2222,Anxiety,Does anyone ever feel this way?,"I don’t want to go too into detail because I’m afraid if I tell people exactly what it is it will come true... but do you ever feel like when something you did changes someone else’s plans, something bad will happen to that person bc of your actions? Like if they have to go to one place instead of another because of something you did, some crazy event will happen at the new place that will harm the person? I can’t sleep over this right now."
2223,Anxiety,"DAE feel that their anxiety has made them emotionally stoic? I feel so guarded, even around loved ones. I don't think I trust them or myself to feel vulnerable","My brain is always working hard. When I see/hear something emotional, I don't have a natural reaction. My brain first says ""How should I react?"" It like I'm trying to solve a puzzle when intuition is the right answer.

I've noticed the only time I *feel* emotions deeply enough to express them is while watching movies. I think it's because I'm in someone else's story, and I get to feel their emotions vicariously. I can't cry in front of loved ones, but I'll ugly cry over a movie.

This has been going on since my early teenage years, and I'm now... Older. I just can't seem to get out of my head. Sometimes I think about mundane things such as how to walk or breathe or comb my hair. Did I always move my feet that way? Can other people see?

I feel frozen by indecision. Someone asks me what *do* I want for dinner? Well, I don't know, they both sound good. Do they want that too? Is that the right decision? Is there another decision I'm just not seeing?

It's all so exhausting."
2224,Anxiety,Should I start therapy or meds?,"I have really bad anxiety surrounding health/ medical issues, and some other things. Overall my general anxiety is pretty bad. I feel like it’s getting worse because I have so much time on my hands and I’m not sure what to do. 

I’m pretty sure the Dr has given my mom anxiety meds a looooooong time go, and only if I really need them I use them but that’s only been like twice, other than that I’ve never taken anything. I tried CBD but it wasn’t strong enough so it didn’t work, and I was really hoping that would help and just let me relax for once. My Dr also recommended therapy, and I went once but I didn’t like it so I never went back. 

I heard therapy helps a lot, so I’m not sure if I should go back. If I go I know it’s going to be very hard to open up about triggers and it honestly thinking about talking about certain causes might give me a panic attack lol. I’m going to college next year and i want to be able to have fun and not be a mess. Is therapy genuinely helpful? And will it allow me to live in peace for once?"
2225,Anxiety,Buspar after 2 years,"I have been taking Buspar for a little over 2 years now. Previously I’ve been on Zoloft and then Lexapro. With the previous ones I would start taking it, feel better for a little while and then have a major stressor that has me back in the doctors office asking for something better. Everything going on in the world has been a huge stressor. I’m contemplating seeing another doctor hoping there is something out there I can take to give me long term relieve. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this. Maybe just venting, maybe looking for some advice?"
2226,Anxiety,Anyone else SUPER clumsy?,"I ask because idk if it’s anxiety related. I tend to constantly spill and drop things, as well as forgetting where my phone is, or where I put something, etc. I feel like it’s because I’m in a rush due to anxiety! I was at Lowe’s yesterday and felt a panic attack potentially coming on due to drinking coffee that morning. I grabbed my paint they made for me, and I sat it on this shelf real quick so I could grab the other paint she was about to hand me. Of course, the first paint I sat down then tipped and spilled EVERYWHERE. I then make myself more anxious thinking I must have some kind of disease or a brain tumor, and that’s why I’m clumsy. Just wondering if anyone else with anxiety deals with this?!"
2227,Anxiety,"Starting an internship and getting a roommate in the next week, but I'm completely overwhelmed with anxiety about added interactions in my life and possibly coming into contact with COVID-19","So let me start with some background. I've been living alone for the past 4 months during my fall semester of college, and had a really tough time with my anxiety then. It was my first time living alone and I experienced a ton of panic attacks my first 2 weeks living there. Ended up getting on meds but decided to focus exclusively on school and try to avoid leaving my apartment as much as possible. I live in a pretty bad area for Covid as well, so that was another contributor to those panic attacks.

I agreed to allow a friend room with my starting tomorrow because she is going to grad school at the same university and i assumed having company would lessen my fears about being alone. I also managed to get an internship for Spring semester, which are both really positive things!

The problem here is that with roommates and an internship comes leaving the house more, and being around a person who also has a job, meaning both of us are more likely to be potentially exposing each other to Covid. I have been fortunate to be tested 3 times and they were all negative, and no one around me has had it. However with the risk going up, I can FEEL my anxiety starting to get bad again. I'm good about wearing masks when I go out and washing my hands and the whole nine yards, but im curious if anyone has any advice on making sure I remain safe and control my anxiety during this next semester. I know lots of people have been working right now."
2228,Anxiety,Ridiculous difficulty making decisions?,"Title. 

I struggle a lot with basic choices. I can make snap choices and I can manage even some bigger choices? But the small ones I can’t. I get worried I’ll make the wrong choice out of two mundane choices. Best explanation was the other day:

A friend asked me what I wanted for dinner and it sparked someone asking why I can’t choose. I said that I could make the wrong choice. Let’s say Chinese and Mexican. Do I want one or the other? Maybe. But what if the other person doesn’t? Or maybe the Chinese won’t be good for some reason or what if I say I want Chinese and then ten minutes later I change my mind? What if an extra minute of contemplation would change my decision? Blah blah blah. 

Basically, does anyone have advice on how to better make these decisions? I know it’s annoying. I hate it, personally. But I feel like knowing it’s annoying and knowing I need to make a decision finally only makes it worse."
2229,Anxiety,Convinced I now have no friends .,"My friend over the years have gotten bad.
All my closest friends left to move/ change school. We barely socialize anymore, they have new friends.

My current group is always filled with drama. There is 6 people in our group.
2 of the people in the group are the nicest ones, but not close. 
2 others talk behind everyone’s back,
1 is toxic , I’ve considered keeping distance from her and I will.
The 1 other confessed their feelings for me and is now mad I rejected them. And is texting less and ignores me sometimes.

I’m close with no one, I just needed to let this all out. I’m not very close with any of them, I can’t anymore.

I used to be happy in 4th grade, happy and had friends. Now I’m in 8th grade.

I’m trying to get back on my meds, I just want to find a new friend group sometimes I can’t anymore. All my classmates always talk behind each others backs.

I don’t know what to do. I stopped self harming, clean for 50 days but Im considering going back to feel actual feelings and happiness."
2230,Anxiety,Pandemic Anxiety,"I have been struggling with anxiety for years.  I take meds and it has helped a lot.  When the pandemic started I was out of work for 7 months (I’m a waitress). It didn’t bother me then even with my job and finances up in the air I could handle it.  The thing is my anxiety has always been associated with death.  I lost most of my family in a very short time period and I was never the same.  So now being back at work I’m being as safe as I can be.  I wear two masks, safety goggles, and wash my hands and sanitize everything.  It does give me anxiety that I have to be around people but I’ve got bills to pay.  Then tonight I go to work and I’m assigned to work in a private room for a 30 person wedding.  The guests were already not masks so I went around and told all of them that until they sat to eat the masks had to remain on.  This worked...until the open bar really kicked in.  No one cared anymore.  I can’t tell you how many drunk people without masks got right in my face to drunkenly whisper to get another round of shots.  I came home tonight walked my dog, and took a shower and broke down.  Like a full meltdown just sobbing in the shower.  I’ve taken an Ativan and am going to try to go to sleep.  I just needed to vent.  Thanks if you read this far."
2231,Anxiety,I can do it... just a couple more questions...,"When I tell her I didn’t hang out cuz I was too anxious should I ask if she accepts me for who I am? I kinda want to call her tomorrow...

Also should I clarify if not having a car is an issue? Or offer gas money? She said it wasn’t a wasn’t a problem a few months ago but I reminded her recently I don’t have one and she kind of repeated what I said.

Sorry for all the anxiety posts."
2232,Anxiety,I’m not the only one right?,"I’m curious to see if anyone else understands this. I think around when I got to middle school I got this way of thinking that anytime anyone I thought of as cool talked to me, they were doing it as a way to make fun of me. I felt that they genuinely wouldn’t talk to me otherwise. I’ve never felt like someone people wanted to talk to to. I’ve always felt like everyone’s last choice. My mindset has led me to seriously believe that no one genuinely likes me &amp; I’m not as important to them as they are to me. I feel like this has affected me when it comes to finding a relationship. I’m 24 years old &amp; I’ve never been in a relationship or even asked out. I think my way of being too afraid to ever ask people to hang out because I think they hate me has hurt me in a lot of ways. It keeps me from making friends &amp; being able to go out &amp; meet people &amp; possibly meet someone to go out with. I had a crush on a guy for a ridiculously long time &amp; I never told him because I felt that he didn’t really like me even though he was always really nice to me. But does anyone else have this mindset too where they feel that everyone secretly hates them?"
2233,Anxiety,Anyone else push people away as soon as you get close to them?,"Honestly, I've talked to a lot of people this year, but as soon as we started talking more or they started learning more things about me I couldn't take the pressure and basically started isolating myself again. I swear this happens every time I meet someone new, it starts off great for a few days and then I start getting really stressed about what I'm saying. It's almost like I don't think I'm funny or interesting enough for them, so it just takes too much mental energy to talk to them at all. I withdraw because it's easier. This is absolutely wrecking my social life, anyone else have similar experiences?"
2234,Anxiety,Feeding the machine,I know this is an anxiety thread but I battle both anxiety and depression. My depression makes me anxious when I see messes. Yet my depression makes me not want to do a damn thing but sit on my couch and play overwatch all fucking day. It annoys my fiancée but I just can’t bring myself to do anything else. I haven’t cooked in maybe 3 weeks and I have a couple of laundry loads to do. The laundry room in our building has been out and we needed to do some of it so It went to a laundry mat. But the house was still a mess. I couldn’t see my kitchen table or really my living room floor. It all made me so anxious and all I wanted to do was make it go away and sit and do nothing. So that’s what I did. Until I finally got off my ass and made myself clean. Now the anxious times are behind me somewhat and I feel like I can actually breath again. I hate this having both at the same time at times but it happens and I have to make the best of it. Hope everyone has a happy Sunday.
2235,Anxiety,My trust for society has been shattered,"Ever since the pandemic happened, my trust for a lot of things has vanished. I think everyone is either lying to me to keep me sedated or is trying to brainwash me into some sort of emotionless NPC blob state. I don't trust the president (Biden or Trump), the government (state or federal), my governor, my college president, or even my professors sometimes. Basically anyone in authority. I hate commercials and advertisements because I feel like they're subliminally trying to brainwash me. I especially don't trust any major news outlets, local news outlets, or any articles on the internet, because I think they're trying to push a NWO agenda on me too. 

It doesn't bother me all the time of course, just kind of sucks that I now have this big ""me vs the world"" feeling now."
2236,Anxiety,Medicated for over a year keep getting anxious,"I’ve been medicated on anti depressants for my anxiety for nearly two years now. I’m on the highest dose of this medication. 

I’ve seen a psych but she was condescending, didn’t actually listen to me and then said if I still can’t stop the anxiety or sleep (she told me to think of nothing....!!! And I don’t know how to do that!!) then we should look at medication. Needless to say I did not go back. 

Part of my anxiety prevents me from sleeping or sleeping well. 

I have since turned to self medicating to be able to sleep through the night. 

Now I’m finding my anxiety to surface again. An example was this morning while I was having breakfast with my partner. 

I’m just so sick and tired of feeling anxious and worrying. 

Thanks for coming to my vent."
2237,Anxiety,Fear of new experiences/failure,"Longtime lurker, first time poster here. Basically I’m starting my first “real” job in the next couple of days and the anxiety it’s causing me is consuming my life. I guess I’m just here looking for any advice or support. I graduated from college in May with a BA in Economics and accepted an offer with a large accounting firm (although my role will be in HR consulting, nothing to do with accounting). While I’m INCREDIBLY grateful to have this opportunity at a time when so many people are struggling economically, I’m feeling a terror-like anxiety at the thought of starting this job. What if I don’t know how to do something? What if I fuck something up? What if everyone else knows stuff or took classes that I didn’t take and I’m completely unprepared? I’m feeling stupid for even posting this, I’m sure everyone else has these worries and just sucks it up and gets through it alright but I’m just really scared and don’t want to burden anyone in my life with my crazy “what-ifs”. Any advice would be greatly appreciated and thanks for reading if you got this far!"
2238,Anxiety,Anxiety related heart issue or?,"Gone to the ER with chest pain that was bad enough for me to stop and call 911

Pretty much. Was at home had some CBD. out of nowhere my chest felt like someone punching my heart and it’s beating hard and fast and painful and I got up and was worse. Got into t car and felt even worse that I almost done blacked out and got someone to help me and called 911. ER did these tests and discharged me. I have bad bad bad Anxiety and this felt like something new. I have a cardiologist who did every test and came fine and I complained and they did more and ran out of what to do and this was about 2 years ago. I’m just surprised they let me go. I’m scared now

2239,Anxiety,Do you ever wonder where this came from?,I often try to go back and find the source of what sparked my severe anxiety issues. Even as a child I remember being so freaked out by minuscule things. In the first grade my friend got sick and I remember standing in the hallway like almost dissociating because of how freaked out I was. I guess sometimes we’re just born this way.
2240,Anxiety,What’s wrong with me? Pls help,"I don’t know if it’s ADD, depression, anxiety, or a combination of all 3 but my mental health has been bad for a little over a year (again). I got on an SSRI recently and although it’s kinda helped with my anxiety, my depression almost seems to be worse (don’t worry, I’m going to speak to my doctor about this). What really concerns me and bums me out is the fact that I can’t accomplish anything. I over-think everything so much that I end up doing nothing. I wake up instantly feeling overwhelmed/overstimulated and usually go straight on my phone. Constantly searching things as I’m constantly thinking, never being able to finish reading certain articles and posts as I’ve started thinking about something else, constantly having so many tabs open. Is this normal? A lot of times I feel so overwhelmed I end up just sitting on the couch and watch Netflix. How do I become more productive? I like the idea of doing more and I used to do more! Used to always go out with friends/by myself to restaurants, concerts, on hikes/camping trips  but it’s been so hard lately. I stopped drinking about two years ago and noticed I’m so much more introverted sober. Or maybe I’ve realized I’m more depressed? Anyway, I always tell myself at night that tomorrow will be different; I even make a to-list in my notes app but it never gets started.. or at least finished.I’m I that weak minded? Or lazy? Does anyone else feel this way or is there something seriously wrong with me? I’m so embarrassed that I’ve become this way. For those who are more self disciplined and have more of a structured schedule, how do you do it? What advice do you have for me?"

I work in a clinic that does procedures occasionally and when I’m asked to assist in them I get so anxious that I throw up. The PA I work with prescribed me Zofran to take before procedures to help the issue. I also get EXTREMELY nauseous when going into social settings, crowds, and basically whenever I have to go anywhere alone. Does anyone else experience this? If so what are coping methods you use!"

2245,Anxiety,How to start reassuring and validating myself,"So I’ll keep this short n sweet; I recently came to a realization that in my relationship, whether it comes to every argument or disagreement with my partner, I always go to my brothers and friends to vent. But, it isn’t ONLY venting; it’s seeking approval or validation for how I’m feeling. And from there, based on their opinions, what I should do next.

&gt; recent example is my partner has some toxic traits that made being in the relationship tough for me, I figured she knew how bad they were and just kinda was ignoring them, so I went to break up with her. Turns out she didn’t know how bad it truly was since I never explicitly had a TALK talk about them, and she agreed to seek help to better herself and we can try and see if we can make our relationship work.

One brother sounded a bit distasteful with my choice to give her a chance (she reminds him of his toxic ex due to some traits, but she IS NOT HIS EX as a person) one was kinda eh but understood, and one straight up said “dude I don’t give a fuck about your relationship. You do what you think is right because I assure you I’m not always thinking about your relationship, I got my own stuff to worry about to. Just give it a shot, see how it goes, and that’s it.” Brother #2 (Eh Brother) basically agreed with him when I told him his reaction and Distateful Brother I didn’t touch back with. One friend said he wishes us luck and it’s within my right to give another chance and another basically said “I give it two months and I’m not kidding. You made a mistake imo”

&gt;another example is my two sister in laws and all my brothers think my partner is being stubborn for not doing X or Y to make up with my mom over some tension between them (long story short: my mom talked bad about my partner to me, I didn’t want my partner coming over while my mom felt this way and acting fake, so I told her). And it feels like everyone around me was just like “fuck your partner” and in a way made me feel like that’s how I should feel too because we are all super family oriented while she isn’t. In the end, the situation sounds like it’ll at least come to a civil talk sometime soon. Resolution? Who knows, but it’s the talk that matters.

Overall, the main reason I’ve been feeling so conflicted after the make-up is because I felt like not breaking up was a mistake. But why? My rational side is because I don’t want to waste her time and in the end hurt her even more if this doesn’t work out. I want her to be okay. She knows the risks just as well as me so I’m kinda slowly passing these sad and negative feelings now

My anxiety-side says why? Because everyone around me was distasteful of her? Because some people acted as if I made a mistake? I realized for almost my whole life..I sought their approval for the way I acted in important times of crisis; arguments with my mom, gf, etc. I sought their validation for my feelings and actions and if they disagreed, I second guessed myself and my anxiety and overthinking skyrocketed.

For anyone who has dealt with the same, how did you get past this? I came to the realization and am soon seeking therapy for anxiety in general, but ik the road to fully being okay with this may be a long one"

2248,Anxiety,Highly recommend headspace guide to meditation on Netflix,"Meditation is one of those things I've always been interested in to help my anxiety, but never quite knee how to do my toes in afraid I'd fuck it all up.   I quite like the first few episodes I've seen so far!"
2249,Anxiety,Therapy Groupchat,"Anyone interested in a ""Anxiety Support Group"" via text? It's a way for different people with the same disorder and similar symptoms to find a safe place to vent and talk about what's happening. Just want a nice friendly group of people to eventually become friends with. PM if interested!"
2250,Anxiety,Shaking sucks,"I have noticed for awhile now since I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety that I will shake my legs the moment I begin to eat. Sometimes when it happens and my husband will tell me to stop/relax. I guess it’s become natural to me that I overlook it but I still hate it. It’s like I feel nervous but happy when I eat, like my brain gets confused. Can anyone relate?"
2251,Anxiety,health anxiety and paranoia,"Hi! I’m not usually the one to post my personal issues online but some recent events led me to posting on here. 

I’ve always had horrible health anxiety, if get a singular pain it sends me into a panic thinking I’m having a heart attack, stroke, or anything deadly. I’ve tried changing how I think about death and I’ve tried a few tactics to help calm my anxiety but I don’t know how much longer I can take having 3-6 anxiety attacks a day. to add onto that I’ve been extremely paranoid lately, constantly scanning rooms before I enter them, heightened hearing, I’m set into fight or flight mode very easily, and I’ve been feeling like someone is watching me which has led me to sleep with my light on every night for a month. I’m thinking it’s possible that it has to do with some trauma i experienced in the past. Anyways, I’d appreciate anything at this point. I’m wondering if anyone has experienced things like this and even better how did they learn to cope or even get rid of the anxiety."
2252,Anxiety,Just started fluoxetine (Prozac) and I'm wondering what to expect,"I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder a couple of years ago, worked on my mental health on my own for some time before starting regular therapy in Jan 2020, and I've recently been prescribed meds for anxiety.

For context: I have always been a very high-functioning person, borderline overachiever despite my anxiety, but 2020 really got the best of me. In the past few months, I've stopped going the extra mile for work, I struggle to connect with the things I was once passionate about. I feel like I'm trapped in my mind with anxious, negative thoughts.

My therapist and psychiatrist say the meds are necessary right now and I've gotten started on fluoxetine (Prozac, known as Prodep where I live) on the new year. I would love to know your experiences with the meds, did it help? Were there side effects? Did you see improvements?"
2253,Anxiety,Dating with anxiety,"I (19M) have severe social anxiety and it is really affecting my dating life, I've never had anything close to a relationship and I feel a huge need  to experience dating and relationship. 


But for me, communicating with anyone is extremely difficult, I'm really awkward and rude without wanting too (how I cope with the anxiety ig) and it's even more difficult when I'm trying to talk to someone I'm interested in, I mean nearly impossible, and even if the girls is interested and giving me signal I won't even understand them and if I do, I will just get frozen. 

So alchool and drug kinda help me talk to girl but I know it's not the best way to cope. But I feel like it's the only way.

So I've never asked a girl out before in fear of being rejected, I need advice. (I have diagnosed severe social anxiety and taking meds for it but still really affecting me on a daily basis)"
2254,Anxiety,I posted last year that I was anxious to get a new debit card,"I got one but since then it's been non stop trouble with it. I got it because I did not want to rely on Mum to get things for me online. I had one before but when I tried to use it to sign up with Paypal I kept getting errors. When I tried to discuss it with the bank, I had a panic attack and stormed out. Then I couldn't use the card and it expired.
Last year I thought I'd push myself to get a new one and hopefully I won't have the same trouble with it. Things went ok with ordering things online but around November last year I was trying to type in the number to make an order on Ebay, I kept getting errors. I argued with the bank on the phone over it paranoid that my card had been hacked into they assured me nothing had happened. Because of the errors I had to get a new card. Get the new card, things are OK again, card works.
Then tonight I get an email from the post office that a 'parcel from Tony is being prepared'. I did not order anything from Tony. The last few times I used the card online were last weekend via 3 clothing stores none of which had the name 'Tony'. Now again I am sick to the stomach and paranoid that my card is being hacked into and my money is gone. I tried calling the bank and they will not answer (it's Sunday night over here). Now I probably won't sleep tonight. Last time I called them over paranoia of being hacked I had an all mighty screaming and crying meltdown with the lady on the phone because of my anxiety, I don't want that to happen again. 

I try to push myself and to take risks as I keep being told to do. 'You'll never know if you don't try' I get told over and over again. They always backfire, always. Something as small as putting myself out there, or having hobbies, or 'trying' just ends in shit."
2255,Anxiety,Chest pain without panic attack symptoms?,"New user here. Earlier today, I had a sudden sharp pain in my left chest (heart) area, while I was sitting on my bed. Had to breathe shallow breaths to avoid pain from deep breaths. Lasted for 13-14 minutes, though I still feel some residual sensation. I am a pretty anxious person, and my work has been particularly stressful recently. I've been looking into psychiatric help for the past week or two, but now I'm even more motivated to do so.

I hope I can make more sense of this here. I've never had this type of problem before. Not sure if it's related to anxiety or anything mental. Took blood pressure 5+ minutes after it stopped, results were fine. I am 24 years old, normal weight, and do not have a history of heart problems."
2256,Anxiety,why do I feel that I’ll be bullied over the music I listen to?,"Should I be ashamed of the music I listen to simply because of my gender?

2260,Anxiety,It's 5:00 am. My day is starting whether I like it or not.,"My excuses are usually bullshit like, ""The early bird gets the worm!"" when prompted why I wake up so early.

Do I lay there wishing for that last few minutes of respite before starting a day of worry or do I get up and start a different kind of worrying.

I'm up, as usual."
2261,Anxiety,Should I?,"I just applied for a job today and have an interview on Tuesday. Catch is I’ve worked for the company before, I left three years ago due to anxiety and stress and to focus on school.

2262,Anxiety,I locked myself in my room,"I don't know if it's anxiety causing this, but when I go to leave the room I feel this intense feeling or paranoia and fear. When one of the caretakers came by to check on me, I could barely to get any words out. I find myself just staring at my laptop, pacing, and rocking on my heels. I don't know why I'm so nervous and sad, I'm pretty sure everything is perfectly okay. I'm just confused."

I really think something is actually physically wrong with me. I’ve had panic attacks and anxiety my whole life but I’ve  never experienced feeling this confused and hopeless. I was doing fine for weeks only feeling this way for part of the day and just gradually got worse and now it’s not going away and I’m really scared which is causing me to panic more.

Just a month ago I was anxious due to heath issues but feeling like myself. Physical symptoms worry me but I can deal with them but mental symptoms I can’t handle. Now I feel like I’m losing myself totally, I don’t understand what is happening to me and I don’t really want to be alone. This is the worst and most alone I have ever felt."
2265,Anxiety,can anxiety attacks be calm?,"i'm like anxious most of the time but sometimes i have this sudden wave of more severe(?) anxiety where my chest tightens, my heart beats faster, and thoughts just keep rushing in. words cannot explain it actually :(( but like i'm calm on the outside, i don't cry, i don't panic like the one's in the movies. it's just what is happening inside."
2266,Anxiety,friend got me a stim toy for Xmas and I love it,"I'm a massive fidgeter with my anxiety, I used to have a lanyard at school and I'd snap the card in and out constantly (much to the annoyance of everyone around me). Since entering the working world I've struggled to find something to replicate it. Ive had a fidget dice before but lost it a while ago, and it was quite loud for the workplace (you could really hear every click - great for me, terrible for colleagues). I've been biting my nails recently whcih is an old habit but I need something to do with my hands. My current job is front line and very much covid facing so this is now quite a dangerous habit to have. 

So, my best friend bought me a pea pod for Christmas that you can pop the peas out of, and I've attached it to my phone case. I'm at my first day at work since I got it and it's the best thing ever :) It's such a good stress reliever and keeps my brain focussed when my hands are occupied.

2268,Anxiety,Heart palpitations can’t sleep,"I’m honestly not sure if this is Anxiety related or not but did some googling and saw that lots of ppl that share similar symptoms relate it to Anxiety. Anyway for the last around two or three weeks I have been suffering from slight chest pain and palpitations, especially while I sleep. I was getting rather concerned so I ended up going to the emergency room one day. They did blood test ran blood pressure and heart rate, ECG scan and everything came back normal besides palpitations. Ever since I have been having a hard time sleeping and am starting to wonder if this is or isn’t something related to Anxiety. I’ve never really felt like a person that suffered from Anxiety but with current events and my graduation coming soon I’m not sure if the pressure is causing this. I’m curious if anyone has some advice, it is currently 3 am and I don’t see myself sleeping anytime soon"

I have been up since about 3 and I can’t sleep. I am so exhausted. I have so much anxiety, but it is making me filled with maybe adrenaline or something? I don’t know, but I’m antsy.

2271,Anxiety,THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANXIETY AND SELF SABOTAGING,"Hey guys I wanna talk about what I've learned this past years from people who are dealing with anxiety so their Anxiety patterns has a reason which most of the time is to block them or sabotage them from reaching a certain goals because unconsciously they don't feel comfortable in a certain situations, I think if you guys wanna cure your anxiety and other confident issues you're dealing with you have to do some shadow work on yourselves and discovering your hidden resistance that keep holding you back no matter how you try to step outside and achieving your Dreams. 

If you wanna know more about this you can chat me :)"
2272,Anxiety,Sending love ❤️,"I just had a talk with my sister about mental illness and was sitting on Reddit thinking about all of the people on here (including myself) with anxiety and my heart was touched. 

You guys are so strong to keep striving every day even when you’re mind and body are fighting against you in even the simplest of tasks. Even when you’re feeling overwhelmed and concerned with how you will move forward. What’s going on with you isn’t fair and it stinks to know that others can simply live their lives much more easily than we can, but you’re here and you’re trying. 

Just know that some random girl at four in the morning with tears in her eyes is thinking of you and loves you. I know this might not mean anything, but I just wanted to share. Keep going, keep trying. It might not be as easy for us, but we can still accomplish anything that anyone else does. Go to therapy, work out, eat healthy, meditate, pray, do whatever you can to help. You got this. ❤️"
2273,Anxiety,I forgot how damn soothing Minecraft is. First time I felt this calm in like 3 years,I recommend playing Minecraft with the sound up because the music in the background is really nice. Oh and turn on creative mode. I think I might try using Minecraft again to help me not be constantly worrying about my future or feeling guilty about everything. I recommend you at least try it if you can.
2274,Anxiety,"Frustrated, need to vent a little","So, to make this short, I've been battling with (almost) crippling health anxiety for over 4 years now. I got diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2016, got treated (surgery was enough, so no chemo nor radiation) and been a complete wreck after that. For some reason, I'm constantly fearing my heart will just stop. I think a fear of cancer would make a little more sense in my position, but oh well. I'm 38 now and know full well, that every year my chances of getting sometimes serious only rises.

I often wake up in the middle of the night feeling I'm about to die. Like seriously. It's a weird ass feeling. Sometimes I scream as I wake up. I don't think there's an hour in the day when I'm not thinking about death. If I feel just a slight discomfort in my body, it's cancer, blood cot, pulmonary embolism, heart attack, etc. You name it and I've been certain that I've had it in one point. Since I have heartburn/acid reflux/chest pains quite often, it's usually the heart attack. Sometimes I think I'm not getting enough oxygen or that there's something in my throat blocking the airways or something.

Of course I've had my share of full blown panic attacks too, but for whatever reason there hasn't been one in a couple of years. It's just the constant lingering feeling of doom that really takes it toll on me. Life is not particularly enjoyable like this and to add insult to injury, I've had to let go of things like coffee and many foods since all this began. I can't enjoy the little things in life, since they seem to worsen my anxiety.

Yesterday I just chilled, went for a long brisk walk, had a sauna session and had sex with my wife. Terrible, right? Of course after all that I had the worst night in a while and feeling super anxious for at least today, quite possibly the next few days.

Anxiety, or whatever the hell I have, just sucks man."
2275,Anxiety,Meds against anxiety,"Hey the schools in germany open in 2 weeks and my  17 year old hardly depressed ass gets a anxiety attack even thinking about going to school again and interact with the teachers or students.
My question is : Are there any Meds you can get as a minor without your Parents or a doctors consent?

My suicide date is in April 2022 and I dont think I can even survive that long without serious Meds.

2276,Anxiety,The combination of mental illness and education,"The combination of mental illness and education is really not it. Before the christmas break I was not doing well and I was waiting until the break to catch up to my assigments. I thought everything would go smoothly, because now I had two weeks to do everything I hadn't yet finished before.
Then boom. Mental illness. That piss face really messes everything up. Now I have just 1 day to complete the assignments, and I had to select the most critical ones, which means that I'm behind on school work AGAIN. Man I'm tired. I don't know how I'm gonna graduate lol because I have my exams this year and so far it has not been going well. :')
If this keeps up it won't end well either. 
And for some reason everytime I need to start an assignment I get scared? And I must admit that I'm lazy too, but there's this other feeling, greater than laziness, that just holds me back or something? Everytime I think about school or look at the books on my desk I get scared or something. And this really doesn't mix well with trying to get motivation to do the assigments. So yea, do y'all have any takes on this? I would love to hear your experiences and possibly some tips you have."
2277,Anxiety,Ok,Do anyone have physical symptoms of anxiety like Twitching in the thumb by the pulse or like numb or tingling different parts of the body or anything because i do and its not from my meds or i know i am healthy because i went the ER recently last year in the spam of 3 months of 5 or 6 time's because i keep having heart palpitations and i feel like i was dying at that time i feel like i was going crazy but right now I am recovering from anxiety slowly and I'm having some bumps in the road from my recovery and i know some coping skills works for other people and not for the same thing's will work for other people but what can i do to help to cope with anxiety.  Please and thank you
2278,Anxiety,Has anyone successfully treated childhood onset anxiety? What worked for you?,"My anxiety goes back as long as I can remember. When I was 27 and learned the symptoms of anxiety, I realized that I had been having anxiety all my life. Having the nurse dismiss my complaints of “my heart hurting.” The outbursts that ostracized me from classmates and made teachers hate me. The trips to the principals office, the calls home, the school telling my mom that she needed to take me to a doctor. My mom took me out of school for the day for the “doctor’s appt” but her telling me that I’m fine and didn’t need to go. I have no idea if there was ever an appt.

My anxiety has never really been treated. I’m super aversive to meds; partly ingrained stigma, anxiety about meds, and a genuine belief that other treatments are more effective and less harmful (CBD, diet, exercise). There’s also the fact that I think I’m autistic. I’ve always thought I was different and when my kids had sensory issues, rigidity, language and social delays, I wasn’t concerned because I was and still am the exact same way.

I’ve started buspirone and I’m spiraling. None of my usual methods are helping calm my anxiety. I’m constantly on the verge of tears and can’t sleep. I feel like my anxiety is near constant. I’m trying the apps, the journaling, etc. There’s no relief and no sleep. I thought about driving myself to the hospital. I’ve called the mental health line twice today (a complete joke, they kicked me off the phone at the 30 min mark).

At this point, I’m wondering if there’s a difference in treating adult onset vs childhood onset anxiety. Or am I just irretrievably broken and that’s why nothing is helping. I just want to fix myself and see what life is like without anxiety.

And...now I’m crying again. Sitting in the car at 4 am so I don’t wake anyone."
2279,Anxiety,Manual breathing and swallowing - can’t sleep at all. Please help!,"23M. Ever since 2 days ago I’ve started manually noticing my swallowing. I have to swallow my saliva every few seconds. Also, less frequently, This goes on throughout the day. 

When I lay in bed, ever since 2 days ago, I have to manually breathe in and out. It felt like my automatic breathing and swallowing stopped. In addition, whenever I feel there is a buildup of saliva in my mouth when laying in bed, I have to swallow it. It is absolutely awful. Because of my manual breathing and swallowing, I cannot fall asleep. I’ve spent 2 nights, going to bed at 11 PM and just laying there for 8 hours until the morning without ever falling asleep once because of the manual breathing the need to and swallow my saliva in bed. I have not fallen asleep in 2 days because of this. And I’m super sleep deprived. 

How do I stop manually swallowing my saliva and manually breathing when I’m trying to sleep? This is absolutely awful. I’ve never had to just lay in bed because of manual swallowing and breathing for the entire night without being able to sleep. I just want to be able to sleep again, especially because I have work.

2281,Anxiety,Superstitious fear of writing out words,"Hi guys,

I'm not sure that this is an OCD trait or not which is why I am posting here. For reference: I have GAD and have just started Zoloft.

One of my weird idiosyncrasies (which thankfully nobody knows about!) is that I will avoid typing out certain words.

For instance: I'm currently creating a Google Drive folder in which I plan on adding a bunch of mental health resources.

So I'm creating my subfolders 'Anxiety,' 'ADHD,' 'OCD,' — but then when it comes to depression I can't quite bring myself to write it out. So instead I create a folder called 'Dep' which will be my secret shorthand.

Why do I do this? I have no idea! It's like to avoid giving power to something I'm scared of or ashamed about I guess. I do the same thing about the current virus engulfing the world, even in conversation. I call it ""the pandemic.""

Anybody have something simillar?"
2282,Anxiety,I don’t know what’s wrong,"I have depression and anxiety but I recently “graduated” therapy. I was in therapy for a year and a half and we agreed that all my goals had been accomplished so we terminated. It felt amazing. Then the very next day I had a massive panic attack. I talked to some peers and called it up to the fear of not having my therapist to talk to anymore. I’ve become very aware and sensitive to the sounds around me, specifically any sounds emanating from my dogs mouths. It is as though the sounds good to the core and makes me want to throw up. I have never really noticed it before except the slight irritation of the sounds of licking. More sounds have been bugging me and I don’t know what is going on. My sleep is also being affected. Does anyone have similar experiences?"
2283,Anxiety,Why buspirone gets me apathy?,"and how can i get it apathy, cuz i have tons of work and i can't work without better mood"
2284,Anxiety,Anybody else ride the caffeine / alcohol train prior to starting medication?,"I'm currently writing up some notes for my psychiatrist appointment tomorrow.

One of the issues that drew me to treatment was the fact that I needed to greatly cut back on the amount of alcohol I was drinking. And, in fact, to cut it down to a bear minimum. I was diagnosed with gastritis after a surgery a year ago (unrelated to alcohol!) and, to keep it in remission, I don't have much leeway. 

The problem was that I was drinking copious amounts of coffee by day in order to summon up the motivation to work. And in order to stay focused on the task(s) at hand. 

I'm sorry to say that I was stuck on the caffeine:alcohol seesaw for many years. By day, I would drink about 5 to 6 cups of coffee depending on my workload. By night I would have a beer or two in order to come down from the physical anxiety that the coffee produced and get to sleep. My alcohol consumption was never crazy but ... it became clear that even 1-2 beers a few nights a week was too much for my gastritis.

After several attempts, I concluded that there was no way that I was going to be able to figure this out on my own. If I cut out coffee, I simply couldn't focus on anything or get anything done (which in turn made me stressed out and anxious). If I cut out the alcohol, I would have severe insomnia and anxiety. There was nothing to dampen it down.

At one stage I even looked into taking up weed to replace the alcohol. But I hate weed and have bronchitis. And my lungs couldn't even handle vaping!

This madness persisted for 5 years or so. Until my surgery it sort of worked. But obviously this crazy self medication duo was unsustainable from the get-go.

I'm now trying to figure out what's causing what. I was initially diagnosed with ADHD but my ADHD doc now things I have primary anxiety and secondary focus issues. Or possibly both. But he wants me to treat the anxiety before resuming treatment.

Sharing this in case anybody else has been on the same self-medication ""combo."" I reckon it has to be relatively common.  If you were on it and managed to get off thanks to proper treatment, please share what worked for you."
2285,Anxiety,Intense anxiety first thing in the morning,"I have had anxiety for years but it became super intense after I had my daughter 4 years ago.  A lot of nights, I have what I call ""anxiety dreams"" which is basically a panic attack in dream form, a bunch of situations that make me anxious just playing out in my head all night. When I wake up in the morning, I feel so much anxiety that my chest has a lot of pressure on it and it makes me uncomfortable. I can't stop thinking about everything I have to do even if it's menial shit, like going to pick up my daughter or cleaning or something. Stuff that shouldn't make me anxious. Has anyone ever experienced this? It puts both me an my husband on edge and now we fight a lot in the mornings and I hate waking up like that.

So I’ve made a ton of progress in my life dealing with worries and ruminations etc. The problem is my body just cannot seem to get the message! I will often spend most of the day feeling intense physical pressure, mostly in my neck and shoulders and also some headache/heat type feeling. Even when I am not particularly worried about anything, I can feel like there are bricks loaded up on my shoulders. I am interested in all tips, pharmaceutical and non. I am planning to try progressive muscle relaxation more regularly. I meditate but it hasn’t changed this (works better for thoughts and worries). Anyone found any interesting ways to relieve constant physical anxiety even when your brain knows you’re okay? Thank you!"
2287,Anxiety,Anxiety physical symptom?,"I've had almost every physical symptom caused by anxiety - Chest pain, shaking, sweats, sore throat, you name it.... I've been having a full blown anxiety attack and my stress is over the top lately. The entire day has been EXTREMELY stressful. I'm now experiencing my inner ear is heating up. It's weird to explain it, but it feels like heat waves inside my inner let year. Does this happen to anyone else?? I'm kinda freaking out."
2288,Anxiety,My anxiety medication is actually working. Wow...what a difference. Realizing how bad my anxiety was when I found something that helps,"I have a lovely Psychiatric Mental Health Nurse Practitioner that has given me something for anxiety.  It has all been too much lately and the anxiety was taking over every single moment of my days.  Now, I can breathe.

Anybody else experience realizations of how bad your anxiety truly ~~was~~ is after finding something that helps? I didn't realize how I hold myself and my body so tightly and rigidly until the medication calmed my nerves.  I hadn't realized how much of my day is truly consumed with anxious thoughts.  Without this medication I would not have realized I am constantly scanning my surroundings for threats, and by doing so I am missing out on what is in front of me.  I am so thankful for these couple days of peace and being.  Here's hoping it keeps doing its job."
2289,Anxiety,I hate my anxiety,I have always had really bad social anxiety that makes it difficult to open up to new people but when I do start to get comfortable being around them I for some reason can’t seem to shut up and end up saying something that causes them to not want to be around me as much. Why???😭

2291,Anxiety,-_- I hate how my anxiety keeps centering on my relationship,"I don't know...things are great, we have a great time together, he says he loves me...
-_- so why do I keep getting these paranoid thoughts and second guessing things? ...
My brain just seems to want to ruin things for me."
2292,Anxiety,"just afraid of a few things, and would like comfort","for the past few weeks, I've been remembering certain situations. certain situations I shouldn't have done. It's been pestering me, and I'd like for it stop. Except, it can't. It would be great for me to no longer have these regrets. however like I said, that isn't quite possible.

as a young child, I had stupidly large access to the internet and technology. I'd comment on particular apps, and websites with little to no self-awareness. I'm afraid that one day, these circumstances may later interfere with my daily life in the future. I wouldn't go to specifics about what they said, but I could admit that they were embarrassing. They were quite hurtful, and let's say, edgy. These were comments I could never say, and comments that I would persecute myself constantly if they ever came out of my out mouth today. With the sort of conditions you see now, doxxing and whatnot is rather prevalent or at least is more often than not discussed about. I have a fear that my information will be revealed, and that connections to the accounts I previously made will link to who I am currently.   The fact that I don't have access to them is stressing. This prevents me from going further with any of my passions, and making friendships with the worry that what I've done in the past will ultimately ruin them otherwise.

While I do understand that I've changed, that I am a significantly different person that I am years ago, and that I am not at all an influential individual with a large following, it continues to bother me. Since this issue still risks a lot if it does happen, even after acknowledging the ways I have improved. I've just been extremely paranoid, and I don't know if I'll ever catch a break. I'd like some reassurance and possibly advice, thank you."
2293,Anxiety,Best way to stop hyperventilating?,"Hi, I have a huge problem with hyperventilating. Now whenever I get slightly anxious I start having a shudder or double breath. I also can’t swallow which makes me hyperventilate more. What is the best solution for this? Please help. Thank you."
2294,Anxiety,Does anyone have any advice for dealing with false memories?,"If you suffer from the anxiety that produces obsessive thoughts, leading to false memories, then you know what I’m dealing with. It’s hard to know you didn’t do it, even me saying it was a false memory isn’t confirmation that I believe it is false, even though it’s weird because it seems like I’m self aware? You know what I mean?

It’s obsession. I’m trying to go over and work through details from things that happened ~4+ years ago and I know my mind is making stuff up, telling me all sorts of things, but the fact that I can’t remember the true details, can’t see old text messages to ease my mind, nothing is driving me insane. I spoke with a therapist, it helped a little temporarily but I can tell the thoughts are coming back now and I’m not prepared for another wave of debilitating anxiety. 

How can I deal with this? Do any of you have any coping techniques that don’t involve obsessing over the details that your mind is telling you happened?"

2297,Anxiety,How to stop chewing the inside of my lips,"I have a terrible habit of chewing up the inside of my lip. I do this pretty much all day especially when I am experiencing heightened anxiety. It is kind of a subconscious self soothing thing I guess.

I want to stop because it has gotten to the point where my lips are just always bleeding and chapped, and my jaw is so sore from the constant chewing. I swear my face shape has even changed because I just use my jaw constantly. The muscles have gotten bigger and I have a more masculine looking jaw line now.

I used to chew on gum to resist the urge, and that worked for a while but it ended up causing the same pain in my jaw so I had to stop 

Has anyone else gone through something similar?"
2298,Anxiety,How do you deal with anxiety induced diarrhea?,"Back in May I had a horrible 2 month long period of stress induced diarrhea. I went to the doctor, took blood, urine, and stool tests and everything came back healthy, so they blamed it on my stress. It went away for a short while, but recently I've been getting horrible flair ups again and it's getting in the way of my life. Not even pepto bismol can help me anymore. Eating more fiber and protein hust seems to make it feel worse. I have an upcoming ACT test on the 12th and cannot have another flair up during the test, so I need a way to make it stop fast.


Ik the only way to get rid of it completely is to get rid of the stress, but I need coping mechanisms in the meantime. Any advice?"

2302,Anxiety,I can't read,"Sadly, this is not a joke.

I've read one book this year. One. And I felt physically awful after reading it. It was a good book. I enjoyed it. I read it in March. Maybe it's the pandemic, I hear you reason. Nope, because last summer I read only one book as well: Cinder, of the Lunar Chronicles. And I loved it! I bought the rest of the series! But I haven't read any of them! And tonight I tried reading another book, but I only got 11 pages in. I bought a book in 2016 that I can't get past 2/3 in. I don't know how this book ends and I've owned it for almost 5 years!

Why is this a problem? Why dont I just stop reading?

BECAUSE I'M A WRITER.

I finished my book a few weeks ago. I have a bunch of books I intend to read before going into editing because my lack of being able to read for the past 3-ish years has severely dulled my style. My vocab use for that shitty Warrior Cats fanfiction I wrote in middle school is way more diverse than stuff I wrote this year.

Why am I like this? Is anyone else like this? I feel insane that I can't get past the first chapter of a book without having to splash cold water on my face."

2305,Anxiety,New job...quit within first month,"This year has been a rocker. So much dread, uncertainty, etc. This is my little story. I was given an opportunity to move for a job, kind of my dream job at the start of the year. I did. Then covid happened and everything went to shit. Lost my job a few months later. I was left with moving my entire life across the country for this gig, and then it fell through. I spent a few months trying to figure my life out and I was lucky enough to get on with another company. I thought the job I applied for was going to be a good fit but it turns out its not. Every single day is pure physical stress and anxiety. Physical manifestations of pain and grief and doubt. I can't take it anymore. I can't keep up with the pace and the quality of my has dropped significantly.

The last few months have been very taxing and I swear I have been fully of anxiety for almost a year now. I feel like I'm reaching a breaking point. :(

I feel like I need to quit, but I have a family and responsibilities in this new place. I feel like I'm drowning."
2306,Anxiety,"I am paralyzed by anxiety. I’ve tried meds and many therapists and self help books, you name it. Anxiety runs my life and has left me lost and overwhelmed. Any advice would be appreciated.","Hey everyone. I’m a 25yo guy who has dealt with social/general anxiety for as long as I can remember and severe depression for quite some time. Between multiple medications and many therapists, self help books, TedTalks, philosophy readings, even pushing myself out of my comfort zone and making great friends and trying new things you name it... I am still not seeing any progress.

I’m sick of it. I am so tired of being tired and of being lost and confused and anxious and worried and simply overwhelmed with existence. I know the world has beauty and good, it isn’t all sunshine and rainbows but there is an opportunity for a good well-lived life. But my depression, anxiety, and existential confusion has skewed my perspective towards negative thinking. At this point I don’t know what to do or where to turn because nothing has stuck. I’ve continued to end up right where I started despite trying different things and taking chances. It’s extremely difficult to move forward when doing mostly anything can be considered getting out of my comfort zone.

And I haven’t even discussed the existential doubts that have permeated my life. To be completely honest I don’t know who I am at my core - what I want from life, what I stand for, what I believe. I am simply coasting on sheer spite against death. I want to live. And I haven’t, I haven’t been able to. My existence, a brief flash of consciousness between eternal darkness, is (I think) the only opportunity I have at life. And I have the ability to choose, to determine what has meaning to me, to say this is what I believe THIS IS WHO I AM. However, I have no idea what to choose or what matters to me. In the face of this terrifyingly liberating idea I am frozen with fear. I’m aware my indecision will not get me anywhere other than what life decides for me, but I have no confidence in choosing anything else. I don’t feel knowledgable enough to say to anyone “I believe this and you should too.” “I stand for this and here’s why.” Because the only thing I know is that I don’t know anything. This goes for everything: which political policies work best, which form of education works best, what time I should sleep and get up to start my days, any of it... and that’s not a joke. I don’t know.

I understand this is overthinking matters. I have to “let go a bit” and “trust myself” and yada yada yada. That doesn’t answer anything. That doesn’t get me anywhere. I feel completely lost and I’m tired of hearing cliches. I can’t handle anymore “Nobody really knows what they’re doing. We’re all figuring it out. You’ll be okay.” They don’t know what they’re doing and that’s the elephant in the room! That’s the thing I’m trying to say! Why are they giving me advice when they don’t know what I’m going through and don’t know what they’re doing anyways? I can’t give any advice to anyone right now because I don’t know what they’re feeling or what they’re experiencing despite my best attempts to put myself in their shoes.

The most frustrating thing has been my inability to make decisions because I don’t see anything to be better than another (to a degree of course). I have to decide where to work, where to move to next when my lease is up, and so many other things I feel completely incapable of deciding on because I have no solid foundation to build my life on.

I don’t know.. that was just ranting at this point. But please, if anyone can message me or talk to me or offer some kind words I’d really appreciate it. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m so sick of it. I just want to live a good life and make the world a better place and be a good person but I don’t know what that “good” looks like whatsoever."

2308,Anxiety,how to deal with parents who struggle differently than you do,"my dad has anxiety and my mom had bpd and severe anxiety at one part in her life and still deals with depression. so i don’t understand why they get so frustrated with me when i can’t explain how i feel to them. i know their experiences with mental illness couldn’t have been roses and butterflies but when my dad gets mad at me for not getting sleep the night before, i start to wonder what they feel like when their anxious that makes them question me so much. my dad will even tell me it’s all in my head and that i’d make myself hyperventilate. and my mom doesn’t understand my want for privacy. i’m 17, 18 in may and she still has no personal boundaries with me, and gets offended when i establish them. she walked in on me crying the other day and got frustrated when i couldn’t give her an answer. i’ve never gone to a doctor, nor therapist for a diagnosis, but i’ve been dealing with these feelings since 7th grade. i’m also beginning a new direction in life since i stopped constantly smoking weed last friday and it’s made my anxiety skyrocket. i don’t know how to ask for help when they didn’t even know i was smoking everyday for months straight and when they don’t empathize with what i struggle with. 

tl:dr; parents both struggle with mental illness but still doubt the severity of my issues and i don’t know how to approach them in my time of need when they dismiss me."
2309,Anxiety,Anxiety and heart palpitations before bed caused by a trigger. Anyone else experience this?,"The last couple weeks my anxiety has kicked into overdrive right before bedtime. 

It’s really stupid, but for a long time, my cat would cry outside my door and it would end up stressing me out to the point where I wouldn’t sleep some nights. 

I somehow was able to fix that issue, but the other night, he cried again and it just brought back all of that stress. It was like a PTSD-type trigger. 

So now, in my head, I can hear him crying at my door (even if he’s not).  I have a fan going to add some white noise and even wear ear plugs, but I still convince myself that I hear something. 

My heart then starts to absolutely race and pound inside my chest.  I‘ll have shortness of breath too.

I’ve been able to go to sleep by either taking some prescribed Xanax or some OTC melatonin, but I hate relying on anything to get to sleep.

Anyway, has anyone else had night anxiety caused by some sort of trigger?  I know the cat thing is silly, but unfortunately I’ve built it up into a trigger for anxiety and haven’t been able to deal with it."

2313,Anxiety,How to start talking to girls again?,"So back in January before COVID hit i had an encounter with a girl at a party that changed my life forever. I was chatting up a girl at a party like i normally would and the conversation took turn for the worst when she brought up politics. Normally i avoid politics but she said somethings that i strongly disagreed with and in the moment i lost my temper a bit and cursed her out. She got angry about this and began to hit me and when some other guys at the party asked her why she was hitting me she lied to them and told them it was cause i grabbed her butt. I told the guys this was a lie but they took her word over mine and just kicked me out of the party. The next day i realized word of the incident was circulation around my school and found out people actually believed her and i was blacklisted from the parties. I didn’t even know the girls name and couldn’t get in contact with her to ask her why she would do this to me. This completely devastated me and people that i thought were my new “college friends” quickly cut me off and no girls wanted to talk to me. I became depressed over it and didn’t wanna leave my room luckily covid hit and we got sent home so i had an excuse to not leave my room for a few months. I ended up transferring schools and just finished up my first semester at my new school which i loved. The only issue is I now have a fear of talking to girls at parties because i’m nervous something similar is gonna happen to me again. I know it’s irrational but i’m still honestly shocked it happened to me in the first place and feel like it could easily happen again. Even though it happened almost a year ago I still replay the events in my head on a near daily basis, does anyone have any advise on how i can overcome this?"
2314,Anxiety,How do you overcome the feeling of disconnect?,"I didn’t realize this until today.

I feel disconnected from everything. I didn’t to my anxiety was bad right now. I thought I was managing it fine. Why am I not finding joy in anything?

My partner is the best and incredibly supportive. I hung-out with a close friend tonight, with my spouse.  And I felt nothing. I didn’t enjoy my time. I felt myself mimicking reactions.  It scared the hell out of me. I thought I was so excited to see her, and I was so incredibly disconnected. I could’ve been standing over my body watching myself interact like a normal human being. 

Has anyone else experienced this? Is this anxiety? Is this depression? Food doesn’t taste good. No matter how long I sleep I’m exhausted. I have no craving, no yearnings to do things. I obsessively want to have sex to feel something. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn’t. 

How do I fix this? Or help it? Why am I doing it?"

I can’t even sleep at night because I’m constantly scared that my house is going to be invaded by thieves or some demonic presence (I don't even believe in supernatural, in the day at least, but I'm still scared about it??? Why is my brain so stupid??). I don’t know why I’m so scared and anxious about it, but I am. The only time I can sleep is at exactly 4am. At 4am I feel safe and I don’t know why either. I start to get scared at 10pm. So from 10pm to 4am, I spent the time in constant fear and anxiety. It is so painful. Even when I’m sleepy, I don’t sleep. And the few times I manage to fall sleep, I wake up around 2-3 am screaming for no reason and in fear."

I am finding that I am getting absolutely CRIPPLED by anxiety before these dates and low key hope they don’t go well so I don’t have to go on another haha but I do ultimately wanna get married so gotta date ya know haha 

I have a second date with a lovely guy this weekend and I’m terrified of self sabotaging because my anxiety makes me internalise so much that I don’t feel very present and fun on the date, and quite often can’t think of things to say. 

I know this is coming from a place of feeling I’m not good enough (heightened by a year of not working and health conditions), as well as a few rejections already this year.

I also struggle with major anxiety messaging him between dates/waiting for messages!

2319,Anxiety,Panic or carbon monoxide,Hi I have severe panic disorder and recently just burnt the shit out of some salmon on accident and filled my apartment with smoke to the point where it was hazy but visibility was still good. I’m a college student living in a dorm so the windows don’t open and I spent maybe 30 minutes in the smoke calming everything down and making sure nothing could catch fire or produce more smoke. I’m in the hall now with my neighbor getting some fresh air and I’m not coughing or anything but I’m a bit light headed. I started reading up on smoke inhalation and carbon monoxide poisoning and now I’m wondering if this lightheadedness is from the smoke or my panic disorder.

would you call this anxiety, or something else? i don't really know how else to label this feeling. it's annoying and i know none of these concerns are real as i'm very close with family and my boyfriend, and i at least text friends once a day, but usually if i go a day or two without hanging out with friends (safely, as in over facetime or getting coffee outside) i get this awful feeling of isolation. i don't know what else to call this feeling, or the source of it, than anxiety"

I'm working on a few homemade things, but I have exams until mid december and then can I even afford to mail anything?

2324,Anxiety,"Easily startled by impact/bass noise (thunder, footsteps, neighbor's kids playing near our shared wall), and anxiety makes being at home on my days off unbearable. Any suggestions?","For whatever reason, I have this issue where sudden impact or booming noise sets off my anxiety like no other. I'm not like a war vet or anything so I have no trauma associated to hearing that kind of noise, so I don't know where it comes from. On my days off I'm especially sensitive to the noise, even when I have a TV going and my kitchen fan on. Sound travels weird in my apartment, so I can sometimes hear my neighbors (especially their kids) walking or running on the floor, and I can also physically FEEL the vibrations under my feet, along with hearing the noise. We think that while everything is carpeted, that we share floorboards with our neighbors and the floors in general under the carpet are very squeaky. The building was made in 1977 so I'm not surprised. 

So anyways, because of my extreme sensitivity to these noises, my days off have been unbearable. Anytime my boss asks me if I can cover someone on my normal day off, I immediately jump on it. I would rather be physically exhausted in my chaotic, physically-demanding job than mentally exhausted at home hearing random, unexpected thumps and bumps and someone blasting their bass from their car outside. 

Does anyone have any suggestions, or product recommendations? I'm sure I could make use out of something like noise canceling headphones, but they can be expensive so I dont know which ones would be the best, especially for reducing impact noise. Or if you happen to know of a good way to minimize the noise from somewhat poorly-installed carpets lol."
2325,Anxiety,"Found out my (34f) dad wasn’t my Bio Dad 9 yrs ago, still struggle...","Found out my (34f) dad wasn’t my Bio Dad 9 yrs ago, still struggle...

Tis the season for depression... i (34f) have gotten better throughout the years but I always get super emotional during this season. You see, I found out my father was not my biological father during Christmas time... my mother was putting decorations up at the time. I was 25 when I found out. I had a feeling I was being lied to since I was 16 years old, when I discovered my birth certificate had a different mans name under Father. I was super excited to get my license at the time... I asked my mother about the name on the certificate, “the hospital must’ve made a mistake... my English was horrible so they probably misheard me...” I believed her, after all, who would lie about something so important? I finally built up the courage to ask her again, on that cold winter day, while she was putting up declarations. “Mom, why is there a different name for my dad on my birth certificate? How can the hospital make such a big mistake like that? Can you please just tell me the truth?” My mother, had pain in her eyes, she paused for awhile and just said, “he was the one who planted the seed, but your father is your father, I’m so sorry for the pain this will cause...” I was livid. My tears weren’t tears of pain, they were tears of anger, and deceit. All these years of lies, and to top it off, everybody in my family knew, aunts, uncles, cousins, family friends, except my 3 other siblings... which whom I’m really close to. I was angry that i was lied to. My life seemed like it was The Truman Show... i felt like i was an Act in the circus, everybody knew BUT me. 

Backstory: My mother met my adoptive father when she was 3 months pregnant with me, my sperm donor wanted nothing to do with me, he wanted me aborted. She came to the US when she was 2 months pregnant with me and met my father... my father is the most amazing man I’ve known. I am truly blessed he was put in my life. Not once did I ever feel unloved or not his... that’s why it was such a shocker to me when I found out. My father never wanted me to know because he was afraid that I would look for my sperm donor... it pained him to know that I finally knew the truth. We don’t talk about it as much, it’s been 9 years since I found out. It’s hard during Christmas time because I get triggered. I have so much love around me, an amazing immediate family, but yet I still feel a void in my heart at times... why am I curious about my sperm donor? Why did he not want anything to do with me? Why was I not good enough for him? Why was I lied to all these years? I just don’t know if any of you have gone through something similar? I guess I don’t know where I’m going with this story, I just can use a support group or advice, or ears... I hope you all have a great holiday season

TLDR: Found out my father wasn’t my father at 25, still struggling with the after effects..."
2326,Anxiety,work anxiety,"I am an 18yo who currently works at a veterinary hospital, and i’ve been working here for about a year. During the pandemic we have stayed open and i’ve continued to work. When school started, a lot more stress kicked in and I think that is when i began to slack but I’m not sure. Overall i started getting really exhausted all the time and had barely any energy when i went to work. I guess this made me a bit more lazy than usual, as i never want to be the slacker. Just yesterday, a few of my coworkers and I had a position meeting (where members of the same position meet) and the two “leaders” told me and my other coworker that some of the Vets and Vet technicians have noticed that there is a lot of sitting around/cellphone usage/overall slack. They basically said that this is grounds to go to management, but they wanted to have a discussion first. I really appreciated that they decided to talk to me about it first before it got worse. I didn’t know how to react so i nodded and agreed and thanked them. I am so beyond embarrassed that i’ve been acting this way at work without even realizing it. Overusing my cellphone at work seems like the most pathetic thing ever and I basically am mortified that we even had to have this discussion. i held back tears the entire rest of my shift, and i am currently at home crying about it now. I am already so scared of judgement, and now i feel as though no one “likes” me at work due to this rough patch that i’ve hit. although this might seem childish, this is the dynamic i work in. I don’t know how to overcome this embarrassment. I have no excuses obviously, and i know i’ll be changing this behaviour right away. But how do i get over this feeling of shame and guilt? I have to take next Thursday off for exams and this makes me feel even worse about the whole situation. I have a goodish rapport with one of the leads of my position, and i am debating whether or not i should send a text to her, thanking both of them for the opportunity to improve and the reminder to stay focused. does anyone have any advice for how to overcome this embarrassment, and whether or not i should extend my thanks?"
2327,Anxiety,Can anyone help me understand the psychotic abnormalities I experienced as a child?,"Hello everyone, I wanted to ask Reddit about childhood anxiety experiences I had growing up that were incredibly difficult for me to understand as a child. I'll do as best i can to describe them.

(To preface myself, I did suffer quite a lot of frequent physical and emotional abuse as a child-- part of why I never received treatment for these episodes)

I started experiencing these symptoms around the age of 7-8 if I recall correctly. Looking back, I believe they would frequently be triggered by incrementally increasing sources of anxiety in my life (childhood fears).

I would always experience 2 very distinct symptoms. My vision would be skewered, where everything would look small, as if you were using a pair of binoculars backwards-- and I would hear sounds that weren't there. The sounds would be incredibly hard to even comprehend. They would be extremely ethereal and otherworldly, with pulsating and pounding effects simultaneously. They would be of sounds or voices I knew or didn't know.

In my limited vocabulary as a small child, I described the sounds as ""loud and quiet at the same time.""

I also remember referring to the entire group of symptoms as ""seeing small things and hearing loud things.""

Needless to say, both of these symptoms would serve to escalate my anxiety, and panic me further.

They would sometimes progress gradually, or I would sometimes wake up with the symptoms randomly.

It wasn't until I was about 13 that I figured out the issues went away when I distracted myself. If I ever felt them coming I would get out of my bed in the middle of the night to watch a TV show. By the time the show was over, the symptoms had faded.

These problems haven't resurfaced since I was about 14. However, I do suffer from general anxiety today, alongside ""conventional"" panic attacks from time to time.

Can any of you explain to me what at all I experienced as a kid? It has always been a ridiculously mystifying anomaly in my life that I have never been able to really understand. Thanks so much."
2328,Anxiety,I always compare myself to others and it is making me feel exhausted.,I compare myself to friends and think they are successful and i pressure myself to be like them. I in-turn  do things that i do not like and i am not happy  . How do i stop comparing with others and be happy with my past and present.
2329,Anxiety,Social Anxiety problem,"So I’ve got social anxiety. It sucks. I’ve literally just taken 5 minutes just to work up the confidence to post this. We had to do presentations for English and my group of friends and I were doing it together. Half joking I said afterwards that I thought my social anxiety was going to literally kill me one day. They told me I did super well though, there was no way I had social anxiety. 

So I showed them my script/notes and the paper was crumpled from my hands clutching desperately at something somewhat solid. Then I pulled my other hand out of my hoodie pocket and showed them the palm of my hand where the indents of my nails had a thin film of blood over them because I freaking broke the skin of my palm from clenching my hands together so tight. My hands were also shaking so bad I could hardly write anything without it being a bit squiggly on the page. 

I have never seen smiles drop so fast in my life."
2330,Anxiety,I accidentally took 100mg dose of Tofisopam (probably). Will I be okay?,I thought I hadn't taken it so I took again but I probably took it once. I'm currently on 50mg dose per day.
2331,Anxiety,Anxiety caused by my worry of what others think of me,"I’ve had anxiety ever since a few bad experiences almost 10 years ago, which have triggered anxiety that I’ve struggles with ever since. I go into social situations, whether friends or family, or with complete strangers, and I’ll feel vulnerable to physical anxiety symptoms being seen by other people. A few times before, people have noticed the physical anxiety symptoms, mostly dominated by an escalating tremor in my hands or legs if it gets bad enough. It always happens when the spotlight is on me, and more specifically when I have to do a fine task with my hands where they can’t be hidden, and people could notice. I know that there’s not much of a chance that people would notice and even if they did it wouldn’t matter, and I tell myself this constantly, but it just isn’t enough. I don’t know what exactly fuels my problem. It could be self image, where I don’t like the way I look and I’m afraid if what others think of me, or it could be that I just have unshakable performance anxiety. All I know is that recently I’ve found the best way to generally describe my problem, and my problem is that I care too much of what others think of me. I’ve been in therapy in the past, and I’ve tried numerous different medications of all classes, but nothing has worked or been a sustainable help (beta blockers, benzodiazepines, SSRIs, SNRIs, atypical antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihistamines) . I’m thinking about going to therapy again, but I want to know if anyone who has been in a similar situation as myself has had any luck, and what ways they were able to suppress or even beat the problem. What things do you think or say to yourself before, or while you’re in a situation where you’re trying to beat your physical anxiety symptoms? Even if you aren’t in my boat, what would you suggest I try or do?"
2332,Anxiety,Oh boy fuck this shit,[removed]
2333,Anxiety,Went to r/schizophrenia but FAQ sent me here,"So I (23F) know I have anxiety pretty badly as a symptom of C-PTSD, and while I pretty much know what my anxiety focuses around (usually health and being ""bad"" and death) and how to deal with it, I have been having new intrusive thoughts that scare me and I don't know how to work around them and it's really distracting. Basically, I think that demons are trying to trick me into getting pregnant with the anti Christ? But also like not really I know it's some kind of manifestation of my fear that I am somehow morally tainted and evil, and this is just the irrational and unprovable way my brain has decided to torture me. Im not religious really- raised Catholic but as an adult more agnostic with pagan/Buddhist leaning. This only really started when my very religious aunt informed me that the rapture was happening around us right now, and ever since I can't shake the fear that demons are around, that I am in some kind of secret hell world, and that random things Mean Something to that effect. It's not strong enough to be a delusion, it's just something constantly saying ""what if"" in the back of my mind. It's really annoying and I don't like reading onto things that are pure coincidence, like my boyfriend's video game arrows magically lining up to say 777. Obviously I jump to schizophrenia because of the nature of this fear, so I was just wondering if any other anxiety suffers experience a similar thing and if so, how do you combat it without like. Going to church and losing an important part of your personal identity? 
Thank you"
2334,Anxiety,(Minor TW cutting) didn't turn in my assignment,"It's been 15 days since my last post about this and it's fucking killing me, I once again forgot to do the assignment and my physics teacher just now gave me a vote

This wait has been fucking killing me and he didn't even give me a 2, he gave me some random letters and it doesn't even count in my gpa

I should already have received 3 2 because of other assignments I didn't turn in but he's just making me wait and I can't bear it anymore

Last night at 3 am when I found out the assignment was due today I started cutting, and I did the same last time because I was too stressed and it looks like he wants this"
2335,Anxiety,My mental health is not getting better,I currently live with my parents and I can't stand it anymore. Both of them say things that are hurtful and rude. I feel like I can't do anything and that I'm going to be stuck here forever. :( I want to move out so bad but I can't even afford to right now and I can't get the job I want because I don't have a car to get there or a license.
2336,Anxiety,Does this happen to anyone else?,"So I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder and I recently started medication (I'm 22, been having bad anxiety since 15 at least). I don't know if its helping, I honestly can't tell at this point, I don't know what my normal is. I feel like I mildly dissociate after taking it and time just passes really fast and before I know it my day is gone. Do other people on meds have this problem? I'm on zoloft right now.

I knew there'd be side effects to taking a medication but it felt like the only option left for me, I tried therapy, stress outlets, exercise, breathing techniques..... but having a panic attack mid-workout was not fun."
2337,Anxiety,I’m too scared to cook!,"We’ve just moved into a new flat (in the uk) share the 
Building with 12 other flats, and if our smoke alarm goes off ALL the smoke alarms go off. 
I set it off the other day. My anxiety is already triggered big time by loud noises in general, but alarms are one of the worst. It’s super high and I couldn’t even reach it when stood on a chair, luckily our next door neighbour is very tall and sorted it out (thought it took ages to turn off) 
The alarm is basically about 1m away from the oven and stove, I’m scared to even boil pasta or cook some toast, and I get anxious when my boyfriend is cooking. 
I’m scared I’m going to upset neighbours, I’m scared of the noise (I never really know why I am scared but I am), I’m scared I’m going to shouted at by annoyed neighbours. 
There’s nothing I can do about the alarm as we rent not own, and I love this flat, but I don’t want to feel like this for 2 years until we buy a house :( idk what to do about it 
I don’t even know if anyone else has experienced this but if you have how did you work to overcome this?"
2338,Anxiety,Agreed to pick up a work day now I regret it,"I'm so overwhelmed I have a toddler, and am so stressed with covid and child care as well as my fiance being in school while I work. I just agreed to add another work day but I regret it so much already. 
My anxiety is telling me not to say anything but I know I'm going to be burnt out and lose my mind. 
How do I discuss with my manager about possibly picking up the extra day on a temporary basis? 
I work in a stressful job that's only been made more stressful with covid and I've talked myself into a corner please help fellow anxiety ridden peeps."
2339,Anxiety,I screwed up due to a very severe bout of anxiety and agoraphobia. Need advice.,"So to try to cut to the point, I’m a 35 year old male. I’ve had anxiety my entire life. I have a prescription for way less xanax than I actually need and adderall for my ADHD. I am horrible about consistency with these and my other meds.

I’m going to physical therapy for a spinal surgery I had in early September. I am in tons of physical pain and not doing great with it. I need to go to a pain management clinic but I am so overwhelmed with doctors and meds and appointments I just haven’t set this up.

For the entire week after Thanksgiving I’ve been up with my dad who is basically the only family I see in person at all anymore. He lives in a small cabin on the lake, it was a vacation property that became his home when my mom divorced him I am up all day and sleeping all night. I’ve had the worst agoraphobia bout of my entire life. I haven’t set foot outside since last Wednesday. I am having trouble picking up the phone.

I didn’t even call my physical therapy to let them know I wasn’t coming and missed two appointments. At this rate I will miss tomorrow too. I don’t know what to tell them and don’t think they will understand so I didn’t call. I’ve been in a house with blackout curtains totally frozen in fear. And I need to go home to my cat who was given plenty of food and water - probably ten days worth, I know I’m a terrible pet owner for not coming back home yet. I need to see her face and hear her voice and I know she’ll forgive me as soon as the food can opens, maybe as soon as she sees me.

I also had an important text from a social worker I have left hanging since Monday. I really need her help and the therapist. What do I say to them? How can I make them understand?

I’m sorry this was so frenzied I’ve been trying to make myself leave and make the 2.5 hr drive home for about 12 hrs now. I’m sure I’ll get it but I’m not sure I have that therapy session in me but I don’t want to lose physical therapy completely."
2340,Anxiety,I can’t stand my job but I am too scared to leave it.,"**TDLR**: I hate my job but im afraid people will be disappointed in me for leaving after only working there a few months, and im scared I won’t be able to find a more suitable job that even pays well, with next to no customer interaction. Severe anxiety is making my life hell.
I don’t know what to do. 


I moved to a completely new state with my boyfriend, who is the hardest worker I have ever seen. He has done jobs and Stuck with them for years despite how difficult they were. He stayed at a darn fred meyers job for minimum wage for FOUR YEARS!

So when I moved in, I looked for my first on-the-books job with the intention of staying there and working hard just like him. Only problem is....I cant stand it. Every day I do this housekeeping job makes me wanna break down on a daily. Equipment doesn’t work, management is a joke, the entire place is a health hazard with black mold we have to scrub near daily because of how poorly rooms were built, I get only $13.25 an hour full time for doing my job PLUS extra jobs that other staff just don’t friggin do, and I hurt so bad after work. Ive only been working there since mid September... How pathetic would I be if I left so soon!?! 

I feel so much anxiety that it cripples me. I am afraid of everyone around me and prefer a life in my room away from everyone. I hate events, parties, and obviously customers. I chose housekeeping because it sounded like the only job I could properly avoid customer interaction. I was a face painter since 2011 and I can’t tell you how difficult it was to breathe when having to constantly interact with people. I just Cant Talk to people. My chest caves every time, I avoid eye contact and just completely shut down. Cleaning rooms by yourself sounded like a damn dream. I still pass the occasional customer or answer a quick question (which is still Beyond hard) but it’s really not often. 

But my body must not be built for this as I am in extreme pain every day after work. I take ibuprofen daily to try and combat it but that’s besides my point. 


What kind of job should I be looking for even if I did leave??? There’s nothing out there that pays a decent living wage AND has next to no customer interaction AND wouldn’t kill my body! And i’m so terrified that people will be disappointed in me for not staying at this job! Im scared my bosses will not speak highly of me if I leave so soon. I am just so scared of everything and it’s such a struggle. My boyfriend is doing all he can to support me, but my anxiety tells me he will look down on me for not just sucking it up and working hard like he does.... 


Please tell me im not alone...Is there a job out there for someone with severe anxiety (as diagnosed by my many therapists)?"
2341,Anxiety,Anxious before performance review - suggestions &amp; tactics,"My anxiety has skyrocketed this year, my former toxic boss left and I worked really hard to project my achievements to my new boss. 

It’s fine to read articles/self help books that tell you to combat anxiety by taking a ‘realistic’ view. What is a realistic view to someone who has known anxiety and abuse their entire life. What’s the difference between toxic thoughts taking over your life and letting yourself off the hook? 

She values humility and to not make a big deal of things. I’m incredibly anxious - although I’ve done well this year and got positive feedback from her many times. 

What are the tactics I can use to get through this weekend &amp; Monday? To appear normal, down to earth and better able to recognise constructive feedback?"
2342,Anxiety,Can’t stop retching,"Hey everyone, I’m just not really sure where to go and I’m quite frankly, at a loss of what to do. 
I’d really appreciate it if anyone has any advice. 

It started about 5 or 6 years ago, I would throw up almost everyday. It got better eventually, and I can control it better. It would just be gagging and retching, and I got back to a healthy weight. 

I thought I could live pretty normally with this minor inconvenience, which I’ve done so for a few years. But I really wish I don’t have to anymore. 

I’ve been seeing a new CBT therapist, but I feel like the retching issue is being brushed aside. So I’m just wondering what can I do in the mean time to deal with this. Until my therapist and I eventually get to working on this issue."
2343,Anxiety,I'm feeling...good?,"So  I recently posted about going to the doctors about panic attacks. It took two appointments and a week on valium while we got blood tests done and a health plan in place. The doctor took me seriously and got me a referral to a therapist which I'm hoping to start soon.

I also started Sertraline this morning before work. I was terrified this morning and expected the worst of the side effects and not being able to cope without the valium. Instead I'm feeling energetic and happy. It was a terrible day at work but all the normal things that would trigger panic or at least severe anxiety caused mild irritation at best. I've made plans to see friends tomorrow.


Can medication work this fast and actually be effective. Or is this just mania and my moods going to fall again? I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop."

My heart races I don’t sleep well and i just don’t know if I can take much more am i actually crazy is it anxiety and depression or something else?"

2346,Anxiety,Has anyone tried a SAD lamp for anxiety?,"I don't really have depression just bad anxiety. I was wondering if anyone had found that a SAD lamp helps with this? I know they're mainly for depression and while a few sites say they can help anxiety, I'm wondering if that's anxiety that's caused by depression if that makes sense? I find I only get depressed if my anxiety is severe and that's because I'm low about feeling anxious not the other way around.

Hope that makes sense!"

2348,Anxiety,Help - My Sister,"TL;DR - My sister has severe anxiety of leaving the house/ driving, and my parents are enabling it and refuse to admit/ address any problems. It is destroying my relationship with my sister and my parents. 


My sister (26) seems to be suffering with a really bad anxiety disorder and depression. She has always had anxiety but since Lockdown began in the UK in March of this year, she has deteriorated severely. 

She still lives at home with our parents and she has only left the house a handful of times in the last 9 months, and she hasn’t even gone into a shop or any other public place in that time. Any time she does leave the house, she just sits in the car and refuses to get out. She is working from home now and hasn’t even gone to her office to collect an extra monitor/ keyboard, so she’s been working off a laptop since the pandemic began. She makes up excuses any time I suggest that she should go and pick them up as to why she can’t. She has definitely developed a fear of leaving the house (agoraphobia) and sits in the house 24/7 doing nothing except working. 

She never cleans, her room is a mess, she doesn’t look after herself (has put on weight, stopped wearing makeup, lounges in pyjamas all day, doesn’t wash her hair often), she has no hobbies or interests, all she does is sit and watch TV in bed when she isn’t working. She also has a habit of taking a notion of starting something (yoga, lifting weights, etc) but this lasts one or two days and she gives up. She can’t stick to anything. She has been single for two years after breaking up with her fiancé and hasn’t dated once in that time. Mum admitted to me that she thinks my sister broke up with her fiancé as she didn’t want to move out. 

She also seems to have developed a fear of driving her car. My mum had to drive her car home from our nanny’s house for her (my nanny lives two minutes away). She never drives her car now, it just sits in the driveway gathering spider webs. During the week, I sent her a text and asked if she wanted to go for a coffee on Friday (today). She ignored the text and when I went home last night (I live with my boyfriend so only see her once/twice a week), she pretended to have not seen it but agreed to go. I asked her to drive us and she got very panicky, refusing to drive and made up excuses like “I hate drive-thru’s” and offered several times to give me £50 just so I would drive. I refused and she said she wasn’t going. I don’t understand where this fear of driving has come from as she has never been in an accident and used to drive 40 miles each way to and from work before the pandemic. Her reaction last night was ridiculous and really highlighted the problem to me. 

My parents only seem to be making the situation worse, I have tried speaking to them several times about my sister and they deny any problems and get extremely defensive and any conversation about it just leads to an argument. They actually enable all of her behaviour- They drive her everywhere (including a 10 minute drive to the nearest town to get her hair cut), they buy her groceries for her, they do everything for her instead of trying to address the problem. My mum also does everything for her (cooking, washing up, ironing). They are only making it ten times worse and I can’t do anything if they maintain that attitude towards it. 

When I talk to my sister about her behaviour, I finish the conversation feeling pretty positive but that soon disappears when her behaviour continues as is with no improvements. 

I have a fear that she is never going to move out and will be a burden on my parents for the rest of their lives. My parents seem happy to have her there for now but that will wear off eventually, and when it does it will be ugly. It’s their own fault as they have enabled the behaviour and she will not improve at all for as long as they continue doing this. My sister is too scared to talk to anyone (either a doctor or a counsellor) and my mum is refusing to take her to see someone. 

My sister needs help NOW and my boyfriend and I seem to be the only ones that can see it. I am at breaking point, it is affecting my relationship with them all and we used to be such a close family and it is affecting my own mental health now as well. I dread going home to visit them now as it just triggers me seeing my sister wasting her life when she could be so much better. 

Please suggest anything that I can do, I feel like I’ve tried everything and am at the point now where I feel like I have no option but to wash my hands of it, but I know that will haunt me for the rest of my life if my sister’s toxic behaviour continues. I haven’t even covered everything here but hopefully that’s enough for you all to go on. Thanks so much in advance for any help/ advice/ support. 😊"
2349,Anxiety,"Any time I'm injured or sick, I react way out of proportion","So here's what happened today: I was getting out of the bath tub and slipped. Managed to catch myself, so didn't hit my head or anything. But I did get a pretty good hit to an arm and leg.

But because my arm hurts and because my leg feels a bit weak and shaky, I'm worried there's something horribly wrong. Even though I objectively know that those are happening because I just slammed them into something and I'm still shaking a bit from the adrenaline.

Which is to say, the exact same things you'd get from any normal fall. These injuries are so mild that they didn't even cause a bruise, but I still freak out. And I do this with *everything* that happens. And if you asked, I wouldn't even be able to tell you what, exactly, I think is going wrong.

Its really annoying."
2350,Anxiety,All music causing panic attacks?,"I normally cannot listen to music because it is a trigger for me. Repetitive sounds force repetitive thoughts and so fourth. I can deal with music in a store or in a game because I am actively doing something else and I ignore it...

Because of christmas, my coworker has been blasting christmas music from her phone and singing it. I cannot work or focus and it gives me panic attacks. If I drive with music I panic because driving is mindless to me and the sound takes over. 

It just blows me away that so many people find comfort in music, yet it makes me mentally ill. I have been to anxious to tell my coworker to stop, and others like the music its just me. I want to quit at this point because of this person always eating stinky food and blasting music. I stay in the bathroom and cry and vomit and sh from the panic attacks over three times a day. I hate being a wierdo who can't deal with these things, but if I quit no one can cover this part of my hospital. I will also lose my insurance and medical needs will not be acquired."
2351,Anxiety,Does anyone else get really cold when anxious?,"Whenever I get anxious I get so cold I start shivering, many people get hot but I always just get really cold."
2352,Anxiety,Morning anxiety,"Does anyone else get anxiety really bad in the mornings? I wake up earlier and earlier these days because i wake up with anxious thoughts and cannot go back to sleep. Its 6 am right now and ive been up for 2 hours because the first thought I had when I woke up was some stupid thing at work i might have forgotten about. Then I check my phone and it says my google account was hacked while i was asleep. 

So now im just killing time before work but am so stressed out already. No wonder why im so exhausted by noon every damn day.

I just wish I could free my mind in the mornings of all my worry and doubt, but it seems amplified 10x. It makes it really hard to face each day."
2353,Anxiety,Some Thoughts I Needed to Get Out,"I realized I have anxiety... and I hate it. Sometimes I feel a rush of thoughts and sometimes I just shut down. Sometime it takes everything I have just to say something. I feel broken and weak and so mad. I want help and I can get help, but there’s just something really F’d up about having anxiety and wanting help, and having anxiety about getting help... I know what has to be done but I can’t take that step. Anytime I think about it, I get a rush of thoughts and my body will automatically whisper “kill me” to make it stop. Ive never had any suicidal thoughts, but hearing myself say it brings me back to reality. I’ve let myself and so many people down and I don’t want to do it anymore... I already asked a friend for advise and they gave me tons of support and Helpful information. I just don’t know if I can do it. And if I do, I know I will have to face an abundance of other issues and that is what is ultimately terrifying."
2354,Anxiety,Sleepovers,"I f (16)  am sleeping over a a friends house i just started to have a panic attack my friends are in the living room amd I ca hear them laughing im in her room rn I told her I was going to get my pjs on but now I'm shaking and crying and don't know what to do I kind of what to call my mum to take me home but dont know what to tell them. I feel like might be sick.

What do you think i should do?"
2355,Anxiety,Anxiety when my boyfriend smokes weed,"This is ridiculous, but I cant help it. I smoke weed myself, regularly, to help me sleep. Should be fine, right? But when my boyfriend does it, I get severely anxious. Its not like he's high all the time, just before bed. And he's always alone. My therapist can't figure out why it makes me so worried either. I think im crazy sometimes. I'm worried he'll make a dumb decision and hurt himself, or just forget about me. Does anyone else deal with this?"
2356,Anxiety,"anxiety, paranoia and diagnosis","I'm 17 years old and in college. Every since middle school I've thought I had anxiety. But I'm too scared to tell anyone or even go to a doctor because I'm scared they'll tell me I don't have anxiety or anything. I don't know why but yeah.

When I was in elementary school I used to stay up really late and eventually fall asleep out of fatigue or just cry myself to sleep because I would have really bad paranoia at night for absolutely no reason. Its gotten better since then but I feel like it's coming back.

In public I never feel comfortable. I feel self conscious about how I walk, how I sit, my posture, how I look, how I talk and I over think so God damn much. I can barely get sentences out because I'm so worried about how I'm saying it that I don't think about what I'm gonna say next. Im not even comfortable around my own family. I get so much anxiety doing anything outside of my own home, especially alone. 

Im starting to feel hopeless. I've lost motivation to get out of my bed. I've lost motivation to go to sleep or even eat. Im scared to talk to my friends. I just don't see a point in anything anymore. Only reason I get out of bed is to play video games. I even gave up on one of my premed classes and im gonna fail it.

Should I go to a doctor? Is there anything a doctor could even give me that's worth it? Should I tell someone? I'm just so scared of my thoughts being invalidated. I just need something. 

I just don't want to go to therapy. And I'm scared my parents take me if I say anything. Either that or they tell me its not that big of a deal."
2357,Anxiety,Anxiety I think causes me to be impatient with people and come across rude especially with family but not at work I am meek and timid,"I obviously don’t want to come across rude to my family but I do get angry with them quickly, whenever they criticise me or talk about something which is pointless. Whenever I present an idea and they shoot me down I get frustrated or if I like something and they don’t I get annoyed. If they try and take over from something I’m doing to help me I feel annoyed even though I know they want to help I feel they are annoyed at me for taking too long. I feel like these are attributes of a teenager not an adult. I am ashamed and I want to be better. 

At work I’m not like this I’m polite and quiet I do my work and I am patient with people. I do get anxious at work but it is more about me and my performance. When I get critiqued at work I understand their point of view I do get a bit defensive which I have stopped now I know they are saying it to better me. I feel at work critique is manageable as I can just do a plan and work on it. Whereas with family they just say you have a rude tone sort it out.. like how?? 

Any advice? If you can tell me why I do this that would be helpful. I think apart of it is low self esteem but why is it only with family? 

Thanks"
2358,Anxiety,Just printed my 2 weeks notice,"I’m majorly freaking out. My mental health has not been the greatest and my husband and I both feel like it would be best for me to quit my current job. My plan is to do it today.

I know I care wayyy too much about what they will think and how my coworkers will react and that in reality, I do not owe them anything, but my heart is still pounding and my stomach is in knots.

This won’t really come as a shock to most of my coworkers as they mostly know how stressed and drained I am. I think upper management and my supervisor will be completely blindsided and I have a feeling they will question me and my decision.

My biggest fear is physically handing the notice to my supervisor and my current plan is to try and find a time where she isn’t in her office, leave it on her desk, and email her saying that if she would like to talk about it, I’m free. The thought of physically giving it to her and watching her read it is mortifying. The problem is she’s ALWAYS in her office. She sits at her desk all day. Fingers crossed I can get my notice in without puking or having a mental breakdown! 🤞🏻"
2359,Anxiety,Dealing with anxiety disorder without meds?,"Hi everyone, I hope you are doing well. I suffer from anxiety disorder that comes with depression and panic attacks, and all I ever did is get medicine, but I am tired of them. Missing one dosage and I feel terrible. Also learning new things is a pain, I am in university and I barely manage to learn anything new. Is there a way I can deal with anxiety and depression without medicine? I'd love to hear your stories and feedback."
2360,Anxiety,Weird head feelings due to anxiety/stress,"Anyone else’s head feel weird at times like a spaced out, lightheaded type of feeling. Where you look around and it’s feel like it’s in slow motion. Maybe like you be had one to many and maybe feel a little unsteady. I suffer with health anxiety but i do try keep telling me it’s the anxiety and stress or even maybe eye strain from too much video games ha."
2361,Anxiety,I need to get this off my chest,"I really don't know were to start. So I've been dealing with anxiety for a long time now. I suffered really bad from it but im better now. So im 15 years old but I remember that some day 2 years ago my anxiety started. At this time i didn't even know clearly what anxiety was and i had no idea i suffered from it. It all started when  before going to sleep I would overthink a lot and make myself nauseous in some way? Idk how to explain but my heart rate would go up and i would feel really really nauseous. This happened when i felt lonely but i didn't know that until now. So my parents got divorced when I was like 9 and they've always been there for me, but not emotionally. Of course I could approach them and tell them my personal problems but they were never there. My dad was always working and on the weekends when sometimes i would go to his apartment id rather not spill alll my problems and ruin the weekend. The same happened with my mom , i live with her but she's never here. Im so thankful for both my hardworking parents but they were never there for me. Since I was small i remember my mom asking me what should she buy for me, and she would bring me a lot of things just to compensate the time we were not together. Now thinking about it my life was so depressing back then. I literally got ready for school, went to school were i got bullied for almost 2 years, then got home and ate alone, did my homework, try to tell my little brother not to break things, and maybe give him food and stuff, and my mom would just come back at night and not even say hi. Well going back to the anxiety thing, yes that happened for 3 years. I slept for almost a entire year at 2am when i was like 13 because i was afraid to vomit and i couldn't sleep, and i would be all shaky. Now that i think about i think it was me unconsciously wanting by moms attention, and this anxiety only happened at night because its the only time she was available lol. You may think my mom worked all day, well sorry to break it to you but no, she literally would go and eat with her friends instead of me and my brother, and at night she would go to parties and not come back till the next day at night. I was at my lowest point when in front of my dad i had my first anxiety attack. It was the worst. Deadass i want to cry right now remembering how i cried and shaked in bed all nauseous at my dads apartment after he picked me up at a party cause i was not feeling well. When we were in the stairs up to his apartment i fell down crying cause i couldn't take it anymore and he just stared at me and went upstairs. I also had several anxiety attacks with my mom and she would do nothing. I had to cry silently in my room cause she had to sleep. Then somehow I took control of myself and i discovered all this im talking about and im better now. Much better. My anxiety however came back last year when my relationship with my mom went worse than it already was. So she got a boyfriend, and she had never presented me any of her boyfriends ever before so this was new to me. He was a nice dude but I didn't really love him or hate him. Any little thing i said to him she would overthink it and then when he was gone, she would scold me really badly about it. Like one time I was going to a friends house and I passed to the kitchen fast and I was in a hurry and my mom and him were there so i just gave him a quick hug of like hello and then went and my mom got mad at that. I hated her boyfriend because thanks to him she was less in the house. I literally would not see her in days. Or there were weeks were all i would say to her was, can you please buy more apples lol. Then somehow i found out he cheated on her 2 times and still got back together, but now they broke up again. Also when i want to talk to my dad he is busy or ignores me or just listens to me with a face of i don't give a fuck what your saying. I feel so fucking lonely, like  i really can't anymore. Im not suicidal though. Ive thought of it but its too scary. Also i hate school, like the workload is too much for a 15 year old. I have friends but they don't get me at all. And i kind of have trust issues. I also don't like the way I look, and when i talked to my mom about maybe getting a minor nose job she got all excited and sad, yessss and you should get your chin done too. Since then i feel like my chin is wrong someway. I also never can sleep because i overthink but not in a depressing way i just overthink. Also my relationship with my younger brother sucks. And that makes me really hurt because i feel like he's the only one that could kind of understand me and apart from that HES MY BROTHER. Im tired of life. More with this pandemic going on."

2364,Anxiety,"Air hunger, anyone else? Anxiety I think.","I know this is somewhat unorthodox, but about a month ago my mom started choking suddenly. It was really bad but she was alright after an hour. Since then I feel anxious even when someone midly coughs(The covid pandemic has multiplied this feeling I guess). I think this has manifested into                air-hunger/shortness of breathe in me. Gastritis doesn't help either. 

Anyway, I had this air-hunger like three weeks ago. It was intense for 2-3 days when I thought I couldn't take a deep breathe. This subsided for sometime(about a week). I could take deep breathe but I would still have this urge to take a deep breathe every now and then.  I was fine. But since yesterday I again have developed this urge to take a deep breath every now and then.  A light dizziness too.

&amp;#x200B;

 The pattern of circumstances that lead to this twice is also quite similar. About a month ago our internet was down for a day, exactly at that day my shortness of breathe seem to peak. Our internet was down day before yesterday and since then my air hunger increased again.  I don't think this means anything but still.

Also, I was following USA election rigorously for like 3-4 days straight and it was a rollercoaster of emotion(I am not even from the US, I don't even know why I was so interested). Around the same time I was following covid news a lot. I think this got the best of me and gave me anxiety. I think this has contributed so wanted to put it out there.

&amp;#x200B;

Ps. I am sure this doesn't mean anything but I had a parasitic worm(prolly pinworm) some days ago and I took albendazole twice, today I got my stool checked again I was free from the worm. So yay I guess.."
2365,Anxiety,My Mind Keeps Finding New Worries?,"Sometimes it feels like every time I'm able to identify and feel better about one stressor which is triggering my anxiety (e.g. recognizing that COVID is making me feel a lot of time pressure, that I'm experiencing stuff with my family), my mind literally searches to find something else to wake me up in the morning with and make me feel panicked about.

I've never been anxious like this before and there is literaly no triggers for me to be anxious, my life is great.

My work is exhausting and demanding, and althought not going to the office has it's benefits, I feel like now I am expected to be available 24/7. Several months ago, while still working, I moved to another country and started a very demanding academic programme. Still - life is on Zoom. Socializing in non-existent. Lately, I have been experiencing anxiety/panic attacs  but now - infused with paranoia. 

Sometimes I am not sure if I say things aloud that people hear me or not in these zoom meetings and lectures. I spend all my time alone, if I am not on zoom, I talk to myself as I study. 

**In short:** Normal life turned  completely online. Now experiencing massive amounts of anxiety infused with paranoia that people can hear/see me do things I do not want them to. 

**Question:** Has anyone had a similar experience and how to cope with this strange and alarming sensation?"

2373,Anxiety,I have this horrible anxiety that people are always listening,"Ever since I can remember, if I’ve ever spoken about someone to someone else (say, something they did or said) I have this paranoia that they are somehow listening. Like.. I’m accidentally recording it or we’re somehow accidentally on a phone call. I got it as a young kid a lot, if I was doing something embarrassing I was terrified that everyone from my school would actually be watching (even alone at home) and I’d be humiliated. It makes it quite hard to speak openly out loud, I’ve had to turn off my phone fully in therapy sessions and stuff and it makes me speak as if the people are always listening. I even write in journals as if they’re reading it. I don’t know how to get over this or stop having this worry?"

2380,Anxiety,I messed up,"So it's something simple. But my Boss buys us lunch occasionally, and he even once gave me a fit bit he just had laying around his house. Granted he wasn't using it but it was cool of him.

Today my kid who works with me brought me two sausage egg biscuts for breakfast. I couldn't eat both and offered one to my coworker, in part because I know my boss is often concerned about his weight. He was probably just messing with me but he came out, jokingly made a comment that I didn't bring enough for everyone, and then saw my coworker with it and said ""Shit, he got one!"" 

I played it off, and joked with them, but now I feel terrible. So much anxiety and craziness now, and wishing I would have offered the extra to him first. Stupid little things like this set me off all the time."
2381,Anxiety,Losing my mind?,"Recently I've been feeling as though my thoughts and actions aren't my own. Like some other force is forcing me into the life I live. 

I don't care about money, I don't want too. Yet I do because it's needed too live... I work myself to the bone every god damn day for only just enough and there are those out there who never lift a finger and have all of the shit. How does money work? Where does it come from? Who decided I need it for food? Who decided that this is how hard I must work too just get by? And get by for what? What am I doing? Keeping this shitty society from collapsing? I don't like the society so why am I forced into helping it keep afloat?

I was born with congenital toxoplasmosis (look it up) and have been feeling like it's the reason for my thinking process and how racey and weird it can be. 

I think there's a society of individuals, above government, only out for their own benefit running this whole damn show and forcing everyone through psychological manipulation to keep their shit show running cause it benefits them, we're nothing but pawns for them, tools too make their lives better. I'm a tool, nothing more, my pain doesn't matter as long as the job is done and they force me to get the job done by making money something we need too live and drip feeding us juuuust enough too live and by making it a status symbol so that we crave more so that we work longer and harder hours to get more so that we can be seen as a valuable and attractive member of society. 

I don't wanna sleep, I must sleep.

Maybe it's not the parasite, maybe it's the master society making me insane by depriving me of human needs? I don't even know what human needs are... food and water is one, shelter, socialization is but what's under the umbrella of socialization? I dunno maybe there's something I'm not getting that's making me loopy, maybe it's the parasite? I dunno. Doctors don't care, other people don't care. Every day is a scary and blurry mess. Is western society one giant fuck up that people need too be sedated to go along with? Is a parasite in my head making me paranoid? Honestly, I have no idea. I just know the thoughts hardly stop. Never finishing a sentence in my head. Nothing is congruent, everything is confusing.

2385,Anxiety,This is making me really anxious.,"Hi guys,

So over the past week now I have been somewhat anxious about my intrusive thoughts. Below are examples of them but before I tell you them, I have an immense fear of developing schizophrenia or psychosis.

1. Worried about what if my family don’t love me.
2. What if people bugged my car, how would I know.
3. What if my girlfriends parent want to harm me when I come over to stay.
4. What if my food was poisoned
5. Earlier on my cat followed my mum upstairs and I automatically got the thought of “are they going upstairs to plan to hurt me” it give me unbelievable anxiety and as much as I know the thought is absolutely shocking and obscene but my ocd made me question my own thinking if it WAS real or not 🙄

I’m guessing OCD can make you doubt your rationalised thinking? Like it will be “ok but what if you actually do believe it and you don’t know it” has anyone else ever had anything like this and btw this isn’t every day this waxes and wanes throughout the year and there is times when I don’t think this but it puts me in so much panic it’s unbelievable.

Also, if it’s not a what If thought, does this mean it’s not OCD? What I mean by this is what if I had a thought differently from “what if my foods poisoned” what if the thought was “they could poison my food” but I still get the terrible anxiety from it. Hope this makes sense. So does it need to be a what If thought for it to be OCD and not schiz or can it appear in your head any old way and still be OCD ?

Thanks,
Brandon"
2386,Anxiety,Random spurt of anxiety,"Hi everyone! So I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety for a while but ever since May I’ve been having an interesting problem. I will be in a conversation with one person or a group of people and then become overwhelmed with what I believe to be social anxiety and sadness. My heart will start beating fast and I would have to keep myself from frowning (my mouth will keep twitching trying to frown). Also I will feel like I have to cry out of nowhere which makes me more anxious because I don’t know what’s going on. These feelings will happen mostly during the times when I’m listening mostly in the conversation. 

The only way I can usually get it to stop is to bury my face in my phone and try to calm down. Or sometimes it just won’t stop and I either ride it out or exit the conversation. 

Has anyone else experience this and have any tips? It doesn’t happen all the time, but I would like it to stop or figure out the cause because it doesn’t happen during every conversation."

Usually I’ll leave without getting what I need because of it.

2391,Anxiety,Does anyone have constant joint popping/cracking and eye floaters after engaged with anxiety issues?,"Hi guys, pretty desperate and need help from this friendly sub. So long story short, in late August, I had this really bad anxiety thinking I might be seriously ill. I started to have serious brain fog, random muscle twitching (tremor I think?), frequent joint popping/clicking all over my body, and a stiff neck with constant pain.  I Was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma 7 years ago but got treated. I went to get checked in September, and the result came back fine, no signs of any tumor or cancer development, but I still feel all the bad symptoms. Doc said I have anxiety disorder, which is actually not a surprise because I have been having anxiety issue related to the cancer, but never this bad. 
So my problem is, are these all common signs of anxiety disorder? Or do I have something else? Like I have checked with symptoms of CFS, but I do not have PEM, like I feel low energy under the anxiety, but I can do exercise without crash the next day. What is wrong with me exactly?"

*Mail-in voting has drastically altered the trend of results tonight*

- The whole USPS controversy as well as COVID led many (generally on the left), to send in mail in ballots. In some states, these are counted last, and ballots that were mailed in today won’t even be counted tonight. 

-Generally, some people on the right have been more skeptical of the USPS, and are generally more inclined to vote in person despite to COVID. So you’re seeing more of these right-leaning ballots being counted first, and being displayed on the live televised results.

I know this is so so stressful, but hopefully some perspective can help ease some minds’"

I feel so done, so tired, so hurt. I always give my 110% to each of my services, I thrive to do a near perfect job and they have mocked my hard work and my biggest accomplishment. I am shaking.

Which makes sense to me because I just realized that I had it for a while but it was just normalised. One of the things that I have severe anxiety about is that I recently financed a car as a recent college grad. And I am having severe buyers remorse and anxiety about making a bad decision which to me I feel like it was not the smartest move for me financially speaking. The day after I made the decision I was super anxious, having anxiety attacks in my bed and I couldn't sleep and to this day the anxiety is still there about it and I get mini-anxiety attacks. How can I calm myself down?"
2400,Anxiety,"Went to a job interview today. Left halfway through as an anxious, crying, angry mess.","This is the second job opportunity in the last month I've completely fucked up due to anxiety. I don't know what the fucks wrong with me. The questions came flooding in and I just didn't know how to answer, I was completely lost for words, I couldn't stop thinking, couldn't stop fidgeting, looking away, sweating. I was about to burst into tears because it was just too stressful. I ended up saying ""don't worry"" and just walked out the door in tears and into the elevator, which is when I started punching the elevator wall. After I got out, I cried and cried, had a cigarette, burned myself with said cigarette because I'm such a fuck up. Then had to hold myself back from smashing and breaking things... I then went to the museum for some reason and spent the rest of the day walking. I just arrived home like nothing happened.. I was looking forward to talking with my new councilor over the phone and explaining what happened, but he never called. So I figured I'd vent to Reddit, once again."
2401,Anxiety,I Submitted a Math Worksheet!,"I’m a first year university student, and I’ve never been good at or liked math. It’s gotten really bad since coming to college to the point where I feel sick to my stomach even thinking about going to math class. I get really bad test anxiety and either get the right answer but have NO idea how to show my work or do the work right and make a mistake at the last step - getting a wrong answer! It’s been really discouraging, and with my other mental health getting bad, I haven’t submitted or done any math work for the past week, which certainly doesn’t help the D I already have in this class.

But! Today I submitted a math worksheet that I had for homework! I started it yesterday and was able to do a couple questions, and then I finished it and submitted it today! I watched the lecture videos, took my time, carefully checked my work... and I was able to finish it and turn it in! My work probably has plenty of things wrong, but compared to not completing and turning in any work for the past week, this is a huge improvement!

Considering everything else going on, this victory, while small, is much-needed."

2403,Anxiety,Parents making your panic attack worse,"I was giving the literature exam and uploaded the papers to the site.

Mother comes in unannounced and tells me to recheck since there might be something wrong, in the last 2 minutes.

I panic and notice something in my paper, I rewrite it. Upon uploading, I delete the original files and upload the rewritten ones. 

Mother tells me what I wrote was wrong, I start having a panic attack. Hyperventilation, shortness of breath, moving around, pulling my hair, and hitting my head.

Mother starts yelling at me about how I'm just an attention-seeker who is incapable of writing a correct answer.

The panic attack gets worse, I experience suicidal thoughts. Mother leaves.

I compose myself, message the prof and she gives me an extra minute. I upload the correct file.

Mother comes in again and tells me how I should be ashamed that I made her angry, and had her yell at me because of my incompetence and how I want her validation but do it through uncouth ways. I was also told off about her throat is going to get soar because of my panic attack.

&amp;#x200B;

Any similar experience or advice?"
2404,Anxiety,anxious,"my best friend's mother passed away last night and i couldn't sleep. i can't even imagine what he's going through, i can't even imagine a waking up and not seeing my mother alive. i was thinking about how it's gonna really suck when someone you love will die or even when you die. i was in bed last night thinking all this and i'm still kinda thinking about it and can't stop. what do i do?"

2406,Anxiety,Adult separation anxiety from parents,"My mother has always been very over protective of me to the point of causing so much trauma that I still struggle with. It’s a long story but the point is I still live with her. I’m in my 20s but I can’t move out. I can’t because I’m too used to living with her and my deep hatred towards her has recently shifted into forgiveness? understanding? I don’t know. I’ve come to appreciate her way more than before to the point of it turning into separation anxiety. I think I’ve always had it because I was never allowed to make any decisions for myself and she would make me feel immensely guilty for leaving her out of my personal life. 

So as an adult it’s all rushing back and I’m feeling so anxious. I can’t concentrate too well when I’m away from her and the thought of possibly moving out brings tears to my eyes lol I worry for her health and her wellbeing so much that it’s confusing. Maybe it’s a side effect of ptsd or depression. I want to get therapy but it isn’t an option where I live. 

I enjoy living with her and that’s great, as I always felt suffocated in her proximity. She’s still controlling in some ways but it’s like I’m so used to it that I can never imagine another way of life. She refuses to let me become independent. I used to hate it so much but as I grow older and my life becomes more uncertain by the year, I seek comfort in her controlling behaviour and I’m able to feel at peace in this house. Thoughts of finding a life for myself terrify me now. I feel like I’m a child again and would like to spend the rest of life with my mother. 

It’s not an impossible idea, but something tells me I’ll regret everything if I do give into this strange longing. I’m also pretty sure I’m on the autism spectrum so maybe that plays a part. I just want to burrow away into our nice little house and shut myself from the outside world."
2407,Anxiety,Swallowing soft foods,"I’m not sure what happened but a few days ago I notice when I swallow softer foods like applesauce or ice cream it feels like my swallowing reflex is there but very faint, but it’s a bit better when I’m eating foods that have more substance like donuts or pizza. I don’t know why but a few days before this happened I was swallowing all types of foods fairly well. Idk if my wisdom tooth coming in is causing me to have my swallowing get worse or what but I’m so upset that I was doing so well and now I’m struggling again."
2408,Anxiety,I need to get this out of my chest.,"My story with anxiety is actually short. My first time dealing with it was this year on February, I got an anxiety attack and I even went to the hospital because I didn't know what was going on.

After that, I didn't suffer from anxiety until April. I got sick and I couldn't breathe properly. I started to worry about it being coronavirus, or maybe there was mold in my room (I got a bad experience with mold some time ago) so the air was contaminated... Then the night came and a lot of stuff happened inside my body. I felt pressure on my chest, I was cold, I needed to cry. I tried to control my breathing but when I started to feel better, I just got back again and again.

I spent some nights like that, and finally my illness ended and with that my anxiety too. But now I'm feeling anxious again. I'm a bit sick so I guess that was the trigger. I can't sleep because I can't stop thinking about my anxiety, I feel like there's no escape. I feel my heart beating too fast and I don't find a way to lay in the bed that doesn't feel like I'm crushing my heart. I don't really know what to do.

I had a depression some years ago, but now I'm fine about that. I had more stuff related to my mental health, and little by little I've been able to improve. But now I feel like no matter what my mind is going to find a new way to mess with me.

I'm not sure if this is is interesting enough to read, but I really needed to talk about in some way."
2409,Anxiety,A short story about panic attacks. looking for some feedbacks on conveying panic well.,"It starts with a growing sense of unease.
something you can’t quite put a finger on, not enough to put you in a state of alarm, but enough to sit idly in the back of your mind. Its nothing to worry about, you tell yourself. Your instructor continues drumming on and on about something, biology, maybe ,but your mind was elsewhere. You hadn’t slept well last night, a nightmare perhaps? if you had one you certainly couldn’t remember the details. You recall feeling strange, a little lightheaded and uncomfortable, as though you were expecting horrific news. But why? No such news had come at all. There was nothing to worry about. Suddenly, you began to feel a bead of sweat drip down your forehead. Strange, the room was always set to a chilly 68 degrees, you often poked fun at your fellow classmates disdain for the cold room, despite living in the oppressively hot hill country of south Texas she frequently showed up here looking like a disgruntled Eskimo bundled in a hilarious amount of layers. Still, It was rather brisk in here, so why was I beginning to sweat? The strange way you felt last night begins to replay it’s self over and over in your mind. What did it mean? 
Still, its nothing to worry about you assure yourself, though your foot has begun tapping nervously and more sweat has begun to bead on your face. Your apprehension begins to grow, the cogs in your head have begun turning more quickly, you’ve become oblivious to your surroundings, all the instructors words swirl around you but none manage to find their way to your ears, your thoughts remained fixated on what you were feeling. What did it mean? Were you coming down with something? your discomfort continues to grow as you repeat the question over and over to yourself. What does this mean? why do I feel like this? 
	As this disturbed metamorphosis starts to take over, your worry begins to intensify, your thoughts are no longer in the present. they have begun to race, jolting like lightning from synapse to synapse. You began to feel the blood pumping in your ears, or had you always noticed that? No, this was growing louder, more sinister, as though it was whispering evil things to you. No longer does your diaphragm expand widely and calmly as it should, now your ribs have become a prison, and each time you exhale the cell walls grows tighter. Your head begins to swim, a cold tingling runs down your core, starting somewhere deep inside you and scuttling like an infestation down through your veins, reaching your fingertips and shooting back up. Your skin grows hot and begins to feel restrictive. As though you have become trapped in your own body. rationality has now lost all meaning, Thoughts of death and illness run rampart in your mind. Your pupils dilate, and your muscles all began to tense up preparing to fight an unseen adversary ,A faceless, cosmic horror lurking just out of view, its awful presence growing nearer….but where?? Your eyes began darting across the room, suddenly everything has become threatening, distorted, twisted. Nothing looks real, The fluorescent lights of the room now cast a sick unearthly glow on the surroundings, The walls seem to be threatening to close in on all sides, faces look grotesque and almost otherworldly and their eyes seem to pierce into your soul. They are all so calm, don’t they know your dying? Everything seems to be moving slowly, as though you are experiencing time differently then the rest of the world. Your heart pounds harder and harder as your breathing quickens. You desperately hunger for air, although the more you suck down the more you seem to suffocate. Now, what started as a slight unease has accelerated to primal terror. Your heartbeat has now grown impossibly fast, thundering in your ears like crazed percussion solo, threatening to reach a fatal crescendo that drowns out all conscious thought. You have ceased to exist, now just a vessel of uncontrolled terror. Sweat pours down your brow, you must escape this place. You awkwardly excuse yourself and stagger into a near by bathroom, collapsing in a crumbled heap against the wall, gasping for air when suddenly, air comes. You gulp it down at first in desperation but then in excess, as the icy cold dread slowly melts away, you cant help but smile. You’ve cheated death after all! A bell rings outside, but your okay, still feeling euphoric from the rush of surviving. You wash your face and walk back into the hallway with a newfound sense of confidence, your peers none the wiser, but as you stroll into your next classroom you cannot help but notice a small sense of unease beginning to grow, not enough to put you in a state of alarm, but just enough to sit idly in the back of your mind. It’s nothing to worry about, you tell yourself."

I no longer have contact with my mother. I do not sleep well. I'm always in pain but I'm essentially going into this completely knowing I'll have to care for myself post surgery.

2414,Anxiety,Zoloft sexual side effects,"
I'm an 18 year old male who takes 200mg of steraline (zoloft) a day to treat OCD. My girlfriend and I recently became sexually active, and I'm experiencing awful sexual side effects. At first, it just took me a while to finish, but in the past couple of weeks it has gotten progressively worse, to the point where I stopped finishing entirely and, recently, was unable to even stay hard long enough to get remotely close. I have no idea what to do, and it really fucking sucks. She's ridiculously important to me and in all other regards our relationship is perfect, but this has been putting a lot of strain on it and I feel so guilty. I feel trapped in my own body and mind, and helpless to keep hurting her and stressing myself out. I wish things could be normal, but I have genuinely no idea where to go from here. We have very open and honest diologue about it, but it's still getting worse, and it's still straining us more and more. Any help at all would mean so much to me."
2415,Anxiety,I'm back again,"It's 7:20 and I've already had a mental breakdown. I woke up at 5 today, to get ready for my internship. It was important that I go, because I was going to talk to my supervisor about my anxiety. My school facilitated the appointment because I went to them about feeling anxious and feeling unable to do my internship. Every Tuesday when I wake up I feel anxious. And throughout the day it builds until it's 22:00 the time I'm supposed to go to bed so I get enough sleep. And every Tuesday night without fail I don't go to bed at 22:00 because I'm afraid of tomorrow. And now it's tomorrow. I couldn't sleep well last night, I was riddled with nightmares as usual. I woke up with dread. But still I got ready and I went. I cried the whole way. And I stood there not a hundred metres from the front door, I was right on time. But somehow I couldn't move my body, and I watched the time go by until I was late. And then I went back home because no matter how much I told myself I was fine and that I could do it I couldn't get myself to move.

I always fail I always let my anxiety win and I'm tired of it."

I’m in NZ so COVID doesn’t play into this but in the last month, I have quit my job, moved cities and into my boyfriends house who I was doing long distance with and his six year old son. I am three weeks into a new job and haven’t had much of a break.
I’ve gone from looking only after myself, and thinking about me, to being a companion to my partner on a new level. I have no vehicle and although I’m on the hunt, I feel less independent.

Thankfully, what calmed me down, was putting logic into my fear, and breathing. I'm almost proud of myself. 

But... It was horrible, I've never felt such vivid unrealistic fear ever! It was terrifying. I hope I never have anything like that again."

I’ve started a new job and I cannot tell if it truely it’s not right for me or it’s my anxiety. I wake up worried and alarmed - I go to sleep worried and alarmed. I’d say currently there is not one moment of the day that I’m not feeling anxious and my mind is going astray thinking about regrets In the past, worrying i’m going to die alone or be sacked abruptly amongst the million other worries I have. 

My question is has anyone successfully quieten their mind? Like all of us can tesify we constantly get told, meditation, yoga. I’ve tried both and i’m so highly strung/anxious I cannot get into either. Medication is obviously not working great but i’ll stay on it. Any other things that have worked for you??

I over think everything. I'm 25 now and I'm still sitting at home not sure what to do with my life. My parents never yell at me for not having a job, but I wish they would. It could be the push I need to get through this.

Now just went down a google hole to learn that even if a doctor supports me that it likely will not be approved. I know it's my own fault I've wound up here but I can't even get out of bed, how can I work? I have councelling starting this week but my mind needs some time to be calm and after talking to the insurance I've been in like full panic mode for so long I just want to be able to calm down. Everyone wants to know when I think I will return to work and I feel like I cant and if I am forced to.... I'll feel even worse about myself and what I've been going through and how I'm failing and I just feel like I need time and everyone surely thinks I'm taking advantage:( sometimes I cant even breath and this is literally all I think about.

I don’t know if this stems from not feeling good enough but I always feel selfish for wanting to spend time with my boyfriend. Like I’m taking away from his alone time or time he could be doing something more important.

Like he has Thursday and Friday off this week. I went round last night as I often do during the week when he finishes work (I normally see him once after work and then the weekend every week) anyway tomorrow is the anniversary of our first kiss. I’m pretty sure he doesn’t even know this and probably wouldn’t be that fussed if I told him (not really into soppy stuff) anyway it’s kinda important to me and I want to spend the day with him but in my head I keep thinking “no it’s his first day off leave him alone, don’t ruin him having time to himself” so now idk what to do because I want to see him but feel sad because what if I’m just being selfish?"
2440,Anxiety,I really just wish people were a little more compassionate,I don’t have much else to say. I’m just tired.
2441,Anxiety,"I feel like i’m living in a bad dream, the past two years have brought me nothing but heartache, ANXIETY, depression and bipolar. I desperately need somebody to talk to and help me but with everything going on it’s so hard.","Ever since my ex left me in april of 2019, life has been one shitstorm after the next. The last 4 months have felt like i’m living in a simulation, simply watching life pass me by. And the life that is passing me by is getting worse and worse and less like what i want.

I’m by no means an addict but i am surrounded by a social circle where the norm is to binge drink and take recreational drugs. I’m 25, have a steady job, live at home with my mother still. At some points i feel great and like i have a plan. Low points hit, like this morning, where i got so shitfaced lastnight and completely forgot who i was. I’m now sat in work feeling horrendous and i’m sat here asking myself why i did that.

Is that even me? I don’t want to be that person any more but it’s like i have no self control. My ex broke things off with me a week after terminating her early pregnancy. I cried my eyes out every day 2 months straight. This is when things started to spiral and i would start to throw myself into situations where i could get as fucked up as possible to numb the pain which only caused more issues with my mental. The termination still pains me to my core as i see my friends all getting on with their lives, settling down and having kids. My closest friend of the last 10 years announced he was expecting lastnight and we had a few drinks to celebrate. Something in me subliminally made me take it too far as i hooned up the last line at 2am and stumbled home out of my face.

With everything that’s going on with the pandemic, and my country going into a second lockdown, i feel so lonely and lost in my thoughts. I don’t like the person who i am, who i have been or who i am becoming. Nothing is as i thought i would be. I just want someone to love me and make me feel like i’m not a worthless piece of human garbage. 

The anxiety is crippling. I’m so worried about what my future holds and what my place in this world is. I’m so unhappy with the way things are right now and i simply don’t know where to turn. My mind flickers from this to terrible decisions ive made over the past year, people i have hurt and all the things i have done that can’t be taken back. I don’t know whether to take a step back in distance myself from everyone or reach out to somebody for help.

As i’m writing this i’m worried about what will happen tonight, tomorrow, next week. What happens when this hangover and come down wares off. And i feel okay again and then leap into another booze/drug fuelled nightmare. I feel like lastnight was a wake up call for me that this isn’t the right path that i’m on. That i need to learn some self control. I just feel so fucking broken and empty. I don’t know why this beautiful life has become so horrible and miserable for me.

I have secret anxiety coughing attacks when with friends and we’re going somewhere. We were walking lastnight and i was just at the back coughing away, almost being sick because i’m anxious. What is that? Why am i so unsure of myself and worried about everything. I couldn’t pinpoint what i’m so anxious about, i just am.

I feel like life has just been one let down after another up until this point. I’ve never gotten what i wanted...it’s always been just out of reach. I had a taste of it but it was ripped away from me and now i just fucking hate myself for not being able to hang onto it.

I’m scared, please help."
2442,Anxiety,Started Zoloft Looking for Advice,"Hi all, this is my first time taking any type of antidepressant and I'm looking for advice. 

I was prescribed 25mg of Sertraline. I know people say the first two weeks can be rough and make everything feel worse, but Jesus I am only on Day 2 and feel terrible. 

Soon after taking it I get the lump in throat feeling like something is stuck in there. I know it is not, I can breathe and swallow normally but it is really freaking me out and uncomfortable. 

I'm also getting racing thoughts and everything feels really overwhelming. I have to get up in 20 minutes to get the kiddo ready for school and I feel stuck. 

People who have taken it before what are some things that can help? And does it really get better after this initial hump? Please just remind me it's all in my head. Thank you ❤️"

2444,Anxiety,Can we just have a round of applause for restaurants that post their menus online,"It's sooooo much easier going to a restaurant/café/fast food joint/whatever (for the first time) when you can check out the contents and prices of their menus beforehand, and this especially comes in handy to my socially anxious peeps. Sometimes I see a restaurant that looks promising, but I chicken out because I like to have my order locked and loaded before even setting foot at the place.

Also, this doubles as a plea to all restaurants- if you didn't alreday do it, I'M BEGGING YOU please post your menus online, whether on your website, your IG story highlights, or in an album on Facebook."
2445,Anxiety,In elementary school when we would have to read out loud to the class from the textbook I would literally count the kids in front of me and figure out what section I was reading so I could practice it before it got to my turn &amp; I think that’s where my anxiety started,
2446,Anxiety,I'm probably getting a job and the anxiety is killing me,"So my dad is friends with a man who works for the local government. He told this man that I'm about to graduate from college which isn't true at all. Because of my anxiety I'm struggling a lot and a 4 year degree is taking me a lot longer. Anyway, this man took interest in me because they need someone who is about to graduate from my career and I'm the only person he knows of (it's a very niche career), so he is coming to my house today to talk to me about my qualifications.

Thanks to my dad who never went to college and doesn't understand how it works, this man thinks I'm like a semester away from graduation, when I'm like at least 2 (3 counting this current semester that ends in three weeks) semesters away from graduation. And because of my anxiety I'm terribly ashamed of my grades, which he wants to see.

I look at the courses I've taken and all I see is all the courses I'm missing. I'm more qualified for this job than most people around me, I'm very passionate about my career, I love it, but I feel unqualified, scared and ashamed to show people the education I have.

I should've graduated two years ago but because of anxiety it's taking me longer than most people. I used to start a class and drop it as soon as things got too difficult and I got too anxious. Now I'm finally able to take exams and get through a semester. Last semester I completed 2 in one (took a bunch of classes to make up for the lost time), this semester I'm doing something similar.

 I am ashamed of myself, the idea of explaining to this man that I'm not as close to graduation as he thinks makes me shake and tear up and my throat closes up and I feel like I'm about to throw up. Ever since my dad (proudly, bless his soul) told me he was ""getting me a job"" I've had a headache and ear pain that won't go away and I feel like crying from so much shame. I feel like a disappointment. I don't know what to do."
2447,Anxiety,I can’t sleep because I feel like I can’t breathe,"Hey guys! So lately I’ve been having really bad anxiety and have been super stressed. I do take meds for depression but it seems like anxiety has sort of crept up on me a few years ago - in my late twenties. I have an appointment with my doc in a few weeks and I do plan to discuss with her.

Anyways, a few months ago I had my first full blown 2 l-hour long panic attack. It was triggered by the fact that I kept feeling like I couldn’t breathe. Now for the past few nights I’ve been having the same feeling, but only just when I start to fall asleep. I lay awake for hours, my mind racing about everything from chores to money to loved ones dying. It’s absurd and no matter what I do I can’t calm down. When I finally start to drift to sleep, I’m awoken by the sensation that I am not breathing. I literally can’t feel myself inhaling. I start to panic but then I realize what’s happening and make myself focus by using my pillow against my nose to feel the air moving (if that makes sense). Then I drift off and same thing! Over and over. I’m getting real tired (pun intended).

I can’t be alone, right?! Anyways, I was just looking to see if anyone has methods and/or ideas for managing anxiety at night. Or even dealing/coping with stress. I always wake up feeling better in the morning, but it’s starting to wear on me and I know it’s terrible for your body. Ugh!

Also, I do play puzzle games and read almost every night to calm myself."

2450,Anxiety,Everything feels like too much,"I just can't stop having nightmares. I had an anxiety dream last night that i was showing up to a job i don't have at what i thought was an early time only to be told i was 20 minutes late. Then i would try to do a task and i would take too long and be berated for it.
I can't even leave the house most days because the stream of what ifs that go through my head. 
Medication has helped to a degree, but i still get overwhelmed at everything. If i have to do a task, i'll put it off until the very last second. I can't even function at a workplace anymore. Even as I post on here i'm terrified someone I know will see this and try and talk to me about it or think i'm faking it.
I keep having panic attacks weekly, sometimes daily. I just want to feel better.

I'm sorry for the long post, i don't even know what to ask for. I guess i'm just a little lost right now."

2453,Anxiety,Does anyone know why I would need an abdominal ultrasound after blood testing?,"Had missed calls from the hospital and my Gastro right after getting blood tests yesterday. Called this morning and the front desk lady didn’t know anything about my blood test results but I think she didn’t know I didn’t know anything about apparently needing to schedule an abdominal ultrasound/sonogram, which she said is what the nurse might have been calling about? Honestly freaking the hell out waiting for the nurse to come in and call me back. What is this testing used for? I keep seeing stuff about tumors and cancer and also stuff like an enlarged spleen and I’m having a major panic attack. I just need someone to tell me its not as serious as I think it is?"
2454,Anxiety,My worst irrational fear came true and I don’t know how to move on,"Since I was a really little kid I’ve feared windows and my house at night. No clue where it came from, but I’ve been terrified of my windows at night as well as break-ins/men I don’t know being in my house at night. 
It took my entire life, up until leaving for college, to let go of that. Then, about two months ago, my neighbor with Alzheimer’s started to look through my windows and /try/ to enter my house at night. 
I emphasize, but honestly and selfishly it is putting my mental health in the gutter.  
I can no longer pass by any windows at night. I have cats who sometimes pull my curtains down so I nailed all of the curtains to the window sills. Plus a blanket cover for each so it’s impossible to see through. 
But I’m still have panic attacks at night when I have to use the bathroom or want a snack. 

TLDR: scared of men looking through my window since I was a child, that happened but reasonably, can’t move on."
2455,Anxiety,Meditation against anxiety disorder,Is meditation Helpful against anxiety disorder?  Should i practice it or just go on with progressive muscle relaxation?
2456,Anxiety,Doctor asked me to go in for a blood test/bloodwork. The anxiety is so bad I've decided not to go but it’s still killing me.,"I'm blood and needle phobic to a ridiculous level. Whenever I see blood or have an injection, I tend to pass out. My GP knows I've got severe depression and anxiety but because I keep feeling tired, she asked me to go for a blood test - however thinking about it, the tiredness is likely because of depression and the drugs I’m on not working. That’s another story - but I don’t think I need it as I’ve nearly resolved the tired thing. 

However, I literally cannot bring myself to go because I’m nervous of passing out or having a panic attack in the waiting room (it’s walk-in). But then I think ‘Jesus, it’s just a blood test, just go!’ 

My anxiety is doing cartwheels in my mind and I feel physically sick. It’s made worse by me thinking I’m sort of abject failure by being this anxious, having the phobia and being too scared to go - as well as if my doctor will think my anxiety/depression is a lie because I don’t want to get a blood test and what on Earth do I say to her about not going. This is then impacting my day job because I can’t concentrate at all because of the massive anxiety and keep staring at the request forms sitting on my desk thinking ‘holy shit why are you so afraid?’ 

I’ve had a blood test before in the emergency bit of the hospital many years ago - and I hated it. Got through it but that was one vial to be drawn whereas this is three. 

Any tips on how to calm the anxiety down? I’m not going for the test as a) I don’t think it’s needed as the reason for it is no longer there and b) the city I’m in is technically going to be in a lockdown so don’t want to risk going to a rather busy facility unless I really need to. But even though I’ve decided I’m not going, the anxiety is killing me..."
2457,Anxiety,Panic Attacks and the feeling of being trapped in your head. Please read this.,"Hey guys, 2 months back I had my first panic attack, which transformed into a full day of panic attacks and anxiety which landed me in the hospital as I thought I was dying. The following weeks I had some dissociation symptoms from this traumatic event. I´m finally feeling like myself more and more again. All I got left is my memory of what happened to me and it´s kind of crippling me to move forward. 

However what´s bothering me is that everytime I watch a movie for example I can´t fully concentrate on it as I´m constantly analyzing my attention span and think about how I can´t let go of what happened and in reality, this is the thing, that is holding me back to pay attention. Same when I´m with friends. I feel good whenever I´m around them and can share some really nice moments and emotions with them but most of the time my head goes: ""Why can´t you let go?"", ""Get out of you head"", ""I just want to forget what has happened to feel like I´m in the moment again"". But these thoughts are the only thing keeping me away from being in the moment, you know? Sounds very paradox, but I thought maybe you could understand what I´m saying. 

I feel kind of trapped in my head and in a constant loop of thoughts but the loop´s only content is that I am feeling trapped in a loop of thought and can´t be in the moment and like I said these thoughts are the only thing that keep me from being in the moment. Like I can´t let my thoughts just be there as before but kind of want to take control of them, even tho whenever I do it, my thoughts turn against me and push me further away from the moment. 

I guess my biggest problem is just that I want to make myself forget about all of these things, which is not possible, as I can‘t forget about it as long as I‘m still thinking about it haha. 

I also have that weird feeling that I can‘t ever get fully over it as everything in my life will constantly remind you of all of these things. Like I wanna move on but can‘t because once I was in this overthinking state for a few months, everything around me or just songs, movies and everything I once loved got connected to all of these feelings and thoughts and they will constantly remind me of my past. All of this is such a weird experience really.

I hope you got any idea of what I´m saying. I know probably all of this sounds not so bad, but it‘s really fucking me up. I feel like I‘m so dumb because of this as I can‘t get out of my head and think about anything external really and I‘m afraid that this will keep me from going to university or getting a good job later on as I just can‘t pay attention. It‘s really crippling me and making me depressed from time to time. Not to sound arrogant, but I always was a smart boy before this and now I‘m so afraid that I won‘t be able to use my abilities for good as I‘m trapped in my head forever.

I just wanna go back to the person I was 2 months ago, I wasn‘t even like a super happy person or anything like that but at least I didn‘t feel so lost in my head and not everyday felt the same, with the same thoughts going through my head day in and day out. I feel so dumb for knowing what my problem is but just not being able to let go. 

Do you have any tips for me on how to overcome this? Or did anyone of you had a similar situation going on? 

Anyway, have a good day, people. I wish you the best :)"
2458,Anxiety,ANXIETY HEADACHES,"I have been on 10 mgs for 3.5 weeks and still have high anxiety, decreased libido, headaches and tiredness.

2459,Anxiety,"How to respond to ""what do you need"" questions?","Hi everyone, I have been struggling lately with just overall constant worry, anxiety, and the ""doom"" feeling. I'm not entirely sure what is making it more intense than my already-intense ""normal"" state, but I just can't shake the intensity over the past few days. I regularly talk to my boyfriend about how I'm feeling and he's very supportive. However, I've been noticing a real flaw in myself recently when he asks what I need or how he can help. I just say ""I don't know."" There is not a single thing I can imagine that would help and I so much appreciate his support, but I know it gets tiring for him to constantly listen and ask to help me and get that in response. It's like my brain turns off (aside from the anxious part) and I don't remember what I like, what makes me happy, etc. It's so frustrating.

I guess my question for anyone who reads this is what do you say or feel when someone asks you how they can help? Of course just being there helps a bit, but is there anything that you've found productive if someone else is offering to give their time to you to aid in helping your anxiety? Any feedback is greatly appreciated!! Thank you :)"
2460,Anxiety,My therapist mentioned anxiety medication today and I’m crying.,"My therapist mentioned anxiety medication today and I’m crying.

I’m 22 and for as long as I can remember I haven’t really felt things. In my life, decisions are hard to make, when u have anxiety basically anxiety turns off your logical mind. Since I have a decently high level of anxiety it’s turned off a lot and it can make it really hard for me to think and I always feel stressed from the moment I wake up till I go to bed. It’s been for this for a kinda long time now.

In therapy my therapist often ask me how I feel and to put words on my emotions. But I just cant.. I zone out a lot as well due to anxiety.

I’m on my way home atm from my therapist and I know once I get inside I’ll break down crying. 

I just wanna be normal, normal as not needing medication and feeling fine. (Who doesn’t)

I asked if it’s the only way, but he said there’s things still to try. Even if the logical thing is to try that first and if it doesn’t work out go on medication, I just don’t want to even tho I know it is the right thing to do if so.

I don’t know.. I feel low right now after he mentioned it, makes me realise how “sick” I might actually be.
*crying*

My hopes are that if I can manage to make some friends or and get a relationship (not wanting to rely on a boyfriend, but rather having one to share experiences/feel loved/love. I guess...) my life will become better and help me.
I haven’t had a friend since I was 18. I been isolating when not working and playing games.

Any input is appreciated."
2461,Anxiety,Reduced anxiety from taking mushrooms,"I was diagnosed with GAD 8 years ago but have always suffered from it since I was young. It's taken a lot of time but with therapy and medication, it's gotten a lot better from where it was. However, over the last couple weeks, I found myself having more anxiety leading to depressive symptoms as well. About a week ago, I decided to take mushrooms just for the experience. I'm not really a recreational drug user but it's always something I wanted to try. 

The trip was mesmerizing. I remember just sitting there and seeing a water bottle expand in size and then shrink. I remember just seeing things more vividly and watching the new Borat movie was amazing as well. There were sometimes I was thinking about past memories and bad thoughts about myself started creeping in. I came down and eventually went to sleep. 

When I woke up the next morning, I felt alive and energized. It was weird given how I'd been feeling recently. Since then, my anxiety has greatly reduced and I just feel at peace. I usually wake up in the morning with a sense of dread but ever since then, I haven't.

Has anyone had similar experience with this?"
2462,Anxiety,I think my fiancé just wants excuse to leave me,Today my fiancé told me he wants small wedding rather than big one. It was ok with me. We want to organize it in my country and not his now. Anyway he said he invited his family too but he requested to me that my family should give him 1K for his relative because he ran out of cash for the wedding and his parents flight. What is odd he told me if we can find way for the 1K he will break up. He said the wedding was already delayed with months and he wants real relationship now. If he didn't had enough money he should have saved from something else I am beyond hurt. I am not sure if my family would like to spare anything Amyway In the morning we had fought for something else and he said he is extremely mad. Can this be the result for his words. Thoughts

2464,Anxiety,dae imagine they’re being watched by people?,"idk if this is classified as anxiety but i figured it was the closest

literally ever since i was a kid i’ve compulsively imagined i was being watched by random people like my peers or friends or celebrities even where basically i just imagine they’re invisible and watching everything i do (i know there’s no one actually there) and imagine how they’d react to every little thing i do and basically adjust my personality depending on the person i imagine is watching me. for example if i imagine one of my friends is watching me and they hate the tv show i’m watching i change it to something i know they’d like even if i hate it cuz it makes me uncomfortable to think they’d have a negative opinion about me (even though ik they’re not actually there)

it’s gotten a point recently where if i’m watching a tv show and i’m not wearing like a full face of makeup with my hair done i start imagining the actors are watching me thinking things like “this is the kind of ugly person that watches my show?” or something and i literally will have to turn off the show cuz i get so uncomfortable and i just realized i used tv shows for both examples but it can happen with anything like the food i eat or the music i listen to or how i talk

obviously every time it happens i try to get it out of my head but i kinda normally just have to wait it out i feel like there’s nothing i can do to prevent it and it’s really annoying"

2467,Anxiety,COVID Anxiety,"My COVID anxiety is ruining my life. Even now, I feel a tightness in my chest. I google my symptoms daily, even though I already know all of them by heart. My health anxiety was already very bad before this, due to a bad immune system and 3 months of strep. About a month back I got bronchitis, I was having a hard time breathing, the sickest I’ve been in years. This created a whole new realm of anxiety I hadn’t experienced yet: breathing anxiety. 

I will convince myself that the smallest cough or irritation is COVID. I will spiral myself into a panic attack, convince myself that I have a stuffy nose or that I can’t breathe the same way I usually can. I’m currently on day 3 of a panic attack. It ebbs and flows, but remains. I’ll have 30 minutes of heart racing, mind boggling, chest tightening, fear. 5 minutes of calm. With good normal breathing, no chest tightness. And then? I start to panic again. That I won’t be able to breathe. That I can’t breathe. My poor boyfriend has been a rock through this. He’s doing a wonderful job of convincing me that I am in fact fine and distracting me from my thoughts. But god, I feel like such a burden because I can’t seem to get my anxiety under control. 

I need help. I need advice. I need to go through a day without hyperventilating and crying because I feel like I can’t breathe. If anyone has any advice, is going through the same thing, please let me know. I don’t know what to do anymore."

My anxiety tends to manifest as an upset stomach, complete with cramping, hot and cold flashes, and all the other one-run trappings of a stomach bug.

I have this 'little' problem that I don't know what to do about, it's about a bladder problem, so kinda started a few years ago in winter, when I came back from school (PE to be exact) I went to wash my hands, and without even feeling the need to pee, I peed myself, I didn't think anything of it, but the next year it also happened, the same way as last year, after pe ,washing my hands and Bam, so this happened 1/2 times in a year, but then the big problem happened, and it was that after getting out of the bathroom, it happened as well, I didn't even feel the need to pee so I don't understand why, it developed this fear in me that I might pee myself, at first it was just near water, and it didnt bother my everyday life like sleeping and studying, but then this year it got worse, I was worried all the time, near water, after drinking water, even going to sleep, and thinking about peeing make me have a feeling I might pee myself and makes me go running to the bathroom, I had to distract myself from thinking about it ( usually by singing a song in my head), but it was fine because I didn't have to go anywhere,I didn't have school because of quarantine,so I just stayed inside for the whole 8 months, but now I can't, because school reopened and I have to get out of my comfort zone and move around, where there is no bathroom near me (because our school is shitty and doesn't even have a proper bathroom, it's utterly filthy), today is the first day, it was okay in the morning because they sent us home, but in the afternoon, I was sitting on my chair, there was no teacher around and we had to wait inside class, when all of a sudden, I felt like I need to pee,I didn't know what to do, I felt my legs shaking, I was stressing, I was almost in tears, I stood up awkwardly to check if I really have to, but sat down quickly because I was too scared, it felt like I will pee myself any moment, when someone came and told us we can go home because we don't have classes today, I got up as soon as they left and started walking home, and guess what, that feeling left as I was nearing home, I didn't tell anyone about this, but my mom knows about the accidents and told me it was fine and that this happens to most people especially females in winter ( I'm a female), and that it was only because of my period ( which I think is kinda true because these accidents happened a few days before my period), but she doesn't know about my fear and stress, and I'm worried this fear will make me unable to focus on my studies and school, and will ruin my everyday life, is this really going to be my life from now on?

What I am now asking is, will going to the doctor and getting a check up on my bladder help or is this fear related to anxiety and has nothing to do with the health of my bladder?

I'm very sorry about the long post."

Im a senior and i work part time. Both in And out of school I avoid things, procrastinate if its a really big project. I always get easy homework / projects/emails out of the way asap. But if its something bigger or an email that requires more explanation, i get nervous about the response and what the other person will think and i always think they’ll be mad at me - which they are not at the time - they DO get mad understandably when I dont respond for a week+. 

I recently messed up in communicating with my manager at work about my sick leave. I was out for a week and genuinley thought i sent an email updating him about returning to work  and doctors clearance (which we now need when returning to work with any illness because of Covid). He called me very annoyed today because its been 5 days without any communication - then i realized i never sent the email - which had taken me 2 days to write btw).  I was planning on asking him for a reccomendation letter in a few months for grad school but i think that Is out of the question now. 

I do the same thing with school - i avoid responding to my professors emails when its something more pressing/ about an assignment or if i request an extension. I will literally get so anxious about even opening my email app to see their name. I just logged in for the first time in a week to see 2 emails from a professor about an assignment i had missed.

Honestly - im worried and freaking myself out. Im lucky i even still have a job , but more than that im still worried that everyone hates me - which at this point they probably do

tldr. I feel sick all the time, i get anxious about how people will respond, i avoid communication until its so bad that it blows up in my face."

I've had 2 seizures from stress in the last 24 hrs (I have epilepsy) and I'm riding a fucking rollercoaster of emotions.

All that being said, we all just need to remember that our country and society is ever changing. We're always moving towards a bigger picture and usually the ethical side wins one way or another. Supporters on both sides have reasons they think are justified and it doesn't make them shitty people. We're all trying to survive and we'll get through it together. Maybe we'll see another wave of young protestors pushing for change. Who knows. 

After all this is over we won't judge based on what person someone voted for. We'll judge if they're a shitty person regardless of how that trait manifests. 

Keep breathing. This will be over soon enough. In the meantime do some self-care today. I'm gonna do we yoga, meditate, write in my journal, go for a walk and maybe read a book at the park. What are you going to do today to take care of yourself?"
2479,Anxiety,Free and easy to use mental health resources I’ve found useful for anxiety,"Given everything that’s happening in the world I thought I’d share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn’t a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it’s relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I’ve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There’s so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I’ve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I’ve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I’m a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn’t your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn’t include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/) \- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you’re at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn’t try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It’s like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What’s Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you’re looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design. Aimed at people looking to reduce symptoms of anxiety."
2480,Anxiety,An impulsive need to face an anxiety indosing situation out of self shaming and then maybe ending up with an anxiety attack.,"I'm kind of just wondering if im the only one who overthinks anxious scenarios and shames myself into self destructive behavior through this pattern. I will over think the anxiety indosing situation for days and eventually it will bother me so much that i end up doing it and that's when it all goes wrong.

I've been telling myself for months, STOP REPEATING THIS CYCLE ! but, i always find myself back there again."

2482,Anxiety,I need help with deciding if I should change schools :/,"So I’m 14 and live in London and I attend secondary school.

For my first year,I attended one about a mile away,which I’ll call C-school since the area it’s located starts with a c.The school I’m at now,I’ll call P-School for the same reason.

So C-School I attended for almost a year.I had made quite a lot of really good friends and I was quite happy.The downside is the uniform-we have to wear grey and pink blazers and us girls are only allowed to wear trousers.We have to use the plain black school backpacks and were not allowed makeup or hair accessories.I’ll have to take two busses to get there too.But to be honest,my best friend who I talk to everyday attends it and I love him a lot,I don’t talk to my other friends too much but we keep in touch on social media and before I left we were very close.We had a lot of fun and the teachers were quite alright,I learned a lot and there weren’t a lot of disruptions.We dont get any non-uniform days but idrm.

P-School,I started I think,July last year.I finished year 7 there and i was pretty popular off the bat.I remember my first day where I was being shown one of the playgrounds and I got stuck at the necked since the whole courtyard had gathered around me to look.People were standing on benches and stuff and it was pretty scary.After that,I made a few friends and sort of went through the most ions.I never really settled in and after almost two years,I still feel new.I still feel sick to my stomach the night before and on the way to school like it’s my first day.I don’t think I’ve really learned anything,mostly because the teachers have to spend the whole hour trying to get unruly kids into their seats and they flat out refuse to cooperate.They smash chairs against the walls,smoke,do weed,ditch class in the toilets and climb on tables.They throw paper around and have water fights.This means they have to strip down in the middle of class and hang their shirts and skirts out the window.I’m not allowed to choose my language class,I don’t get any work done and the teachers care about makeup than our safety.There’s regular stabbings at the bus stop I walk past and the teachers make me uncomfortable.I don’t have any friends since quarantine put me in a severe depressive state where I stopped talking to everyone.Then during my sensors week back my best friends spread rumours about me which gave me a panic attack and made me cry.I have to sit next to here in most my classes and I don’t really talk to anyone else.I find it so,so hard to talk to people.Even a girl I know said recently that ‘I still feel new’.The plus of this school is the uniform regulations aren’t as strict,it takes me about two minutes to walk there and we get regular non uniform days and late starts.It’s an older building and looks nicer,and it isn’t on a main road.

I mainly don’t want to be a bother to my mum.I just got new uniform and pe kit,and I don’t have my old uniform.I feel so selfish for changing all the time and I don’t want to make my mum pay for my uniform.

I don’t know what to do.I’m genuinely about to cry because I’m supposed to go into school tomorrow and I have food tech .In that class I sit next to my ex best friend and I don’t know anyone else and I can’t bring myself to talk to her after what she did.I’m so scared and I feel like throwing up.I don’t know who I’ll hang out with at break or walk to lunch with.I’m so scared.Please,please help.I don’t know what to do.

Any help or advice would be really really appreciated &lt;3"

2485,Anxiety,I'm exhausted today,"I know a lot of people are stressed out over this election but honestly I didn't think I was going to be one of them. I maybe watched an hour or two of election coverage yesterday and then did my usual bedtime routine, but fuck... I couldn't sleep. I was exhausted, yawning non-stop, but it still took me 3 hours of rolling around in bed to fall asleep, and even then I kept waking up throughout the night. I had no clue what was really keeping me up last night since I ended my night with some random happy videos. That was until I woke up and realized the first thing I wanted to do was check the results. To no surprise, it's still inconclusive which means I might be in for another night of restlessness. I hate the fact that this shit sits deep inside and creeps up when I least expect it. I hate that this still bothers me when it's not even at the forefront of my thoughts. That's all."
2486,Anxiety,"I know this probably isn’t the place to ask this but I’m wondering something. I feel like I have a shortness of breathe due to corona virus and I can’t stop panicking. I can do a full deal breathe, so I’m wondering if I have a shortness of breathe or I’m just overthinking",
2487,Anxiety,I feel like I'm falling apart and I have no one to turn to.,"I started taking Lexapro recently to treat my GAD, and its been okay for a couple weeks but last night I woke up a lot completely panicked, my thoughts were jumbled and I felt like I was losing my mind. I've been so tired this morning and feel like I have this huge weight on top of me, I feel so sad and scared. My boyfriend is usually really supportive, but he's traveling for work and when I try to talk about how I'm feeling it just seems to turn into a fight where it feels like he just thinks I'm acting this way to make him feel bad. If something he does or says upsets me, even if it's completely unintentional on his part, he just says ""okay im sorry, ill do better"" thats it. It doesn't really feel like he tries to understand. He's having a really hard time lately and he feels too much pressure from me at times like this, I don't think he has the emotional capacity to fully support me right now. I feel really bad for him and wish I could just be fine and not put unnecessary strain on our relationship. 

The only other person I could talk to is my best friend but she's taking care of her mother who's going to pass away any day now, all while still working on her PhD. I can't bring myself to complain to her about my problems. So I have no one at the moment. I keep breaking out into tears and feeling so sad and anxious while I'm at work, and I wanna go home but I'm honestly so afraid to be alone. I have to figure out how to be okay and get through this on my own. 

All I can do is try to hold on and hope tomorrow is a better day. How are you guys doing? Today is probably stressful for a lot of people, so I guess at least I'm not alone in that."
2488,Anxiety,is this my anxiety? or is it rational? i still refuse to hang out w friends and go to places unnecessarily,"i live in a city that has 400+ cases a day... we are just down to that from 3000 cases a day.. not in the state, THE CITY. I suffer from anxiety and OCD which makes me question if my actions are logical and realistic or just root from my fear.

I keep refusing to hang out w my friends and everyone thinks im exaggerating. I do the healthy things like go out to buy the things i need, go for walks, the beach, etc. Except i do everything on my own because im scared of being too close to anyone but my family. It has come to the point where people have stopped taking precautions and make me feel ridiculous.

I live with my two old grandparents and Im immunocompromised myself. Idk if this is my anxiety or is just my mental illness? people acting like everything is okay and normal while people die make me feel so helpless"
2489,Anxiety,Anyone else experience this?!?!,"Ok, this is a serious question, but laughing is totally welcomed. Does anyone here every have  panic attacks that make you have EXPLOSIVE shits and then once you are done pooping, the panic attack is over?? Like, a lot of times, i know my panic attack is almost over when either A) I start shaking uncontrollably or B) i shit my fucking brains out."
2490,Anxiety,How to be confident?,"I have generalized anxiety and some OCD. This has been manifesting in the last 10 years in career jumping / job hopping. I've changed career directions 2 times and many jobs. I want to feel confident in my career direction and decisions, but I always end up thinking that other people are making way more money doing what they're doing and I should've chosen a different line of work. I'm just getting tired of it at this point. I'm tired of listening to thing long-winded rant in my head about making the wrong choice, not making enough money, etc... I just want my mind to be confident, tell me what job I'll be happy at and make good living. and I'll just do it. Instead it's leading me in this circle goose chase."

AND IF IM SILENT THEN I SIDE WITH THE OPPRESSOR BUT PLEASE IM SO MENTALLY ILL SERIOUSLY I CANT TAKE THE STRESS ANYMORE SO PLEASE PLEASE I JUST WANT A BREAK I FEEL SO OFTEN LIKE I FAIL AND FAIL


Politics are driving me insane I am so full of hate and it’s not okay because I know most liberals are quite sweet and they’re not all bad. But some of them. Oh my goodness. I’m so stressed about the election, about everything... I’m stressed about police brutality, about the ICE detention camps, they hurt my heart and it hurts even worse that I can’t do anything. I can do nothing yet doing nothing is deemed as bad. I’m so stressed out. The politics won’t stop coming— everywhere I go there’s no avoiding them. I don’t want to be a leftist anymore but I don’t wanna be conservative either. I want to be nothing, not political at all, but not only can I not avoid it I’ll also feel like I’m doing something wrong..."
2493,Anxiety,I have a teacher this semester and he does something that makes me super anxious. Would emailing him about it be ridiculous?,"He’s one of my studio teachers, but sometimes he’ll randomly call someone out and make them answer the question. Sometimes it’s while you’re seated and sometimes you’ll have to come up to the board. 

Anyways, this makes me so anxious. I get super sweaty palms, I shake, I feel like I can’t breathe and it feels like my heart is gonna jump out of my chest. Would it be ridiculous to email him about it especially since I’m in college? If it’s not how should I even explain it? It’s my first year of college"
2494,Anxiety,Separation anxiety,"Does any of you deal with separation anxiety so severe that you cant even go out? And if so, how?

Short version is that my mother is moving to another country and I really cant deal with it, i've tried my medications, i've tried thinking that I can always contact her. But not being able to just take the bus for 15 minutes and seeing her just absolutely crushes me, she's my best friend and a great mother. I have barely slept, had tons of nightmares, cant go to work because I just collapse and cry and if I get too stressed my epileptic seizures kick in."
2495,Anxiety,I got anxiety when my friend had a plan to do better for himself,I was talking to a friend of mine. He is kinda not in the best place of his life right now. Neither am I. He talked about how he had at least had a plan to do better for himself. He said he had a friend talk to him about budgeting and how he's gonna start journaling. I was so happy to hear that he was gonna do things to better himself. Out of nowhere I felt a surge of anxiety. Im breathing harder and and crying.  I worry that I'm having a negative reaction to his betterment. Which I feel makes me toxic or not a good friend. Or that I'm anxious that I have no plan or way to better myself from my nothing life. That I'll be sad and alone and scared forever
2496,Anxiety,I start my new job tomorrow!,"I haven’t worked since I graduated college about a year ago, and I start tomorrow. I’m really nervous but I’m going to have a good day."
2497,Anxiety,Tired,"Probably gonna delete this. Every day’s a struggle. No, I can’t go to therapy because I can’t afford it, yes I know there’s free counseling resources online and I’ve tried but it hasn’t helped me. Ironically 95% of my anxiety is about finances, having grown up dirt poor and probably never going to break the cycle of poverty while I’m alive. It’s just really hard to function."
2498,Anxiety,Having to make decisions that will impact my future makes me incredibly stressed out and physically sick.,"I never realized this until recently, but having to make important decisions about my life/future makes me incredibly stressed out and anxious to the point it physically makes me sick. I can’t tell you how many times I have switched my college major, and even my university, just in the past year. Trying to decide what is the correct path for me in relation to the career I will have for the rest of my life is absolutely terrifying. What if I make the wrong decision and hate the field I go into? What if I can’t find work? All of the time and money I’ve spent in college would have been a complete waste. A lot of the time I think about just leaving college altogether because the stress and uncertainty is too much to bear. I genuinely wish I had someone making these decisions for me and just telling me that I have to stick with whatever they decide. I know that sounds lame and very codependent, but it would relieve so much of my stress and make me much happier. Seriously, I can’t even decide what to watch on Netflix after 30 minutes of scrolling through every single category, how can I be trusted to make big life-altering decisions?"
2499,Anxiety,"Got a big test tomorrow, I had a panic attack while studying for...how fun...","Got a big test tomorrow, I had a panic attack while studying for...how fun...

It does not help that I have ADHD and depression on top of anxiety. I need to pass the exam to get my biology degree. Yes I get a 2nd chance but I want to pass first go so I wouldn't have to worry about it again. Please wish me luck!"
2500,Anxiety,Going to seek therapy,"I’m lucky to have insurance and I feel I need help b/c my anxiety has increased. I don’t want it to take over my life and I don’t want to feel like I’m a failure n burden to anyone, fiancée family friends. Never had a therapist or what do I need ?? I’m not oppose to medication along w/life style changes. Psychologist or therapist ? What are some things to keep in mind? I feel like I’m going to cry as soon as I walk in for help."
2501,Anxiety,Anxiety is to the point that I'm (basically) mentally incapable of talking to unfamiliar people.,"Story time!! Around a year ago, my last ex (whom I loved very much) completely ditched me, backed stabbed me and lied behind my back to the friends I met with them. Because of two small misunderstandings in the past, when I was trying to show care.  


About 10 months ago, I almost had ptsd and was having repeated nightmares for the first time and ended up venting for months and months (and """"gained"""" another ex because of that, hahaha), all due to extreme mental pressure put on me with everyone abandoning me in the end, almost literally.  


Since then, I've only made a few new friends and anymore there's been a growing distance and I'm back to square one.  


I have all these ideas and things I'd love to do but I can't because it requires the support I don't get enough of, I have a friend I can rely on but even his own girlfriend is at odds with me, which makes me a bit more anxious as the days go on.  
I've tried talking in new places and stuff (doesn't help that I'm limited to the internet, and no not because of covid), but it's really hard to because of all this anxiety, I've planned for almost 2 years to do something and haven't done it yet because I'd need to be around people for a long time, and to always have confidence in myself and I really just wanna feel the warmth again honestly.. Idk"

Welp scheduled time with therapist, here we go again..."
2504,Anxiety,comfort room,"I have this bad habit of saying “I want to go home” even when i’m at home whenever I over think or get anxious about anything especially school. Growing up, the only place I felt safe was locked away in my room, not worrying about the future or stressing over anything but now that I’m growing older, there’s so many things i have to worry about. I just want to disappear or stay locked up in my room."
2505,Anxiety,Anticipatory anxiety,Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with anticipatory anxiety? I have a flight tomorrow and I always get so nervous before and a little bit during it. Just leading up to take off freaks me out so much. Thanks!!!
2506,Anxiety,Does sport help you deal with mental/emotional exhaustion?,"I feel like when I’m emotionally tired because of stress/anxiety, the only way I can stop that feeling is by getting physically exhausted.

Hey guys. I’m a 17 year old female and I’m going through a really rough patch right now with anxiety/depression. Every single relationship or “boy interest” I’ve had has fallen through In a toxic way. They never work out. I’m a shy, awkward person who loves old music/movies, history, and documentaries and boys don’t like that. I don’t want to change my personality but i dont know what else to do. Sometimes I break down and cry because I genuinely think nobody will ever truly like me. Sorry if this is serious I just needed to get it out."

2510,Anxiety,"Alcoholic father’s rampage and his lack of an apology + potential divorce = one stressed out high school senior who knows for a fact she won’t be able to attend school tomorrow without crying but who also has to attend her soccer game, how can she miss school but still be allowed to go to her game?","Long story short saturday was so bad that everyone had to leave the house while my mom stayed home and made it clear to my dad if he doesn’t get this under control(or at least actually try to instead of lying about trying), then she’ll divorce him.

Tbh idk how I feel about the potential divorce, I feel bad for my mom bc she puts up with his bs but I also feel bad for my dad bc I want him to know we love him it’s just that he has strained our relationships with him due to the alcohol, I also don’t know how I feel about the whole process of divorce with separate houses and all and the fact that my siblings’ and my favoritism towards our mother will become more noticeable bc nobody would want to visit my dads house if he’s drinking all the time.

Anyways that whole night was horrible and embarrassing given that my cousins were there and it was my uncle who had to take everyone including my crying little cousins out of the house. I was dreading the impending awkward apology I would get on sunday but it never happened, and idk how to feel about that bc for one I’m glad I didn’t have to listen to his bs apology but at the same time he didn’t even bother and instead acted like nothing happened. My younger sister is taking it badly too as she’s still up as I’m writing this and I heard her listening to a mental health video, she was the one my dad first started verbally attacking after she made a not serious comment so I don’t blame her for being upset especially since she didn’t understand what was going on the last time he got this drunk.

Idk how tf I can attend school tomorrow when I’m a sobbing mess just thinking about this, I have a soccer game though and that’s the one thing I can do that clears out my other worries but if I miss school I won’t be able to go. Ik for a fact if I go in tomorrow I will start sobbing before first period even starts so I’m wondering if I could possibly call in and ask if I could still go online and get in school credit so I’ll still be able to go to my game, but wtf am I gonna say “oh yeah my dad was cussing everyone out on saturday in a drunk rampage and he hasn’t bothered to apologize to anyone so now my mom is going to divorce him and I can’t handle that rn so pls let me go to my game but not be in in person school” like that is way too personal but idk how else I could be excused."
2511,Anxiety,I feel like I’m a captain blindly sailing new seas taking on risks so that sailors after me could learn from my experiences,"It’s currently 01:26 and I’m so antsy. I’m supposed to be studying for my test right now. I knew I had a test since last week. I knew that I had to finish my notes so that I could study. And yet I’m so freaking slow! It’s like my brain is a slug or something. I’m aware of what needs to be done but how do I do it? I’m constantly tired and my studies never soak in properly and stay there. I feel like a complete idiot. I just came off a gap year between high school and I just started uni. I have no idea what I’m doing and I feel like I’m just winging it. I want to try so hard but I just can’t. There’s so much going on in my mind but every time an issue comes up my instinct is to build a wall around it and walk away. I really love what I’m studying and I love my courses but it’s just so hard to grasp everything. It’s like a slippery bar of soap or something.


I feel like such a disappointment as the eldest child of 4. I’m supposed to set the example for my siblings but here I am, lying on the floor watching Victorian era history videos. Everyone has their eyes on me now. I’m the one that’ll receive all the questions from relatives asking about school. They’d ask me if I passed my CXC math exam that I rewrote this year. Everyone had such high hopes and I just failed. I wasted my parents money and time. All throughout primary school I’ve failed math. I barely managed a pass my school leaving exam with a 56% for math and 79% in English and somehow I got into one of the top schools in my country when it’s acceptance grades were 85%. Since then the acceptance grades went up to 95% to 100%. My year group made record high scores. People just clump me together with the rest and say “She’s so smart, she went to that rich/fancy private high school”. It’s so tiring. I’m not all that I’m chalked up to be. I did leave high school with 7/8 passes and that’s good but it’s because I sucked myself dry to the point of collapsing and almost ending my life. I was so sick during that time and I lost consciousness way more than I would’ve liked to. It was all so draining. My brother died during my exam period and I had to put on a facade of being strong. I’m not. I’m so fragile. It’s just eating me up. 


I’m so tired of being pushed, scolded and criticized for everything I do. As I get older and experience new things that my siblings would later experience I receive the worst end of how my parents deal with  whatever it is. Stop pushing me and stop with the underhand insults. Stop putting me up on a pedestal, I could barely keep my balance. When I fall off, everyone’s eyes would be on me. And everyone would just smile and say “It’s okay” but they know that they’re disappointed in me. They’re upset. Sorry I’m not what you want, jeez."
2512,Anxiety,I’m too scared to make friends,"Hi, I’ve struggled with anxiety and depression since I was in middle school and now I’m in my sophomore year of college. I moved away from my home town where I had a really great group of friends I more or less grew up with and never really developed the skills to meet new people. Now I am a recluse in college and I have no friends and I’m depressed, on top of that I’m starting to bad in school. I have a roommate who is even more socially awkward than I am and whenever I try to get him to come out with me to go meet people he always says “maybe another time” but he’s really just saying no. I see a bunch of people having a good time down by the pool of my apartment building and I want to go down but I always convince myself not to because I’ll get down there and be too scared to talk to anyone or I’ll be awkward and just go sit as far away as possible so I won’t seem weird or desperate despite the fact that I am desperate for friends. I just don’t know how to introduce myself, like I can’t just walk up to a group of ppl and act like I should be there right? Like if they’re all mingling and friendly already. But no one will just come up to me to try to get me to be their friend so I don’t really know what to do. I don’t have someone to help me meet people either. I ended up not having any friends freshman year and got really depressed until I got to go home for covid but now I can’t even go “home” to see my friends because I’ve moved to the other side of the country. I feel like if I had friends I would maybe try harder to stay in college since rn I just hate it and kinda wanna drop out even though I know it’s the wrong decision. Any advice?"

I just don’t know how to introduce myself, like I can’t just walk up to a group of ppl and act like I should be there right? Like if they’re all mingling and friendly already. But no one will just come up to me to try to get me to be their friend so I don’t really know what to do. I don’t have someone to help me meet people either. I ended up not having any friends freshman year and got really depressed until I got to go home for the (my post will get deleted if I mention it virus) but now I can’t even go “home” to see my friends because I’ve moved to the other side of the country. I feel like if I had friends I would maybe try harder to stay in college since rn I just hate it and kinda wanna drop out even though I know it’s the wrong decision. Any advice?"
2514,Anxiety,Giving myself rewards for completing tasks has been a game-changer.,"Why did I torture myself all these years lmao. I used to have the mindset that I only deserved a reward if I did everything I needed to do in the day ""perfectly."" Yeesh. My parents' toxic attitudes about productivity have been living in my head like a virus. 

Progress is progress is progress is progress. 

I love you btw."
2515,Anxiety,Driving Anxiety,"I’ve struggled with driving anxiety for quite some time, I’m twenty one and don’t have my license after taking the test twice before covid. I feel like my only option is drivers Ed, but even though I think about driving everyday my anxiety overpowers my motivation and I just don’t do it. Does anyone have any tips/their own experience with this that they could share with me? I just feel really stuck because I obviously can’t really go anywhere without a ride unless it’s walking distance and it’s so hard to not beat myself up."
2516,Anxiety,"I’m tired, Reddit","Quite honestly, I still think I need some real help, and not just squander off to Reddit whenever I get this anxious.

I’ve always been told to treat people the way you want to be treated. I’ve been in a really toxic friend group for some years now. I am constantly feeling judged everytime I do anything where I express my feelings/concerns. I am tired of feeling judged, I am tired of hearing other people constantly criticising others.

I feel as if I’m constantly shutting people away because of how I’ve been emotionally abused. I am tired of isolating myself just so I can exist peacefully."
2517,Anxiety,Rash?,"(21F, bipolar, BPD, panic disorder) I was having a panic attack and got a weird blotchy rash on my left arm/shoulder/chest that went away within a few minutes of appearing. Happen to anyone else? I’ve heard people talk about rashes due to anxiety but idk about it taking such a short time to go away."
2518,Anxiety,Having a horrible time with Proopanolol but don't know what else to do; please help!,"So my anxiety has recently become so unmanageable Ive decided to explore medication, specifically Propranolol. 

It worked wonders for 2 weeks, but now for the last 4 days I'm finding it impossible to sleep, at least on the first try. As soon as I reach that point between waking and sleep I'm not with a rush of panic and jolt awake in fear. I end up having to leave the room and cone back on later for a second try, which works.

I don't know what to do. I like how I feel the propanolol helps me control my anxiety when awake but I can't go on like this. I'm becoming terrified of my bedroom and dreading bedtime.   I'm so tired but my body won't let me sleep. It's maddening. 

Does anyone else have any recommendations for other drugs that are fast acting like propanolol but dont cause this soul crushing insomnia? Should I ask my doctor about Valium?"
2519,Anxiety,I’m scared my youth pastor thinks I’m mad at him (I know it’s stupid),"So I’m a leader for my youth group at my church and I was outside playing games and taking to other leaders as everything was getting ready. My youth pastor came up and for some reason I zoned out and just looked at him. And then me and him looked away AND I DONE IT AGAIN!!!! Why am I so dumb? 😂

I talked to him after I done that but I don’t want him to think he done something to make me mad or anything. Do you think I messed up? Or am I overthinking?"

2521,Anxiety,Trouble Sleeping Without My BF,"I’m having such a hard time falling asleep without my BF in bed with me. He’s been staying with me a lot recently but went back home, and I don’t feel comfortable or relaxed with out him. I don’t want to rely on him to sleep but I need some advice on how to calm down for bed. Intrusive thoughts are flooding my head and I wish I could just be next to him and he could calm me down. I just want to sleep :("
2522,Anxiety,Help?,"Well to keep things simple I haven’t had an easy life, kind of like everyone else here and I just wanted opinions to see how I could better myself for the future.

(I’m a 19 yo male btw)

Throughout middle and high school I’ve had to deal with a tremendous amount of anxiety and depression but as of recent both my anxiety and depression have hit levels that they’ve never reached before. My mother was a drug addict and my father was an alcoholic, I’ve lived with my mother all my life until she overdosed on heroin on my 17th birthday (yes, she’s still alive and im slowly working on repairing the very broken road that relationship is), now I live with my aunt. Living with my mother I was sheltered from the world in the worst ways possible because nothing could’ve prepared me for the world and how brutal it really is when you’re finished with high school. Throughout high school I was a very isolated person, I had a handful of friends and other than that I kept to myself (the entire 4 years) and now that I’m done with school my aunt told me I have to get a job or else she would throw me out of her house. I’ve submitted applications for things around me (I don’t have my drivers license or transportation to work other than walking) and I’m waiting for managers to get back to me but I haven’t received anything yet. The only places around me that I can work at within walking distance happen to be gas stations and my anxiety isn’t handling it so well. I’ve been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression disorders along with bipolar disorder, adhd and Ptsd from what my mother put me through. Whatever job I get will be my first ever actual job and my anxiety is ruining it for me completely. My thoughts go from being afraid that I’m going to get robbed at gunpoint to simply being afraid that I’m going to make many small mistakes leading up to me being fired and thrown on the streets. Even though that’s constantly on my mind I have another problem that isn’t just my anxiety, my depression has got to the point where I go literal full days without eating and it’s not anything I have any control over, I just don’t feel hungry much anymore and I keep forgetting to eat. It’s shocked me at first because I can get food ads on a day that I haven’t eaten and just act as a reminder that I should eat but never actually get around to eating and when I do eat I don’t get any enjoyment from it like I used to, I used to love the excitement behind trying a new dish and attempting new flavors but now everything seems so black and white and just boring. Idk. Sorry I made this so long for anyone that actually does take the time to read this. One final thing to add is I’m trying to get therapy for this but I haven’t found a therapist that I’m comfortable with and have confidence in so currently I’m not getting any actual help but I am working on it. So any ideas on how to just make life bareable right now?"
2523,Anxiety,“I had a good childhood”,"My parents like to say I had such a good childhood, like they didn’t bring me into this world addicted to heroin, my child hood was great they say because they always took me and a friend out to do cool stuff like my dad wasn’t screaming at my mom the whole time home or when he would start hitting her while she’s driving, and me and my friend would put a blanket over us, or how on the way home EVERY FUCKING TIME they’d stop at their dealers house and come back take us to the park &amp; we’re so oblivious right, young kids... so sitting on the swing waiting for my dad to come push me but his too busy sitting the car shooting up with my mom, but yeah we totally didn’t know what was going on. EVERY SINGLE DAY. “We always let u have friends over” right coz it’s so great having friends over in year 7 while my dads abusing my mom and she’s racing to the room with a bottle of water and a spoon... and I would just be sitting on the couch with my friend and look down the dreading hallway and just wishing I could escape this feeling. Like the times Me and my sisters would come home from school and the dining room sliding door would be closed &amp; we could always see them shooting up with there junkie friends thru the kitchen but there just drinking tap water with spoons right?? 
All I want is for them to acknowledge this and take responsibility for this, instead they are in complete denial and every time I try to explain how my childhood has effected me so much they will not listen because they choose to believe that all they did was good and I’m just exaggerating"
2524,Anxiety,"My anxiety/panic almost killed me, but there is hope. [POEMS]","A while ago now, I found myself at a crisis center. Plagued by panic, anxiety, depression, and associated alcohol abuse. Alcohol was the ONLY thing I had found that would stop an panic attack, and when I say panic attack I mean vicious hour + long attacks where I would go catatonic , and was so scared I couldn't move or speak. Anyways, in that crisis center I was Introduced to art. I am a former infantry Marine (2006-2010), and avid outdoorsman, and generally not someone who you would expect to see with a paintbrush and canvas. But friends, let me tell you.... forget any stigma you may have against being an artist. It is a way to cope that FAR exceeds any use of substance, and it is an outlet for things you never had a way /didn't know you needed to express. You don't have to be any good, and you don't have to do anything complicated, just give it a try. Draw something, color something, write a poem, paint. I promise you, it has the potential to change your life in an almost immeasurable and immediate way. I hope you all know you are not alone, and there are plenty of people out here who have been where you are. There is a lot of love, peace, happiness and beauty in this world. You can and you will have that someday if you don't right now. You may not ever be CURED but there are ways to cope and manage and enjoy life again. Much love to you all. Here are a few poems ...  Maybe not the best ever written. But remember, it just has to mean something to you.

2525,Anxiety,Hi! Be my friend!,"I just made a discord and want it to be a safe space for people to talk if they’re ever feeling bogged down by life.

2526,Anxiety,"First job, I’m terrified","Tomorrow I’m starting my first job and I want to cry so bad I feel like I’m gonna vomit I’m so nervous. I know I won’t be the only new hire so maybe there will be another clueless person or two who don’t know what to do, but I don’t even know where to go. I know that everything is something I have to learn and I think I’m okay with not knowing what’s going on kinda EXCEPT for literally not knowing where to go when I walk in :(
Maybe someone else has experienced something similar? If you have what did you do? (If it helps you give me an idea it’s just an average department store)"
2527,Anxiety,I get anxious at receiving a reply/text message and I can't do anything else,"When I ask/reply someone a message, in waiting time, I get very anxious, I think of many questions: do they response, how do they think/response, did I say something wrong, it takes so long so they must have hated me or I did something wrong,...like I think a lot. I just keep starring at a message client and sometimes I dont want to eat despite meal time or hungry like to the point I think blood sugar level has been dropped low. 

Like recently because of Covid I'm allowed to work from home. I thought it would be good for me because I don't have interact directly with people. but still everything have to communicate by a chat system of my company. then I still have to report, have to reply when being asked and ask when I need to.. (I report something that I've done, I ask for something to do when there's nothing to do, I reply when they ask why I did that, .....) many situations that could let me anxious, I would think my message has something wrong (although in many cases there are nothing wrong) and that I will being judged....

Anyone have the same feeling?

I think having anxiety and depression make me dont have any ambition into my job and drained my energy that make me feel being lazy and think I'm not doing a good job. 

for social relationship message is the same, if I send a message or something and takes so long for my friends to reply it would make me worry if I did anything wrong."
2528,Anxiety,Ativan SUCKS. Why is it even given to people?,"I had a severe attack early Sunday morning. Full on to PTSD levels, worrying I can't control the irrational part that self harms in response, and for once I went to the hospital instead of going it. That's progress, yay. 

Then they wanted to give me ativan. I asked if it was safe and they assured me it was. Well, it was awful. I did not feel less anxiety. Instead I felt like I was way deep underwater and couldn't do anything about it. It was like everything about me got shut down and I was trapped in a mini hell. 

Never again"

2531,Anxiety,Life wont ever be the same.,"So about an hour ago i had the worst anxiety attack. I’ve never been the type to be mentally broken as people would say. As i grew up i’ve always been true to myself and my morals but this year and last year has tested me to my limits. Growing up i always had my older brother to look up to and to teach me how to carry myself and provide for myself since my father and mother is old but recently about a year ago he’s been out of my life due to him studying and its been tough. I tend to always be the backbone for everyone and hold myself but now its my breaking point and i am genuinely confused to the point where i am confused about life. I just miss being young and innocent and enjoying the little things like going on a run with my brother or cooking with him and having late night talks. Im far from being lonely but it seems theres something missing from my life. I understand growing up can be tough but i thought it would be a phase since im only 16, its lasted longer than “just a phase”. Can anyone give me some wisdom and insight on what i can do to have hope for a better future. I have to start depending on myself more and its killing me everyday knowing that nothing will ever be the same. I just want life to go back to the simpler times."
2532,Anxiety,My left arm/shoulder/chest always hurts after exercise,Anyone else get this it’s super scary because it just screams heart attack but if it was I would have had a heart attack every day for the last 5 months. Sometimes it just hurts really bad without exercise especially in the morning r late at night. Has anyone experienced this/found a coping mechanism
2533,Anxiety,fucking pain,"before i start i think i should say i'm not medically diagnosed with anxiety. every time i tell my parents that it's not right and my anxiety attacks are happening they basically just tell me ""don't be anxious"". no help. what do i do?

secondly, how do you stop anxiety? i straight up get anxious over so many things and it's so bad to the point where i get anxiety induced diarrhea very often whenever i do literally anything besides sit at home. where my anxiety spirals out of control is where first i get anxious over the possibility of me getting anxious, then after that i get anxious over the forthcoming sharp ass stomach pain, and then the pain comes in. it literally cripples my social life to a ridiculous fucking mess where i can't do shit. 

is this normal or is this like really bad?"

I’ve been struggling a lot the past couple of weeks, with random crying spells, headaches and panic attacks throughout the day. I’ve also been oversleeping so much my energy was almost non existent for a few days... I would really appreciate if any of you would be up for a chat just to distract my mind a bit from all this"
2535,Anxiety,Fear of losing all thats important to me.,"Over the years I have developed a fear of losing people. I am constantly anxious about my actions and being good enough to be wanted and kept around. I have 2 amazing friends, we all support each other, and have all had rough years. As much as they reassure me that I wont lose them, it still panics me to think of life without them. My biggest fear at this moment in time is that my current episode is going to push them away. I dont know how to calm myself or stop overthiking silly things they say or do. I just want to be happy with what I have and stop worrying about what I might lose or what life will be like in the future. I do not want to be a burden to them but feel I already am."

I've always had anxiety around school and i have been skipping classes for the last 5 years but i haven't told anybody about it ( didn't even have the courage to tell my psychologist, how fucking dumb am i), plus i have had some other health issues last year which makes my brain even less performant. I'm so scared of failing that i feel like throwing up and i don't even know if i can tell my parents about my anxiety with school because they always tell me that i'm a brilliant student and i don't want to betray those expectation. To be honest right now i can only think about skipping the exams even if i know that it will make things worse. What should i do ? Who should i talk to ? How can i get myself to work ? Plz help"
2538,Anxiety,I lie to my therapist. A lot.,"I have a zoom therapy session this afternoon and I'm spending my morning carefully crafting how I'm going to tell my therapist how well I'm doing with my anxiety, my weight loss and my depression. 

None of it is true. But yes given me lots of exercises and life changes to try and improve and the truth is I've done a minimal amount of them but I'm too shamed to tell him that. So I fake it and act like things are much better than they are in reality. 

I do this even though I know it's stupid and means I'm paying 50 bucks to lie to someone I'm paying to help me. This is...insane."
2539,Anxiety,I need to make my friend agree to therapy. He's wasting away. Help please.,"He is wasting away, I can see it. Anxiety, depression, bulimia and more and more. I can't watch it and I can't do nothing. It is killing me, watching him like this. He has a nihilistic point of view as well and thinks it's all pointless anyway and I don't know how to convince him that therapy will help him. That there is hope. He has tried numerous times to finish university but he stops going every time after a semester or two. He says ""yes, but what do i study for? Work for what? What's the point? I'm fine this way."" he is stubborn. Idk what to do. I'd even pay for his therapy. If he agrees. If he just goes. How do I make him get better? How do I make him agree? I need him to fight this off."

I definitely have some sort of anxiety, as I have a lot of trouble sleeping (heart rate is definitely high then) but during waking hours I feel like my heart is beating really fast but when I check my heart rate monitor, I'm in the normal 70-80 BPM area.

2545,Anxiety,I need some urgent support and advice for my problem ASAP:Me (17M) and my classmate (17F)(long story),"(Be advised , I'm going to use fake names for security/privacy purposes)

(Sorry if I my English is bad ( third language ) )

I'm Jack , 17 y.o student in High school (I'm Tunisian so we have a different school system . There are 4 grades in high school and I'm 3rd grade , and the 4th is the baccalaureate and then University)

So some info about me , I'm an introverted male , never been in a relationship , not much friends , socially akward , paranoied and got many anxiety disorders ( **Self**\-**diagnosis** ) , low self-esteem , and I'm pretty smart and good-looking ( as I was told xD )So everything started when I entered the high school 2 years ago :

**First Grade :** So I'm among the first students in the school ( or was xD ) and I have my reputation ( I wear classy clothes and I'm known as FBI because I can get any info I want on any person ..) So things were good until I noticed a girl in the other class , let's call her Diana , so Diana was from the Pioneer Secondary School ( before the high school , some kind of elite school for elite students ) and I liked her , ( I know her because my cousin was her classmate ) And I started to have some strange feelings. So I started taking some photos and following her and then I wrote a journal and I collected some pics of her house and set them in the journal , everything was fine until the journal got leaked ( no need to dive into details ) and I didn't know that at the time , and I got undirectly rejected and I got really sad , like really really sad , probably depressed , abandoned my studies and my own health for 4 months and I my average fell from 17/20 to 14/20 and there is very very large and big gap between 17/20 and 14/20 , I didn't care at all . Couple of friends were there for me and helped me to get back on my feet and I managed to increase my average to 15/20 and I moved on . That Summer I tried see what went wrong ( I'm a rational guy and I like analyzing things and I like psychology ) and I started discovering things about emotions and love and all that stuff and I swore an oath to not fall into that ""trap"" again in the next grade.

(smth forgot to mention , I'm on #nofap journey and , this detail can probably clear things for you )

**Second Grade :** Second Grade , Science Section , first couple of weeks went good , some familiar faces , some friends from the previous grade , and some other people I know , and an Old friend , let's call her Wendy , I knew her for 5 years . So I started catching up with Wendy and we started to talk more , everything normal . Until one day , our professor was absent so we had an empty hour, I stayed with her and some other classmates in our class and then she started talking to her friend , let's call her Angel ( this is the 17F ) and I stayed in the corner reading a book , then Wendy invited me to chat with them ( there was another girl with them , a friend of Angel, let's call her Isabell ) So we started chatting , I didn't talk so much , because Angel and Isabell were strangers ) .

The next day , it was a 2h technical studies session , I was in group of 5 and Angel was one of them , we finished our exercises in 1hr and somehow we started talking and discussing about many topics , we started with politics and then dived to more deeper things like philosophy and physics and chemistry . I felt like I found someone who can understand those topics and I can discuss it with , it felt amazing , something I never felt before , a mix of joy and relief. Once we got home , we chatted for 5hr straight ( 7PM to 00 AM ) We talked about psychology and many other things , she mentioned smth : "" I did know you nd I was pretty sure w'll be good friends "" and "" Wendy told me about how mindful you are last year and I automatically knew that you were one of those rare people "" You can't imagine how happy I was when she told me that . I felt something more exciting , I found someone who finally UNDERSTANDS ME. I was very happy , like I'm on top of the world. We became close friends within a week. She said she quickly trusted me which is ""rare"" . We talked about "" love "" and then she told me this "" I'm an atheist when it come to love "" ( Is it true ? can someone be like that ?)So we kept talking and chatting like that for a month , and we started to sit close to each other in class. And I remember a saturday night , I was bored so within 30 min I tracked her house and then I felt some guilt and I said to myself "" If I don't stop this , I will repeat the same mistake as Diana "" So I stopped

And things went good until one day.

One day , my cousin came to me and told me that Isabell knows that I was interested and probably had a crush on Angel , and she is willing to tell her, thank god my cousin convinced her to not do that. At night , I chatted with Isabell about that subject and about Angel and how I just want to keep a friendly relationship until I sentenced myself to die , I accidentally told her that I know where Angel lives, and Isabell was like 😮 . She was shocked , and she told me she will try to keep this ""shit"" secret because it was 'scary"" as she said . Long story short , my ""secret"" didn't make 4 days , I fought with Isabell and she decided to tell Angel , so I went to tell her first , at least she will hear that shit from me , but it was toooooooooooo late. That day was fucked up , I didn't fell good at all , didn't look good , my face was pretty yellow , I had headaches , didn't focus on a very important chemistry lesson , so I didn't understand it at all. I went back home , I closed my room and started writing , until I wrote a very long letter , it took me 3hr. I sent it , she read it and she said she needs time , I said ok. I went to check Isabell and tried to open up a conversation so we can discuss what happened , I told her to send me the last science lesson we learnt ( I just wanted to open up a damn conversation ) and she said "" screw you "" Out of anger I wrote another letter , this time for Isabell and it wasn't good one , sent it . After couple of days she read it and she got mad how I said such a thing about her , again long story short , she told Angel , and after another chat with Angel she said she will forgive me when Isabell do. A detail to mention , that whole shit happened a couple of days before the semster's exams , so at least you know how stressed I was.

After 3 months , we started slowly chatting back , me and Angel , but it was never the same as before , and then the COVID-19. We chatted a bit in the first months of the COVID and then ( Juin ) I sent her a message and she didn't replay , no "" seen "" so my paranoia and overthinking assumed that she was ignoring me . Didn't talk to her.

**Third Grade :** sept. 15 : we came back to school and she was my classmate , didn't talk to her for the first couple of days then I had to tell her that I have an amount of money to give her ( last year she gave me some money for some donation purposes and the donation was canceled)

I gave her her money back , and after 1 hour I was talking to a friend and she joined the discussion, step by step we started talking about some things like the pandemic, system ... And then we talked about smth ( no need to mention it , a casual thing ) and I wanted her to convince me to do that thing ( again , a casual thing , not smth important ) she said ok , that night we talked a little bit about that subject and she said that she will continue the conversation tomorrow.

The next day , I was looking for her and I found her talking with a classmate so I didn't approach her and thought she will probably be bothered if I asked her.

When we were walking out of school I asked her and she said : ""Why didn't you come earlier ?""

I said that I saw her with a couple of mates talking and she said : ""That won't bother me , we are friends for 2 years , like you are not a new mate ""

When I heard that I became happy , because I knew right then and there that she wasn't angry at me.

We chatted about that subject at night and then we opened one of those deep psychology subjects, and I felt that she became too open for a while , she told me that "" she got her heart broken"" and then she deleted the message because she "" don't like word broken "" .

The next night , we started talking as usual , but things went south this time , I was asking questions ( usual ) and I asked her "" why are you answering my questions ? "" she didn't respond. And then suddenly she started asking some strange questions ( Do you think evrthg I said is framed ? Do you think I'm framed ? Do you think I trust you ? Do you trust me ? Is this a safe place ? Do I care about trusting you ? .....)

Then she answered my question : ""I was just talking to a '' friend'' "" and said : "" Remember what you told me last year about evrthg you and your struggles with being an introvert and then one of your biggest regrets what you did to Diana Then you did the same thing with me and I got pretty angry but I ended up forgetting about it because I started considering you as a friend that's why I answered your questions Because I still considered you as a friend but it's clear we don't have the same intentions ""

I was pretty shocked and said : So do I , believe or not those emotions were not real and not compatible with me , why ? because for the last 2 years I was unconsciously forcing them, explains why they don't exist when I rationalize them. So do I , I consider you as a friend .

I didn't sleep that night , and I got mad and sad , like really sad , I felt smth painful, I was stressed and started going down.

(that was 10 days ago )

(this was 7 days ago ) A couple of friends came to me and talked to me and told me to move on and forget her , they even tried to force me to unfriend her from Facebook, I can't, every day I read those old beautiful conversations about the topics I love. And I regret every single mistake I made. I see her connected and I feel sad because I can't talk to her , or I'm forcing myself not to. I feel guilty because she trusted me within a week, she was expecting me to be a new good friend but I betrayed all of that.

She also told me that she is "" Insidious "" ( this is her own term ) If anyone can explain this term.

After collecting some Intel I found that:

When she told me I'm rare , she said I'm the second rare guy she meets , there was a guy before me , and he ""badly screwed it up"" as she said , so she didn't talk to him anymore , something needs to be mentioned , she said that she passed every single summer night chatting with him , with another detail ""we were just friends"". Another thing , in the Second Grade , we were talking in the school about depression and inner problems and issues and she said she was fighting that crap for 2 years , another thing , as I said above , she recently told me that she got her ""heart broken"" and got ""betrayed from a close one"" , and chose to not tell me who or what the story as she said : "" you've known enough about me already hopefully you'll understand "" and "" Some things are just better left unsaid that's all "". She also said that "" I just don't rlly open up so I usually I'm the only person to calm myself down and get my shit together u know sometimes it's just tiring a little bit but I'm not gonna stay like this forever though "" . A very important detail which is : ""No one rlly gets me I'm kinda complicated I'm a bit holistic and love to think big so I never rlly met anyone who actually knew me, maybe if am being permissive only one person "" . There are many details, I tried to set the most important ones .

She is, according to my Theory , Injured and wounded , that first rare guy probably broke her heart and that changed her , probably made her toxic(emotionally) , so she started hating feelings because she don't want to be vulnerable...(Some details are 3 to 4 years old, I started linking the pieces trying to find why she is like that )

Anyway , if you reached here then I really thank you for reading all of my crap and drama-shit, and I want to hear your advice, your suggestions, everything will help I just want to fix this if it is possible , can I win her back , can I get her out of her darkness , is she really injured and can my theory be true ?( professional help like a Psy. is acquired )

TD:LR : I have some issues with a very complicated girl , who doesn't show emotions and doesn't like love. I'm trying to figure out why she is like that, help me if you can, thank you :)"
2546,Anxiety,"Anxiety from new job is making me lose sleep, more emotional and I can barely eat.","I've been in this line of work for 4 years now. I recently accepted a new job, exactly the same role at another company with a significant raise in my salary. But the way they operate is much much different in regards to their policies and its so strict and extremely detail oriented.. I'm having difficulty adjusting. I used to pay too much attention to detail and management had made me stop and now I have to get back into being as detailed oriented as possible.

I'm just really freaking anxious cause based on my colleague reviewing my work...i know for a fact I'm going to fail audits and we get audited on every file we work on. I know I'm new, I know it takes an average of 3 months for people to settle into a new job. But the anxiety is making me lose sleep. I think I got 2 hours last night. I can barely deal with any other stresses outside of work that I end up crying. I'm in my damn 30s and I'm crying cause I can't handle anymore stress/anxiety. I can't even eat.
I wanted this job for more money... Now I don't know if it's even worth it anymore. All the concerns in my mind are moving 2000000km/hr. I want to quit. I want to quit... But I know I shouldn't be running from my problems. I just want a big long hug and curl up into a ball in bed under all my blankets and hibernate and not worry about work."
2547,Anxiety,How to make safe environment for friend with anxiety issues?,"I have a friend who is suffering from anxiety and has panic attacks really often when we hang out with our group, apparently the attacks are so bad that he avoids hanging out with friends in fear of a panic attack. He is not talking about it so could some of you give me some insight how it feels and how to behave so it would be easier for him to be with friends? I just want to help him so he can escape the ""moms basement"" and live a normal life."
2548,Anxiety,Going to the eye doctor today wish me luck!,Since about a month ago I started having some eye irritation so I thought it was my contacts and went to the eye doctor to find out my left eye has some pressure on it. My doctor thought it could be because I used steroid eye drops and that can raise the pressure. Now a month later I’m still feeling the pressure and some redness. I’m so terrified if this is more than just anxiety! I never had any eye problems except for having to wear contacts and glasses and I have a high prescription but that is it. I’m only 27 and I can’t even process going blind at such a young age or if at all ever in my life. I feel like my life would be over if I were. I’m so scared of what this could be. But part of me is like well some of it could be anxiety related maybe? I’m like 50/50 scared and partially excited because if it is just anxiety then I know I’m going to feel a huge sigh of relief today and my anxiety will be lifted but if not then that’s a whole different story!
2549,Anxiety,How do I genuinely treat anxiety/stress,"I know it’s a broad question, 

But I’ve come to the realisation that I’m really struggling. 

I lost my farther a few months ago at the age of 18. 

I feel sick constantly, I struggle to eat because I just feel like throwing up. I really struggle with going out socially because I again feel sick, and I obvisoly don’t want to be sick in public ie the cinema. A few other things like heavy sweating, tingling in hands made me think I have anxiety. 

I’ve never actually thrown up due to this. But I’m hungry most of the time due to it. 

The only answer I can find is therapy. I don’t want therapy. I really don’t see how talking about it will help when I can just write it here or tell someone else to no avail. 

What’s my next step? Thanks"
2550,Anxiety,Do Monday’s activate anyone else’s fight or flight response like they do to me?,"Monday’s are the worst day of the week for me by far. I know no one likes Monday especially if they have to work like I do. However I am afraid of them. I actually start to hyperventilate.

If it weren’t for meditation I wouldn’t make to work. I have called out so often in the past that I have been fired due to too many absences. All so I could lay under a blanket(head and all) and pretend everything was ok and I was “safe from the world in there.

I’m freaking out now.. leave for work in an hour..."
2551,Anxiety,I took a taxi for the first time!,"This was a couple days ago. I'm 23 years old and have never taken a taxi on my own terms. Always with someone else, even then it would be rare. Which is embarrassing because my family owned a taxi firm my entire childhood... 
But I finally did it! I was super shaky when I got home, but I survived! 
The reason for my breakthrough though is kinda sad. I usually would walk home from the train station which is almost an hour to walk with several uphills. But this time it was broad daylight and I was too embarrassed to drag my bags and suitcase with me. Because i thought people would stare and judge me. Maybe even someone I knew would drive past and question me... So I took a taxi impulsively to avoid possibly being judged. Funny that ahaha...."
2552,Anxiety,Heightened reaction and getting stressed about everything,"Every since I was kid Ive always struggled with anxiety and stress. In the past I was able to manage it. But as I get older, it’s becoming harder to stop stressing even over the smallest and trivial things. Whenever I get overly excited I get stressed, whenever I’m sad I get stressed, whenever I’m bored I get stressed, whenever I’m busy I’m stressed. I guess I call it a heightened reaction because every time I react to something I get stressed. Is there anything I can do to fix this? Deep down I know I shouldn’t be stressing, but my brain just won’t shut off"
2553,Anxiety,I've been getting nightmares lately..,"Getting some terrible nightmares lately about my education. I know it's probably cause of my worries and anxiety towards the particular event. I said that I'll accept the fact if I get failed in re-exam.. but I'm genuinely tired of being stuck in highschool. I'm really having fun in online classes of university, my curiosity and creativity is also peaked. But If I fail the re-exam, my admission will be cancelled and I'll have to wait for yet another year to join university. 

I'm already 2 years late...[ I took a drop once cause of health issues after sophomore, and I failed myself last year from extreme pressure]. I don't think I'll be able to study the last year of highschool for the third time.. I feel like I'm dumb, but I know I'm not. The thing that stops me from passing is my anxiety which screws me over the exam. 

Anyhow, My result will be out within 5 days, but Can I really wait? Idk. I'm not sure if I'm prepared myself to face reality either whether I pass or terribly fail."
2554,Anxiety,Do I just got this assignment to do for English class and this is my worst nightmare,"We are reading Beowulf and we have to write a boasting poem and film ourselves doing it.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to calmly do this and not sound too nervous or how to write a poem???"
2555,Anxiety,Illogical thoughts,"I'm (19M) a student who has always lived categorized as the ""smart kid"" as I skipped 2 grades in primary school. I hate being treated as such as I find myself really dumb particularly socially speaking. I feel like I've lived my whole life socially late, like everything that seems socially normal for my friends, I understand it several years after.

I've developed this summer an anxiety disorder (regular hypertension and panic attacks since then) but I feel like these are only amplified symptoms of my normal state : I'm constantly anxious especially socially, apart from that it feels like normal life ""pressure"".

The thing is, I only have a few friends, and as I have always been, I really doubt being a *real* friend for them (they don't act between them as they do with me) even though we *seem* pretty close. And I've finally found the strength to share what has been happening to me this summer, which prevented me to meet them after 3 months of lockdown and work. But it seems like they did not really care, were only polite to say ""that's sad, keep strength"" and stuff, but I don't think they realize the impact it has on me. 

That makes me doubt more and more our friendship and that's the reason of this post. I believe I can call this social anxiety, but how to deal with this impression to not know what is socially normal ?

Sorry for potentially weird phrasing, not a native speaker, and thanks for your answers"
2556,Anxiety,Purchase anxiety?,"I generally don't have anxiety or irrational fears. But my family grew up insane about saving money (though we had it until the recession and my parents divorced and it was just a mess.)

Anyway, I'm 24 years old, broke my laptop, and am feeling ridiculous because I can't order a new one. I have the money, I just physically/psychologically? I don't know, but I can't order it.

I've already bought and returned two over two months, canceled even more orders. My heartbeat goes crazy when I type in my card #, I start shaking, and when I get it, I want it out of my house immediately because I don't think ""I deserve it."" I'm afraid I'll get the 'wrong' one, as a child if I made a wrong decision concerning money, or asked for a toy that happened to break later, that was wholly and 100% on me. I feel like that now, I feel so stupid because I'm a grown ass woman and it's my money. But also terrified because I'm a grown ass woman and it's my money.

I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I've always had problems spending money as I got older. I've never bought anything like this all at once. It's so stupid. Advice please so I can just order the damn thing?"
2557,Anxiety,Anxiety about workplace and making mistakes,"Hi all,

I have major anxiety related to my workplace. I teach at a university and I feel like I'm under so much pressure all the time.   
I have GAD and OCD. I am very hard on myself and get really anxious if I make any kind of mistake or things don't go to plan. I know I'm good at my job but I still get very tripped up with anxiety. I catastrophize and I also think ahead to potential things that could go wrong. I'm scared of looking bad in front of the students and doing something that would cost me my job. Right now I'm having a bout of insomnia related to job stress. Not sure if anyone can relate."
2558,Anxiety,I hate when having a bad mental health day makes me seem like a flake,"Calling in sick to work or having to cancel on some obligations or plans to meet someone because I just can't face the day - it makes me feel pathetic. 

I tend to just say I'm feeling unwell rather than that it's anxiety too, not because I necessarily think that they won't understand but that the idea of disclosing my anxiety issues to people who don't know I have them gives me even more anxiety. 

It makes me feel extremely guilty when I look at other people doing worse jobs with bigger workloads who don't seem to struggle to just get on with it. I have an extremely forgiving schedule and do work I enjoy but still have these days where I'm a useless lump who can't do anything. How do I look at my co-worker who is a single mum with two kids and say I haven't done my share of a project yet because my stupid feelings are too much to bear?"
2559,Anxiety,"Maybe obvious, but I finally see the direct connection between my painful childhood and my adult anxiety. Now what to do about it?","I have had severe anxiety for my entire adulthood.  Meds don’t touch it.  Regular cognitive behavioural therapy has never been able to ‘punch through’ to the source of the pain, always only dealing with the symptoms in some horrible whack-a-mole type game.  

I have always struggled with the feeling that I was a ‘bad kid’ when young, a ‘bad person’ as an adult.  In my core, I have always thought I was just bad.

I have for years avoided my family and allowed a very limited relationship with them, without ever really knowing why.  They are not bad people, in fact, my entire family has always been loving and supportive to me.  


Yesterday, I spoke on the phone to my mom.  Despite me desperately not wanting to talk about the past at all, she shared one or two stories about how I was growing up....  they were really not terrible and my mom tried to do it with gentleness.  But I ended up crying so hard that we had to cut the phone conversation short.  I had horrible anxiety all night and have been weepy all morning.  The pain of a lifetime of being a ‘bad kid’ in my own mind is all just right at the surface.

It might seem obvious to everyone, but I never connected the fact that my anxiety is my mind’s attempt to avoid the thoughts and feelings that I am a bad kid.   But I finally see it today.

So my question: what do I do about it?  How do i heal this awful wound?  How do I let go of the deeply entrenched idea that I am a bad person?  Objectively, I know I am not.  But the pain is so real, so intense that I have spend my entire life trying to get away from it.  

Is there anyone/anything that can act as a guide for me as I walk down this horrible path?  I want to see it all the way through, so that I can finally put this monstrous lie to bed."

2563,Anxiety,Exercising makes my anxiety worse,"I hate to admit this and quite frankly, I’m really embarrassed about it. For some reason when I exercise my anxiety gets worse.

When I worry about these worst case scenarios, my therapist asks me “is it necessary?” - is it necessary to think of situations that aren’t happening. My answer was always no because it’s true. It’s not necessary. 

There are some situations where prepping for the worst case scenario is helpful. I just need to be mindful when it is necessary or not."

2570,Anxiety,Do you feel extremely anxious for no reason?,"I feel terribly anxious the past couple weeks - shaking, nausea, tummy aches, palpitations and sometimes heartbroken but there's no logical reason for me to feel like this. Initially I thought it was because I was returning to work after I was signed off for two months due to fractured ribs but my colleagues were so welcoming and I was happy to be back, yet the anxiety seems to be getting worse. I've lost a bit of weight in a short amount of time too because I got bored of eating or I'm too anxious to chew and swallow my food. I just want to feel okay again. 

A friend recommended me to try 5HTP so I'm going to give that a go. In the meantime, I now have a weighted blanket so at least it would make me feel like I'm being hugged, haha.

I may be biased, but I have some excellent students, two of whom objected to the testing out of privacy concerns, as the college wanted their medical insurance information. The students have tried to work with administration on a compromise to no avail. In order to return to class they must be tested, but now no one will return their correspondence to set up a testing appointment. Part of me wants to do something, but I am so afraid to do so, and would honestly just rather break down and cry. Although I understand the mentality behind the test, the forcing of it and requirement of the insurance information seems excessive. Part of me wants to rise up like a bear, and another part of me wants to ball up in a corner. Anxiety sucks."

Before 2020, I used to be quite an amicable and sociable person. I've always felt anxious before meeting someone new or having to hang out with someone I'm not very close to, one-on-one, but it was something that I could handle. However, during this pandemic, we all quarantined for months and now that things are easing up in my country and we are allowed to travel and meet our friends a bit more freely, I feel very very anxious. I feel like I've forgotten how to socialise with people, I'm not quite sure what to talk about. My mind is just always blank and feel nauseous hours before I have to meet someone. I just started an internship recently and I've been absolutely DREADFUL at making conversation with my colleagues. Usually, I'd be awkward for the first one week but I'd be able to ease into a new setting and converse with people. But this time round, I've been in the company for around a month and I can't seem to converse with anyone. And don't get me wrong, the people who I'm working with are absolutely lovely, they initiate conversations also. But I seem to have forgotten how to converse in full sentences, how to continue a healthy conversation. And it really SUCKS. THIS FEELING. And the painfully awkward moments that everyone around me has to endure. What can I do to cope with this better? Anyone has any tips? Or maybe does anyone else feel this way?"

Well, today I ate the same bag of potatoes again (a lot more). It's been 1-2 hours and I have not had the reaction! I know it's small, but I'm relieved! I feel one step closer to conquering my anxiety now I know how real the physical symptoms are!"

Today was the first day we had to go in lectures since the break up and as soon as i woke up i was shaking. 

The nearer i was getting to the university the worst it was becoming. 
When i entered the building and started going up the stairs i felt dizzy, lightheaded, nauseous and my muscles started hurting. 
When i was already on the 4th floor where my first lecture was, i had shortness of breath, my mouth was super dry, and almost fainted + the symptoms from before (i am atletic and healthy) . It was severe for around 15minutes and then it calmed down. But i felt the symptoms, untill we finished lectures. 

When i went home i cried for a little and then went to the toiled and had diarrhea(i haven't eaten anything since she broke up with me, thats 4 days now).

 At the moment of writing this i still shake a little and dont feel good at all. I am not hungry either (which is weird for me as i am 87kg and 190cm tall and get hungry as soon as i wake up or after lectures usually)

I need advices please"
2584,Anxiety,How to cope when you can't escape a trigger?,"content warning if you have any sort of aversion to bugs. 

\---

Hi everyone - I'm a long-time anxiety sufferer, but have been managing pretty well with a combination of meds and therapy. That is, until something happens that manages to knock me too far off balance. 

Long story short, I have a bit of an ant problem. I got back from a visit to a friend, and bam, ants in my apartment.  Obviously a bit of a stressor for anyone, but even after putting down my own bait traps (somewhat effective, but still had ants) and calling a pest control company (they put down more bait, jury's still out on how effective it is), I still find a few of them crawling around my kitchen floor every day. 

I think this wouldn't be an issue if they weren't in the kitchen, but I'm reaching the point where I can't seem to function normally anymore. I wake up super tense and anxious. I go to bed tense and anxious. I haven't been eating well because I'm afraid to cook or eat food in the vicinity of the ants. My body is pretty angry at me. I have at least one breakdown to a friend or family member a day. Sometimes I can't do anything but cry.

I feel ridiculous. The ants are small. I *know* they can't hurt me. I *know* this may be something I have to live with for a bit while the professionals figure out where they're coming from and how to get to the source of the problem. But try telling that to the anxiety elephant sitting on my chest. 

I've experienced a similar pattern of events before with different issues. Something happens that's out of my control and that I can't escape from. I get into a pattern of really bad anxiety in the morning and at night, with some reprieve during the day while I'm at work or talking to people I trust. I start to avoid activities that bring me into contact with the trigger that I can't control. Weekends are generally terrible. 

If anyone else has had similar experiences and/or found a coping mechanism that helps manage the intense waves of anxiety, I'd appreciate hearing from you. Mostly, I just wanted to get this off my chest. I feel really alone (it doesn't help that I live alone) and I'm scared. Thanks."
2585,Anxiety,Anyone else very scared of loud noises?,"I'm not sure if this is caused by anxiety but simple things like the door being slammed shut make me shake and hearing muffled loud talking/arguing makes me tear up because I most of the time think its because of me. 
Also whenever the teacher in school slams the desk to get the students attention I always jump/flinch and my heart starts beating even if it's not that bad ughh. I noticed other people not reacting that way so it obviously makes me super anxious that someone saw me ://"
2586,Anxiety,How do I know If I have anxiety?,"The title says it all. I overthink all the time, get stressed easily, and worry about the simplest of things. I know it isn't smart to ask the internet for help, but I just don't know what to do."

I'm really not sure where else I could ask this because I'm not the direct type with my feelings. I'm struggling with the thought of even telling my family and I honestly suck at talking to my psychiatrist because she makes it clear she's too busy for me. I'm paranoid to ask my other psychiatrist because she's affiliated with my school. I just want an honest answer from someone who's impartial without it affecting my life in some way. Yeah, it's Reddit, but I'm the extreme ""over cautious"" LOL

It's a bit of a story, so I'm sorry if it's too much.

I've suffered with serious panic disorder/anxiety since I was young, my parents think it’s on the “genetic” side for me. I had Colic as a baby. I had acid reflux as a toddler. I grew up with stomach pains constantly, puking every morning, randomly passing out, and joint pain. I was that ""sick kid"" all through elementary and middle school. It wasn't until I got to junior high (8/9 grade in my district) that I started having panic attacks full blown. They were awful and constant. There were days I just blacked out in the hallway, days my teachers had to take me to the nurse. I was eventually diagnosed, truly, with generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and depression at 14. I got on medication, I was ""good"" for a while.

As far as my parents knew, I was doing completely fine once I started the meds. I had maintained a 4.00 GPA all through school and had taken multiple AP courses as well. I was a good student, as weird as it is to say. I was in every music/arts group, I was a drum major, and I was a captain of the golf team. I was able to funnel myself into every outlet I wanted to. I was this creative person who wrote and sold art in my spare time. My mother championed me once I was diagnosed, so proud of everything I could do while dealing with ""mental health 24/7"". She incorporated everything she learned in her studying on mental health into her teaching (she's an educator). It really made it a difference, I could hear it in the stories she told me about her interactions with students. She emphasized school so heavily growing up, monitoring our grades and emails. She was the only one in her family of first-gen Americans to go to a university. My dad hadn’t truly gone away either, just doing an online degree in his 40’s. It was odd, but for whatever reason, I internalized that *so much*. All I wanted to do was make my mother proud. I loved hearing how she helped people with how she felt about me. I loved hearing her brag to my family about me becoming a doctor. I loved my extended family telling me everyone was so proud of me “going away and doing great things”. I wanted to keep that feeling she (and everyone else) had about me no matter what it took.

Because of this and not wanting to taint her beautiful image of me, I did everything I could to suppress my feelings. The meds *had* worked, but they stopped after a while. I developed really disordered eating and SH habits. I was small, I was hurting myself in multiple different ways. I never said anything. I tried taking a ton of pills once, but it wasn't a conscious suicide-attempt. I think it was more dissociative than anything. I felt like my mom knew to some degree I was hurting myself, but I never had any event happen where I can say for sure. I eventually ""corrected"" myself as I say with the help of my friends, who had all been through their own mental health struggles in some way.

I suppressed it and ignored it until I went to college. I had gotten the full-ride I competed for, was in the major I wanted, and had lucked out in multiple different ways leading up to my first semester. All that lack of sleep, nights from crying from studying, joint pain from writing, and stress puking was worth it now… right? School was my focus. It always had been. It was my identity. College was supposed to be what I was made for… but from there, I crashed. I called my family every day, talking about these great things I was doing in band, and the whole time I was binging and spiraling. I managed to stay afloat by begging professors for second chances and using my disability accommodations I had gotten once I went off to school. By the end of my freshman semester of college, I had been on 3 different anxiety meds and was on 4 total. I was also 35 lbs heavier than my weight when I left HS.

This killed my confidence in my second year. I hated music at this point. My college's marching band was very clique-based. The sections' individual cultures were really intense and mine was none existent. People were mean. I talked to no one for 14 hrs every Saturday and it was much more obvious it was intentional. Now, something I had looked forward to all of HS was a bust and I wanted nothing to do with it. Second semester of sophomore year comes around and COVID has hit. I have to go home. I went from my one-bedroom on-campus apartment with my service dog (gotten summer between freshman and sophomore year) back home to my mom teaching from home, my sister (16F) learning from home, and me as well.

I'm 5 different meds in, on 4 still, and none of them are working. I'm in the worst possible place I could be. All while I was dealing with my anxiety/depression worsening with the pressure of college and hiding it to try to stay afloat, my sister had been dealing with hers in much more obvious, destructive ways. Her issues have been stemming from social issues, having changed schools the year before. She was skipping school, flunking, abusing pot, and verbal abusing my mother to the point of tears. I had heard about it in phone calls from my mom over the years while I was away, but now I was there. I was home with all of this happening, none of it really peaking while I was home from school (ie the primary trigger).

Over the course of my time away, my mom’s calls become this odd way of me feeling useful to my family even though I was gone. I was wanted. I would coach my mom through all this stuff she was dealing with, with my sister. I was good at reasoning through things and putting it well, for someone who was awful at dealing with their own feelings. My mom felt I was objective and it was helpful to her understanding. She kept calling, I kept answering, and my sister kept acting out. I finally got to see what my mom was talking about.

Something I didn’t expect (in hindsight, I was dumb) was for my sister’s rage and anxiety to be channeled towards me. She was aggressive and I felt I was dropped without choice into the middle of this. Every night was my sister, mother, and father shouting about school work, behavior in school, or how her car smells like pot even though they cleaned it out after she got caught by the cops again. Everyday I am getting yelled at by her, threatened, dragged into something, or listening to me being heard about. I was ammunition, a catalyst, and a target all at once. Mainly, it was my sister, but my mom would try dragging me in with the expectation I’d diffuse the situation but it never worked. All my mother’s talk of “not relying on me” hadn’t really worked. She felt like she wasn’t really and she wasn’t, but I don’t think she realized how deeply I felt the times that she did and what she did/said. 

End of sophomore year, my sister gets put into the hospital after my parents' concern peaks. She finally “detoxes” and has to confront what she’s using the weed to cope with. Don’t get me wrong, I smoke. Marijuana is great if you’re controlled with it. My sister was 16, *abusing it*, and using it to avoid actually dealing with her problems to the point it was causing her issues with cops, nearly flunking out, and getting aggressive when my parents would toss her stuff. She was using a dab rig before school in her car, hitting her pen in the bathroom, a joint while driving home, and smoking the day away in the bathroom by the window or in her car. 

My mom had a breakdown. Was she a bad parent? Was this the right thing? Is this what would finally help? At least she had one daughter that was on the “good path”, right? I comforted my mom. Talked to her about what I had hear of in-patient treatment from my friends, what I had seen during my visits to friends, and telling her what my sister needed to learn. My mom, in true fashion, threw herself into research and was trying her damned hardest to make this work. My mom always wanted things to work for us. She cared and tried. She really did. 

Sophomore to junior year, this past summer, I moved in with my boyfriend to try and take a step away from everything going on with my sister. My shot at “protecting my health” and getting out of a toxic environment for myself. We did great and I felt better than I had in awhile. The whole time I’m taking classes because I went on probation for my scholarship because of my grades. I change my career path (not major) from all the doubt. I was super nervous going into this year. I was going to be isolated in my apartment, all my 400+ level classes online, and no groups that are accepting this year. 

\[\[Now I’m here, in the fall semester of my junior year. School has been trash with teacher tech knowledge/use so I’ve had such a difficult time learning, a hard time with my accommodations being met, and the classes are just whooping my ass. I was organized, I felt better prepared but nothing could stick in my head well enough for exams. A’s on every assignment, every lab, every participation check, but my exams were pushing just too much for me to understand the content truly. I studied, I didn’t sleep, I drilled. I wanted so badly to do well… but I just *didn’t.*

I failed an exam for the first time. Not just “doing bad”, but to the point I might as well have skipped it and taken a zero. It sounds miniscule in the scheme of things, just one bad test, but it *broke* me. My grade wouldn’t recover, I would lose my scholarship, I was done. Everything I had worked for my entire life had snapped because of everything I could knit pick. My anxiety had skyrocketed and I was sobbing. I called my mom and finally unloaded on her for the first time. She had me come home for a while, wanting to see if being around family would help.

It has, to some degree. I’m trying to be positive right now, but I’m just burnt out. I don’t know where to go. My sister is applying to colleges now (17/18F) and there’s so much arguing in the house from that and hybrid schooling. My boyfriend purposely pushes my nerves to be funny and works full time, so now I get worked up even thinking over going over to just be wound up into a minor anxiety attack for a gag and be by myself from 8 pm - 6 pm. I’m doing better in school now that I really have a space to focus and that’s what I associated with my room at home, but deep down, nothing’s changed and I realized that last night.

I’m where I was in junior high, before I was even medicated. I cycle from an insomniac to fatigue/perpetual exhaustion, I’m numb, I’m puking every morning, I’m twitching all the time, and just a mess. My dad commented on my bags under my eyes for the first time. I’ve lost 15 lbs from not eating/puking. I’m just uninterested. It’s weird that I’m like that, especially because every other facet of my life is going well by normal standards.

Functionally, socially, school-wise I am starting to do better. I am going out with my friends (socially distant and all that), spending time with my family (we do have good moments), and have been doing better in school this past week than I have in a long time. I’m on meds, I’m with a better psychiatrist, my dog’s training is finishing up. I should be good. I wanted to enjoy my best friend’s 21st birthday with her family and friends partying, I wanted to enjoy my sister doing well on her SAT, I wanted to be happy that I passed my exam from Thursday. I don’t want my mom to be disappointed. I don’t want her to have two broken kids. I want to be better for her. I want to keep my scholarship. I want to have something to look forward to in life. 

I should be calm, satisfied, and happy with the direction of my life right now. I’m on an upward trend, it’s a positive. I see that. Why can I just not be happy with it? Instead, I am exhausted, apathetic to everyone/everything, and I’m just *done*. I just feel burnt out. I just want to hit a reset button on my body and not feel so tired, dull, and tense. Why do I just feel like I want to sleep and not wake up? I’ve powered through before. I should be able to handle this. I want to be able to handle this. I just really, really don’t want to. I don’t know how I could put my life on pause though to really do that. I can’t just “check out” for a week, a month, whatever. College doesn’t stop, my mom and sister’s lives don’t stop, life keeps going. I have to catch up or I’ll just slip off. Is this “burnt out”? Is that what this is? Or is this just me not keeping up? Is this me just hitting “the real world” and not being prepared enough? I’m only 20 and if this is how hard life is meant to be, I’m scared. 

I’ve spent the past hour writing this. I know the wording isn’t the best and the grammar probably isn’t strong, but I needed to get it off my chest somehow. I know I couldn’t authentically say it to anyone. That’d be too hard.\]\]

TL,DR: I’ve grown up with anxiety my entire life. My mother and I have made my entire identity around school. My sister has started dealing with social issues and severe anxiety/depression. My mother views me as a success story and I internalize that pressure. I’m struggling in school and my mental health has plummeted, but my mother is focused on my sister and I don’t want to break my mother’s expectations of me. Am I burnt out or am I just behind the “the real world”?"
2588,Anxiety,God. I hate this.,"Im so fucking socially awkward its PAINFUL. I may sound overly dramatic but I've just gone through a painfully awkward situation and. Oh my God. Why am I like this. Socializing has some pretty basic invisible rules that can help me avoid awkward shit from happening, but I still trip and fall into an awkwardness void. And i'm too fucking aware of how socially awkward i am to the point where others can notice it too. WHY AM I LIKE THIS why can't i talk normally like all the rest. Why do i have to take ages before i think of a half decent response. This also applies to TEXTING IM AWKWARD THROUGH FUCING TEXT TOO i hate this. People despise talking to me because I MAKE THE MOST NORMAL CONVERSATION AWKWARD WUXIDJEIXJ"
2589,Anxiety,I finished a whole grilled cheese!,"Lately my anxiety has been making it hard to eat full meals/meals at all. I’ve been barely choking down 4 bites of food at meal times and trying to supplement with nutrition drinks, all while feeling sick and nauseous almost all the time, and waking up starving in the mornings while still unable to eat much of anything. Even my favorite foods would sound good in concept, but be nauseating once set in front of me. Plus I was wasting so much food just trying to eat anything, and I hate things going to waste.

But today my dad made me a grilled cheese for dinner and I ATE THE WHOLE THING! I could feel that terrible stomach feeling trying to overcome me every time I let my thoughts wander, but when that happened I would slow down and take deep breaths and remind myself that everything is ok, then try to distract myself in the dinner table conversation.

Anyways, it’s not much, but it’s the first full meal I’ve been able to finish in weeks and I’m so happy I wanted to share."
2590,Anxiety,Debilitating anxiety for something I’ve never seen or read about,"Hi guys.
A long while ago after eating these sugar free chocolates I was unaware contained malitol (horrible laxative) and I had an accident with my girlfriend in the car caught in traffic. I ran out of the car before it happened and I was near a park, and I told her to go home and I cleaned myself up and called my parents. I’ve never had this happen before, and it turned my whole life upside down. After this, I begun to notice the moment I had an urge for peeing or pooping and my brain would instantly go into panic mode, meaning wherever I was, I had to find a toilet RIGHT NOW. Lockdown happened and inside my house all was well, until everything reopened and I was being invited to see friends again. I’ve never had any gastrointestinal issues before, and I used to be like clockwork, but it’s almost as if the moment I realise I have to poop, my body decides to force out whatever undigested food I have in my bowels, and I’m extremely uncomfortable and have had panic attacks if there’s no toilet close. This has made me spend the last few months inside my house. I’ve drifted apart from friends, I cant go anywhere I know there’s no bathroom immediately close, and simply sitting in the car makes my heart race. And the worst part is, at home, or in safe places, my BMs are totally normal, but the moment I start feeling anxious, I will always get diarrhoea. It’s a vicious cycle I can’t escape. I assumed it was IBS as the symptoms seemed in line with it and tried IBS treatments with no luck. I really do think my brain is just evacuating my bowels whenever I start stressing, and I don’t know how the hell to stop it."
2591,Anxiety,My throat, Feels tight or like it’s closing up...that is all
2592,Anxiety,Is this normal for people with anxiety,"Does anyone else get extremely anxious when ur interested in someone and they’re interested in you and they ask you to hang out alone. I’m 19 years old and before my ex and I started dating we were both extremely interested in eachother and hanging out in groups was so fun I always wanted to see him he made me crush so hard lol but the day he asked to hang out alone I felt EXTREME anxiety and would either avoid hanging out with him alone OR if I said yes the day if I would cancel and say “I didn’t feel good” (he knew it was from anxiety lol). I was just so scared of embarrassing myself, messing something up or being a bad kisser (I didn’t kiss anyone at the time only pecks) and I knew something would go down and that I would be a anxious WRECK. Does anyone else experience this? After my ex boyfriend and I got comfortable I enjoyed hanging out with ALL the time and was never nervous but I know it’ll be the same way with another guy. Is this common?"
2593,Anxiety,Hot flashes at night?,"Hi everyone this might be sorta weird but I gotta see if I'm alone in this. I'm 23F and have been getting hot flashes 2-4x per week at night around bedtime. I'm not near my period or in menopause so I have no idea what's up. My sister asked if it could be anxiety because I usually have insomnia and can have a really, really tough time getting to sleep some nights. 

Anyone else have hot flashes? I just immediately start feeling hot then I get super dehydrated."
2594,Anxiety,What materials and/or practices have helped you become virile/fearless or close to it? (+ my recent solution),"I have some fears that I'm truly ashamed of. One, for example, is that there's a big bridge near my house that goes probably 100 feet high without any shoulder, and it's such a cause of anxiety for me that I'll end up driving a much longer way around. Looking back over my life lately, I've realized I've been afraid over many things that other people haven't been.

HOWEVER, I recently was given a book called *No Easy Day*, which is the account of the Navy Seals who raided and killed Bin Laden, and the constant virility and toughness of these men has been so inspiring. After reading the author's thoughts/feelings/actions, I feel imprinted on in regards to those character traits, and it gives me this combative spirit towards fear that I've felt in small doses at times, but never to the order and magnitude that I get from this book. Over and over again you read him say something to the matter of ""a fear or useless thought entered my mind and I immediately forced it out,"" or when he verbally expresses a concern/doubt for something his comrades never let him live it down. In my perspective, these combative/virile practices almost seem like a direct link to negating fear. *They almost literally attack it in themselves, and when each other presents it.*

This may sound a stupid hypothesis, but hear me out and give me your two cents. My dad passed when I was a young kid, and when he was still here he traveled a lot for work, meaning I didn't have much bonding time with him or other males in the category of a male role model or as peers. Reading this book and realizing this effect makes me wonder if I simply didn't spend enough time with other males to build emotional and mental calluses/resilience (in a sense).

All that being said, I'm curious what books/materials have helped you the most, but I'm especially curious if any of you have seen positive effects in the same sort of manner that I am now. I've heard that neurolinguistic programming (NLP) is a great help in this regards, and that *Awaken the Giant Within* as well as the *Power of Positive Thinking* are at the top of the list in this category. Curious if anyone can vouch for that.

Sorry for the long post. I look forward to hearing what things have helped you all, and I hope my experience is something that you can try and benefit from, too.

&amp;#x200B;

PS: That bridge that I can never drive over, I drove over this week while giving it the same verbal abuse these soldiers have given each other. I know that sounds stupid. But the infiltration of the author's strong, visceral voice and personality is literally making me less fearful every day, and I'm starting to get a hunger for more fear-provoking experiences so I can make light of it. His voice is becoming mine in a sense (I know that sounds crazy, but I'm sure you know what I mean)."
2595,Anxiety,My anxiety is taking over,"Right now my mind is going a mile a minute and it won’t stop torturing me! 

For example :

- I’m freaking out about natural weather disasters. Like a volcano is going to erupt and burn my family or suffocate them. 

- Or am earthquake or just one of those giant earth holes that suddenly happen’ and we will fall into it and I can’t save anyone. 

It’s like I can’t breathe and it just feels that way all the time now. Half the time I want to pack up and move but I can’t seem to ever be good enough for bank approval and everywhere in the world that seems safe suddenly doesn’t look safe anymore. 

I don’t know how to feel or what to do. I’ve heard all the speeches “live in the now” “ if it happens it happens” those don’t make me feel better. The idea one of my children could die and I couldn’t save them is driving me to the point of wanting to vomit. 

I have good days where I just shove it all down but there are these nights where anxiety is just an all time high and I never know how to escape it’s grasp. 

Add in the nightmares when I do fall asleep I’m just tired.. so tired 😭"
2596,Anxiety,Sports performance and internalizing critical feedback,"Hi all. I'd be grateful for the chance to vent a little, and to get advice from any other members who suffer anxiety while also trying to play sports.

First, a little context: after a childhood of being very overweight, bullied, and having this exacerbate an already prominent anxiety disorder, I spent time working on myself in my 20s to a place of pretty okay physical and mental health. I'm still anxious as all hell, but I'm learning how to deal with that better: not always successfully, but better than before.

Two and a half years ago, I decided to push myself to my physical and mental limits by taking up women's Australian Rules football. If you're not familiar with it, it's a high paced, high contact game. You can't hide in it and you have to use your voice, which is what I'm trying to bring out of myself.

I run, mark, kick, handball and yell better than I thought possible when I first started. However, my coach always expects more and more of me (which is a good thing), but whenever she yells at me for doing the wrong thing or pulls me off and benches me for a quarter, all I can think about is how bad I am, and how other people must think I'm a failure. I see other fields who I know I'm better than in skills and fitness get game time, and I feel like I'm being singled out because I've failed so much in my performance. I can't get over how much I must be letting my coach down, and that I might just be a cowardly, lazy player.

I also hate the idea of upsetting someone, and I think how my coach must secretly hate me, is fed up with me, or doesn't see anything I might be doing well. Then I think that maybe I'm just stupid and pig headed, and maybe there's nothing great about me as a player at all 

I know I can't be the best, but I want to do well. And I don't know if I'm doing anything right by my team.

TL;DR - I'm putting myself out there physically and mentally, and all I can focus on is how everyone must think I'm a screw up."
2597,Anxiety,24/7 constant anxiety,I’ve always had a little anxiety from time to time but this whole past month has been like a constant anxiety loop of feeling like I’m dying and nothing I do can calm me. Nothing feels real anymore and I low key think I’m really on the verge of losing my mind. Has anyone else felt this and what are some ways to cope?
2598,Anxiety,I'm absolutely freaking out and I don't know what to do,"I was taking groceries in with my brothers and for whatever reason someone left a trash bag from the bathroom right next to the front door. I lifted the groceries I had in my hand over it and put them in the kitchen. When I came back downstairs, I saw both of my brothers drag the grocery bags they were holding against the trash bag. I started getting sick. The bag is transparent and you can literally see a tissue with poop on it inside. I don't know why they were just completely indifferent to that. I've been trying to tell myself the food is still ok to eat but I'm worried I'll end up just starving myself again this week. I looked at the bag and there was a red stain (I assume it was blood) on the OUTSIDE as well. This absolutely isn't irrational right? I mean it's fucking disgusting."
2599,Anxiety,"Most, if not all, of my anxiety stems from caffeine consumption","I honestly didn't realize how much it disabled me from life honestly. Like I was literally feeling like I was going to pass out and was on the edge of a panic attack every day. I couldn't do my job right, I didn't make many friends and I was sick. I cut caffeine out for the first time this week and I was actually answering phones at my job for the first time with no anxiety. I saw eye to eye with customers and I was able to converse with my coworkers for the most part. I didn't know one little substance that I was addicted to controled the way I present myself. Fuck I feel like I wasted so much of my life due to anxiety now that I think more about it."
2600,Anxiety,Why is every time I go out I feel like everyone is watching or judging me.,It’s so exhausting. I’m so paranoid that everyone is watching me and talking about me that I think it actually causes people to watch me and judge me because I’m constantly staring at them to check if they’re looking at me. I don’t know how to stop. I can’t even go to the corner shop anymore without thinking this.
2601,Anxiety,Waiting for a guy to pick something up off eBay from my house and I’m having an anxiety attack,I’m litterly crawling in my skin waiting for this guy to show up. Idk why I’m so nervous. My chest is extremely tight and I’m sweating intensely. Dam I hate anxiety
2602,Anxiety,terrified of job searching,"Is anyone else terrified of job searching? I don't mean interviewing. I just mean submitting applications. The very thought of it makes my heart pound. I spent the whole week lying in bed, basically sick with anxiety and avoidance. Ashamed of my paralysis, but unable to change it. 

My therapist asked me ""what's the worst thing that can happen?"" and I didn't have an answer. All I know is that when I think of looking for a job I feel actual terror. I mean, it hurts. My chest hurts. My throat closes up and I can't eat. Even with Sertraline, even with Buspirone. I'm so scared. And I'm almost 30. I'm too old for this shit..."
2603,Anxiety,Waves of panic attacks over the course of hours. What do you do during the COM to prevent another one?,"I think this is a fairly common experience. For most of my battle with anxiety, my panic attacks have been short. During particularly difficult times, I will have a panic attack, calm down, then have another one, calm down, repeat. Sometimes for more than an hour. It’s frustrating because I will get very calm between them sometimes. Is there anything I can do during this time period to prevent the next wave from coming? To stop being so easily triggered?

It’s really frustrating, because this kind of a panic attacks seem to only come at night. I have my old ones during the day and when they are done they are done. 

Nighttime is usually my time. My wife and son are asleep and I’ll do some things that are relaxing and just enjoy time to myself. But once the first panic attack hits, the night is pretty much ruined."
2604,Anxiety,Eyes water and go red when nervous,When talking to someone new I will be nervous as hell and my eyes will start to water like I’m crying. Idk if I’m just not blinking or it’s me crying 😂
2605,Anxiety,Videos or articles about GAD?,"I am wondering if anyone has links to videos or articles about GAD and how you can't just ""chill out"" or ""stop overthinking"". 


I am seeing this new guy and he is pretty wonderful but I went to see him yesterday and I was having a day where I was just anxious about everything and rethinking all my life choices and just couldn't stop playing the ""what if"" game. I know he means well but he is just a naturally chill guy and he keeps saying things like ""stop worrying what people think"" and ""just stop overthinking and make a choice"" along with every other cliche. He just doesn't get it and it has led to me getting horribly frustrated and tearing up because it just feels like he won't listen to me and he just dismisses what I say as though I am simply making excuses. 


Aside from that issue he has been wonderful and supportive so I would really love to try and get him to understand what exactly GAD is and why I can't just stop overthinking and freaking out about things. I know he will never fully understand but I am hopefully that even a little bit of understanding will help our relationship."
2606,Anxiety,The slightest things make me overthink.,"It’s so exhausting. I overanalyze everything. My boyfriend had a SUPER rough day. We’re now laying in bed and he asked me to rub his head to help him like unwind. So I did. And when I was rubbing his head, I kinda stopped for a minute and kinda put my head on his, and he sat up and moved my hand off of his head and now my brain is going into overdrive. I’m wondering if I did something wrong or if he just didn’t want to be touched anymore. I convince myself that he doesn’t like/love me anymore at least 3 times a day just based off of stupid stuff that a “normal” person probably wouldn’t even notice. I hate it here. And by here I mean in my head."
2607,Anxiety,Anxiety or a legitimate fear?,I have an obsessive fear about becoming old and unattractive and every woman I am attracted to becoming out of my reach. I am now 32 and I am losing my hair. I am constantly having meltdowns about it and family members have told me my issue is anxiety and that I need to take medications. But is this really the case? I feel like my fears make perfect sense and that what would be irrational would be to sit here and act like everything will be fine.
2608,Anxiety,I feel ugh sometimes,"So I have anxiety about my relationship. And I love my girlfriend the most, she's my rock, my best friend and I just don't wanna lose her. There is this other friend of mine who I talk to every now and then. We know each other from school.  
People in my social circle were always pressurizing me to make a move etc etc. I didn't want to cause I didn't feel that strongly for her and I didn't think I was ready for a relationship. And people pressurized me so much a few years back saying stuff like what are you getting out this friendship, make a move blah blah. At one point I was so anxious that I convinced myself that maybe I do like her. I was in 11th grade and I talked to her alot.But there was always the fear of rejection and also the fact that I didn't feel that strongly about her. But I pushed myself out of that hole and I was fine till a month back. I was watching a show with my now girlfriend and there was this line which went like ""I made myself get over you"". That line brought all the anxiety back and I'm fighting it and I'm better now but I don't want to feel so conflicted. I know without a shadow of a doubt that my girlfriend is the one I want to be with. But my mind keeps going crazy saying stuff like ""do I love her"", and everytime I said I love you to her it's like someone says ""no you don't ""and stuff like ""no you don't you love the other person"". I know I'm not lying to myself when I say I love her. I've been dating her for more than a year now and it started recently. I don't want to feel like this and I just found this subreddit and wanted to know if someone has been through the same. Also my girlfriend is very supportive and has her own anxiety which she deals with. I keep looking for a why knowing that this is just my anxiety grasping at straws to make me feel weird and self doubt myself. Anyways I just wanted to see if someone went through something similar and use this as an outlet to share my story"
2609,Anxiety,So freaking angry and anxious (a very long rant),"So I am very angry right now and its making me anxious that I might do something I'll regret. I am angry at my parents and brother. They all have just said little snide remarks that have rubbed me really wrong today. I usually just deal with the anger in the peace of my room but its not working. I feel like hurting someone and that's making me so anxious that I'm starting to go into a panic attack. I want to make it very clear, I DON'T WANT TO HURT ANYONE!!!! I am the least violent and non confrontational person I know. Its scaring me that I'm not controlling my anger how I normally do. I usually sit in my room listen to funny videos, calming music, or read to get my mind to relax and let the anger out. I tried all of these and breathing which usually works to stop the anxiety but nothing is working. I had a small tiff with my mom earlier over freaking cheese. I don't want to apologize to her because I feel like I did nothing wrong. All I did was disagree with her and she's the one who started to get mad. And then changed her mind and literally grabbed the flipping cheese out of my hand. Then later she had the audacity to say ""don't be mad at me"". Even though she the one who escalated the confrentation. And I just didn't feel like letting them walk all over me like I normally do. I really struggle with calling people out on their bs and usually let them say  things that hurt me. And just stay quiet and deal with it later. Which trust me I know it is not a good way to deal with anger or any negative emotion for that fact. This is just the way I have been dealing with it for who knows how long. Like I even had therapy today and talked a lot of this stuff out with my therapist. Felt nice and calm had a different perspective on how I was going to deal with their snide remarks. I was going to confront them a little but then the fight with my mom happened and everything fell to pieces. All the confidence I had built up during therapy imedetly crumbled. Sigh.... I think I was able to get most of the anger out by ranting. But that still leaves me with the anxiety. I don't do well when I get anxiety from anger. Like feeling anxiety about stuff is really normal for me. Even sliding into a panic attacks are normal, I can deal with those I have coping skills. I have was to distract myself and if I need to I can always talk to someone. But when it comes to anger the only ways I have ever known how to deal with them are yell louder then the other person to be heard or back off and shut up. Like my parents did try to teach me to take a break and talk about it later when you're calm. Which I can say is probably a healthy way of dealing with anger. But they never use it! And when I do it that just signals to them that they won the argument and that I was automatically wrong. It's very frustrating to feel like you have to constantly walk on eggshells or get yelled at. Which I forgot to mention is something that spikes my anxiety and I start to shut down mentally, socially, and emotionally. I cry and panic cause I don't handle loud noises and other peoples anger well. And then the flight part of anxiety kicks in and all I want to do is get away and hide. Which to someone who your having an argument with is an automatic ""win"" for them. Even if there is proof they are wrong, they still ""win"". But no one really ""wins"" during a fight. Everyone looses, but one party seems to feel as though they came out on top. I think I got all I needed to say out. If you read this far, sorry for taking up your time. Sometimes it just helps me to put my thoughts out there. Even if no one cares about but me. It's therapeutic. Also I'm feeling a lot calmer and no longer feel like hurting someone. Which is good, but this post took me like an hour to write. I'm a little obsessive over trying to make my writing good. Even during a rant post. Like I probably proof read it over a dozen times. Which may have helped me calm down a bit. Again I'm sorry for taking any of your time."
2610,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious about the imaginary conversations they have?,"I know 100% that it isn't real but it started out as a 15 y/o when I didn't have any friends and I made up people (usually from shows/movies/books) that I could talk to. I would imagine they say all the right things and felt a ""rush"" when I talked to myself.

7 years later, I have been medicated and diagnosed with depression/anxiety which sucked. The only habit I have now is that I still talk to these people except now, the conversation feels good in the beginning but eventually goes crazy.

I feel like I'm acting in a way where even these imaginary people would be judging me. I keep trying to convince them how I'm fine but unless my mind lets me, I can't be at peace. I sometimes have to repeat the scenario again and again to satiate myself.

When my anxiety is low, I am fine but it gets worse even when I'm ""happy"" or just exercised."
2611,Anxiety,Current bout of Insomnia,"Well, I was feeling great for a week there but currently in a super rough spot.

Anyway, here is kind of where I’m at:
It’s 3am and I just woke up after about only 2 hours of sleep with extreme panic and anxiety. Last night was similar - slept for about 3 hours and woke up with panic and couldn’t fall back asleep. I feel like I’ve been running on fumes and have been exhausted as hell but just can’t sleep due to this crazy panic I’ve been feeling. Like the type of panic that makes me feel nauseous and terrified for no reason.

Without going into too many details my sleeping conditions have changed very temporarily due to me having to go to a wedding, so I haven’t been at my normal apartment which could be a big factor. Also, I generally don’t have sleep issues from my anxiety and usually I over-sleep so when it’s the reverse and I can’t fall or stay asleep it’s extra scary to me which just exacerbates everything.

I guess all I can really do is just keep trying to sleep but it seems like it will be another night of virtually no sleep. Hoping this bout of insomnia is short lived. I feel bad for those of you who have to deal with this all the time :("
2612,Anxiety,"No, You Don't Have To Get Over It!",[removed]
2613,Anxiety,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick."," During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it."
2614,Anxiety,Anyone else can knly breathe when yawning?,"I suffer from anxiety, and I think it's eaither that or stress induced. I've gone to the doctor and there was nothing wrong with me.

It's been like this for about a year now, though it's gotten worse over the past week, since school started. At this point I kind of ignore it. I get worried when I wake up, but over the course of the day I just... Get used to it I guess.

Imagine having an anxiety attack, but only the breathing/pressure on your chest stuff. It feels like my chest is both empty and being crushed at the same time. The only way I can take a deep breath is when I yawn and inhale at the same time.

Anyone else have this or is it just me?"
2615,Anxiety,I think I had an anxiety attack,"Last night I was doing some work and suddenly I felt an irresistible itch in my scalp, it was so strong that I was almost going mad over it. I then asked my Mom to help me oil my it. The itch subsided but then I could feel my heart pounding and I had a feeling of nervousness and fear. I measured my Blood Pressure then and it turned out to be 155/80. I later took some BP regulatory medicines and was laying down and then suddenly I burst into tears. I felt as if my life has been shit and I have never been happy I just wanted to cry and cry and cry. i don't know what's happening with me. Can anyone please help me?"
2616,Anxiety,"I’m terrified that something bad is going to happen. I don’t know what, but I’m scared of it anyway.","I’m happy. I am actually happy.  
  
I graduated last year and I have a job in my field. My volunteer work in tutoring kids with special needs is starting back up again. I live with my kind, loving boyfriend and our beautiful little cat.  
  
I want to be thankful, and I kind of am, but I’m scared that something bad will happen because how can the world just allow me to be happy?"
2617,Anxiety,Has the pandemic made anyone else scared of going outside at all?,"Like I know objectively that chances of transmission outside are extremely low. But I am terrified to go outside for a walk. I feel like I am so nervous because of the anti-maskers in my area. Every time I go anywhere where a mask is required, I see at least one douchebag who is apparently happy to infect the whole world with their gross breath lol. So I feel like I am so distrusting of the people around since. 

But I really should go out and get some sun and exercise. Help?"
2618,Anxiety,I asked a guy for his snapchat today!,"Social interactions, especially those with strangers, scare me shitless. Making a move on a complete stranger is something I’d never do. But today was different. This guy had the most contagious smile; it was comforting, really. So, I decided to go up to him and ask for his snap. He actually ended up saying no as he has a girlfriend, but it, surprisingly, didn’t even phase me. This is so unlike me dude, I avoid situations like this at all costs, but I did it easily. And him rejecting me would typically be something to take a toll on my breathing, make my face all hot and red, etc. but we both laughed it off and I walked away. I don’t even recognize myself today (in the best way possible!) I just feel really good about this and thought I’d share:-)"

2621,Anxiety,Everytime I get an anxiety attack it feels like a heart attack,"I sleep a lot because just to not feel it. People think I’m lazy or I’m exaggerating, my boyfriend used to help me with it but now he says he doesn’t have the energy anymore and it hurts. When I get anxiety attacks they usually lasts for days. If they’re really bad I’ll even puke and then eating becomes a scary thing for me. It also makes my thoughts spiral and I hate it I just want it to go away. Sometimes I just want to rip my heart out so I won’t feel any of it. I have to hide it too which makes me feel lonely.

I’ve dealt with many anxiety symptoms before but lately I’ve been waking up with my body shivering, increased heart rate, confused, and feeling quite cold.

I had bloodwork done about a month  ago and thankfully I’m completely healthy so I wanted to know if I should go back and get more studies done of if it really is just my anxiety and lack of sleep.

2625,Anxiety,I think I made it!,"Look.... I’ve still got a long way to go, but I’ve been steadily getting better. Today feels like the pinnacle, the top of Everest, that place I thought I’d ever get to.

My anxiety journey started 5 months ago. Due to stress at work and at home, I started having little panic attacks over the space of the year before which got stronger and stronger, longer and longer. Until one day just before picking the kids up from school, I had a full blown meltdown type panic attack, the walls were closing in, my chest tight, my heart pounding, my stomach, nauseous. I had my little girl with me and I tried with every fibre in my body to not let her see I was struggling. I got to the school, as dizzy as a drunk elephant and I phoned my partner, my first words in think I’m dying’ 

I finally collected the kids in a hurry hoping the teachers wouldn’t see how mental I was and try to section me. I got home, my mother in law arrived and I just broke down in want to be normal’ I kept saying. I finally calmed down, but spent the next 24hours expecting an imminent attack. They came but went quite quickly. I agreed to go to the doctor.

The next day I get to the surgery have the chat with the doctor, he prescribed me anti depressants. I also have bloods done and an ecg as I have been convinced since my childhood I was going to have an heart attack.

All was fine but I had high cholesterol, great! I have to worry about that now. I wanted to take my anti depressants in the morning, by now this was late afternoon. My mother, who is also on AD’s told me take one that night and then in the morning and go from there. My god do I think that was the biggest mistake of my life. The next evening I had the mother of all panic attacks, I couldn’t calm down, it lasted for 36 hours and a trip to A &amp; E. I was checked over and given some diazepam. I got home popped one and slept for what felt like a year.

After I woke up I felt like my nervous system was on fire, my body was buzzing and vibrating and I had racing thoughts, thoughts of harming my family, suicidal feelings, hopelessness, scared and fearful feeling.

This went on for months, I thought I was going crazy, I’d started a new job which was much less stressful, but it was so hard when I had all of this going on, everyday was a struggle and right in the middle of lockdown in the UK. I prayed that everyday, I could just get to 7pm and get into bed with my partner, where I felt safe but still had these horrible things happening. Every day I prayed I would wake up and be back to my old self, everyone kept saying, the tablets will make you worse before you get better. 

I tried everything, I taught myself CBT techniques, meditation, exercise, yoga, diet, supplements, NoFap. Nothing worked! If anything it made them worse. I constantly felt like I had an electric prod, plugged in to my central nervous system, I was a wreck.  How I got through those days, I still don’t know. The suicidal thoughts increased (I have never had one suicidal thought in my life). I was convinced I had a range of disorders. Psychosis, ptsd (I do have this after my sister was murdered 5 years ago) depression, gad, panic disorder, hocd etc.

I came off the tablets roughly 6 weeks ago after I tapered myself. I started at 50mg and after 3 weeks, told my gp I think they’re making me worse, he upped them to 100mg. I was hopeful at the time but boy do I regret it! After another month, I told him it wasn’t working, he wanted to up them to 150mg, not again mate! I suggested tapering off, he strongly suggested against it. I knew my body, it was screaming to get this poison out of me! 

I tapered off over a 3 week period. I should have taken longer, but I wanted them gone. Boy we’re the Ssri withdrawal Forums right. Everything multiplied the first few weeks. But I slowly started getting better, and yes I know, looking back it was the AD’s making my anxiety worse. I really feel like if I hadn’t kept up the meditation, yoga, exercise, supplements etc. I would still be in that horrible place. I also drink a lot of teas which have helped, redbush, camomile, lemon and ginger. 

I wrote this as I think if I had seen a post like this when I was in the midst of it I think I would have cried with joy."

I feel like if I don’t accomplish what I wanted in life on the first try I’m a failure. All this money spent for nothing. What’s the use if I’m not constantly perfect? God I need help, I need so much help. This is going to consume me and end up killing me. Whether by my own hand or the physical harm done by the stress I endure.

2633,Anxiety,Mental health,"Hey everyone,
Reddit is a safe space so here i go.
I have noticed,
 if there is a conversation that i am a part of but currently doing something else. My mind tends to subconsciously keep thinking about the conversation that might or might not be going on!
This problem hinders my ability to focus on the task i am currently doing, and i until i go and see the what was going on my mind won't attain peace ( not sure why).
So the outline of my problem is subconsciously my minds wanders into things that may or may not exist which hinders my work and ability to focus.
What do you guys think i should do and does that mean i am mentally weak?!"
2634,Anxiety,Anxiety attacks,I hear a lot of ppl say when they get anxiety attacks there muscles tighten and they nearly start to cry but for me I just get awful pains in my heart a few palps maybe skipped beats to and u feel like I’m choking on air. Awfully scary when lying in bed and they seem to come for no reason my anxiety is mainly physical and I feel I could beat it but I don’t know what’s causing it like I’m an outgoing person definitely don’t have social anxiety but my anxiety is constantly worsening. Can anyone relate to emitter of these points?

2636,Anxiety,Should I quit my job?,"Hi all,
I've had the most crippling anxiety I've ever had this year. I've been unable to leave the house without having an anxiety attack (sweating, nausea, shaking, dissociating etc etc).
I am supposed to return to my retail job in 3 days (after being furloughed for 6 months) and I am absolutely terrified. I would love to be able to work but my physical symptoms and literally unbearable, I cant imagine myself walking into work and not having some sort of breakdown 

Now here's where I'm quite lucky, I'm also going back to uni in October and I'm in the UK so I get a maintenance loan, which will cover all my living expenses and leave me with some money leftover. I'm just worried come the summer I'll need a job again and wont be able to find one. 

I'm also worried about actually quitting my job, that seems more terrifying than actually sticking it out, does anyone have any advice or anything? I just feel incredibly stuck and alone"
2637,Anxiety,How do i stop overthinking everything,My anxiety hasnt gotten so bad that i overthink the smallest possible interactions. I’ve even started having worse intrusive thoughts that i have absolutely no control over and it feels like someone else is controlling me. I feel so bad for everyone around me including my bf for being this way but i dont know any coping mechanisms that will work for me i just want the thoughts to stop :/
2638,Anxiety,Post on Reddit triggered me badly :/,"I feel dumb posting that title because in my head I just thought “stop being so weak.” But I’m really struggling. 

Anyway, there was a YSK post that was basically like “if you are itchy for no apparent reason, it could be cancer” and it went into this person’s experience with lymphoma. With comments from other people confirming their experience with it. It sent me into a huge panic attack, and I’ve been psychosomatically itchy ever since, and I’m really struggling. 

Before reading that post, I got all my moles checked because one in particular on my arm was giving me anxiety (and my arm hurt the week before the appointment, which automatically went away after the doctor reassured me the mole was fine. Which confirms that the arm pain was psychological because I haven’t had it since). 

The doctor checked all my moles and said they were fine. There was one in particular that my doctor said was “perfectly round” and definitely fine. The doctor gave me some guidelines on when to be concerned about a mole, one including “if it gets itchy.” 

I have dry, itchy skin in general. I was scratching near the “perfectly round” mole, and scratching over the mole area felt different than scratching the rest of my skin. Which, sent me into a panicky downward spiral. 

And then I read the reddit post. 

And now I’ve been itchy in that area on and off ever since. 99% of the time I’m not itchy on that mole, just in some vague area near it. I know it’s in my head because it was triggered by that post. I just want the sensation to turn off like my arm pain did.

I almost want to delete reddit because it’s not the first time I’ve been triggered by a post. But then there’s subs like this that are really helpful. Idk what to do. The initial post was on “wholesome” because of how the person’s cancer was in remission. Then I saw their YSK post. Like how tf am I supposed to know what subs are triggers and what to unfollow when a trigger was on the wholesome subreddit?!! Like fuck. 


TL;DR: post on Reddit about cancer has made me have psychosomatic symptoms and I’m really struggling. I know that they are psychosomatic because I’ve had psychosomatic symptoms in the past that went away instantly after having doctor confirmation that I was fine. I’m struggling with the current set of psychological symptoms. 

For what it’s worth, I am seeing a therapist. My original one retired, so I have an initial onboarding appointment with a new one coming up."
2639,Anxiety,We went to the beach with my parents today,I was so anxious i did not enjoy that at all it feels like evry people is judging me i hate them.
2640,Anxiety,"sorry if this is kind of stupid but, I really need to call #PMT for my Verizon wireless plan thing to put in a refill card but im way too scared to. is it an actual person or is it a machine on the other end?",
2641,Anxiety,i forgave myself for binge eating!!!,
2642,Anxiety,notice the physical signs!,"i don’t know about you guys but my anxiety has evolved to just a lot of disossocation and it’s the worst! my therapist always recommends noticing the physical signs and calming yourself down. like breathing through your chest, pulling your legs close to your body (trying to make yourself smaller), temperature changes, etc. and once you notice them remind yourself that you are not in danger and that you are safe!!!!"
2643,Anxiety,Nausea every day,"every night And every morning when i wake up i have to throw up , i have acid reflux so i used to only have sore throat in the morning but now i have nausea for the past 2 weeks"
2644,Anxiety,Confused if my boyfriend ever found me attractive when we met ?,"Guys I know this sounds insecure asf, I don’t know why it started out of no where in my thoughts. I have anxiety but I never have had this type !! So please don’t judge if sound like an idiot.

So I take allot photos for Instagram and I remember I used to get inspo from girls that looked similar to me . So I remember when me and my bf first starting dating I was asking him if particular photos of these models look good as in their style (so I would know if the style or hair would suit me) 
Anyways he would be like “yeah it would suit u but idk cause she not my type” (btw there was actually a misunderstanding the first few times because he thought I was asking about the model when I was asking about the style, I never implied “hey babe is the model hot”, lol I’m actually scared to ever do that and wouldn’t have the guts to ask nor would I wanna know ) 
Anyways I cleared it up. And that misunderstanding was gone. 

I never really over thought about what he said. Cause I mean it just never got to me. I didn’t care cause he loves me. 
Also his celeb crush is someone that looks similar to me (some youtuber girl apart of those couple channels) similarly to some other YouTube/ celeb crushes he has. But there was something that would bother me. Like when we would watch their YouTube videos sometimes he would be like “babe she used be my biggest crush but your like a better looking version of her”. Idk why like i didn’t care or wanna know. This actually made me less confident. And the thing is I never ever asked him to compare me.
So I know he’s definitely attracted to me now but Idk why I’m just not sure if he was before ? So it’s weird cause this whole stupid worry didn’t start until 2 weeks ago when he was on Instagram and was like “ damn babe this looks like u “ which is weird cause they look so similar to the models I showed him. Anyways i was like okay. I think he even showed me the one that he said wasn’t his “type”. But I didn’t care. 

Until this morning in my random thoughts,  why this was the first time I ever felt anxious about this. And weird I ended up actually having insecure thoughts. I then started thinking what if the girls that he actually liked were just altered barbie versions of me ? Like what if that’s what he wanted to me to look like. Maybe he was being sarcastic when saying “ I looked better” I can’t blame him, I mean we all can be attracted to other people. Idk wtf is wrong me these past 2 weeks. 
So I was kinda quiet for a few days. It’s not his fault. It’s my stupid thought that started out of no where. So it wasn’t until I confronted him in a nice way and bought it up which I struggled to. 
He immediately looked extremely shocked and started explaining that I’m taking it the wrong way, he mentioned that when he mentioned a particular model wasn’t his type (during the misunderstanding) he just meant specific features model had which were different to mine or some I showed him , he didn’t think looked like me at all. 

I felt sooo bad cause I’m not the type of girl to ever do this. I mentioned idk why I was feeling insecure and he cleared that up too and apologised for showing me the model but obviously it wasn’t his fault!! 
I feel like maybe it was my fault for the whole misunderstanding we had. Like I swear I never showed him those photos to test him to anything!! That wasn’t my intention at all. 
He comforted me and ensured I’m worrying way too much. He also apologised for the comparing and said he actually wasn’t being sarcastic and just thought he was hyping me up. And has told me he wouldn’t do it again. I just ensured him that he can compliment me just as me aha.
So we solved it guys. 

But idk why even tho I’m getting better i still feel a bit anxious that I probably enabled this but I had no intention to! I haven’t taken any photo the past 2-3 weeks :/ I just feel so weird.
Also guys just to be clear when we dated it was more our connection and vibe so please don’t think he’s a dickhead or anything. He’s an amazing boyfriend and apologised. Other than this incident we are very good! 
It’s just me honestly, I don’t wanna ever have that anxiety feeling again. Just need some tips on how to manage this type of anxiety"

2646,Anxiety,"Does anyone else with anxiety and ADHD constantly open apps/Netflix to stop thinking, only to get bored/distracted within twenty seconds leaving you with the anxiety you started with and seemingly no way to evade it",
2647,Anxiety,Boyfriend not talking to me because of his depression. Not sure how much longer I can cope.,"My boyfriend has depression and stopped taking his meds four weeks ago. He’s been slowly getting worse since then. He kept saying he was going to go back to the doctors but didn’t. The last few days he has been pretty much ignoring me. I sent him a message saying night and that I love him and he just puts night he won’t say I love you back and it’s killing me. 

Apart form doing streaks on Snapchat he’s not talking to me at all. He lives with his grandparents so when I got up this morning I messaged his gran and explained the situation. She said she didn’t realise he wasn’t taking his meds and thanked me so much for letting her know. They booked him an emergency doctors appointment and he went this morning I presume. I kinda feel guilty though like I went behind his back. His gran said she wouldn’t mention the message to him.

At this point I don’t know what to do. His grandparents said he’s been off with them too and I know he was funny with his sister when I was around the other day. I bumped into his mum yesterday and even she said he is in one of his “grumps”. Still keep thinking I’ve done something wrong and some how this is all my fault. I did ask him if I upset him and he said no. He’s still coming on Facebook a lot so he obviously isn’t ignoring everyone. He’s talking to someone and he’s playing video games and posting on his story about stuff he’s doing so seems happy enough so my head goes to it just being me he doesn’t want to talk to. I don’t know how much longer I can cope with this though. I can’t sleep, can’t eat. I’m starving and exhausted but just feel sick to my stomach. Just keep switching from feeling numb and crying my eyes out."
2648,Anxiety,"I don’t really know how to manage this COVID crisis, apparently.","It seems to most people around me (and now to me as well) that I have an exaggerated and a somatic response to COVID. I’ve had, in varying degrees but almost permanently throughout at least 3 months, throat pain. I’ve had two negative COVID results, after which, each time, I thought I relaxed for a bit and went away, but then it always came back with strength. I consulted a regular physician and took antibiotics for the regular throat pain fueling diseases out there, like the common flu (it’s winter here right now). But nothing: it persists. 
I have what some believe to be exaggerated cleaning habits, but I do see people, respecting protocols. Yet there are unmanageable instances. For example, (this one is manageable, but many are not) last night a friend talked without masks (I didn’t have mine either, since we were having dinner) just too close to my face. So now I feel like I have to start a strict 14-day quarantine because it was a risky situation... and because I have a sore throat again (since right after she talked to me this way). It was rough to realize, as well, I wasn’t able to ask her to step back (she was showing me photos on her phone for some long minutes), as I just couldn’t found the words to say it,l without feeling it was kind of violent; to me it was a very uncomfortable situation. Another factor to add to the mix.
The point is: I feel like this basically every time I’m around people; I make deep cleaning of my house anytime anybody enters, I’ve had not one but two tests so far ( I might add I’m the only person I know who has had a test at all, and for most of my acquaintances thats true as well). 
I know my friend shouldn’t talk to me so close, I know I and everyone else can effectively catch COVID in multiple ways, but the thing is I’m living in a somehow paranoid state of mind that can’t be good. I might add I’ve started acupuncture, which hasn’t  been of much use so far, and that I’m doing therapy, but my therapist hasn’t really dived in this aspect -not that I’ve brought it up much though, I didn’t think it was something worth mentioning much until now, when I realize each minor posible transgression triggers both a renewed paranoia and my throat pain. Well, this is just a rant, I understand this is difficult for all of humanity. Thanks for reading."
2649,Anxiety,(potential trigger) realising the effects of social media,"I've been visiting my psychologist since February for OCD and Anxiety and I made so much progress over the course of the last 6 months, and for the first time in so long, I could actually catch a break from my mind and feel good. But I just saw a TikTok of someone who was feeling low and I started to remember how that felt and how much I suffered in that time, and instantly, it was like 6 months of progress had immediately been erased. I feel so shit for no reason and I haven't felt this low in so long. I just want a break.

&amp;#x200B;

I used to be confused about why trigger warnings were necessary but I absolutely understand now. I think it's time to take a break from Instagram and Tiktok."
2650,Anxiety,Work pressures and coping mechanisms,"I work a desk job which has short deadlines and ruthless expectations. While I want to quit this job, I can't do it at the moment due to the pandemic.

Till the time I can bid this hell good bye, I would like to know how do you generally cope with work stress and anxiety.

I have reached the stage where every work call gives me anxiety. One day it got so bad that I collapsed due to exhaustion. Then while I was on the ground, the boss called again. I picked up and he started telling me what work he wants me to do. I felt utterly broken. I've been working weekends since 2 months. With very few days of rest and relaxation. It's taking its toll on me and making me feel deporsonized. I feel like I'm someone else just living in an alien body. It's crushing me.

How do you cope with all this?

I try meditation, deep breathing, cardio exercises. But overall it hasn't helped much."
2651,Anxiety,Covid anxiety,So for the last 2-3 days my throat has felt dry and itchy not so much hurting. And that’s the only symptom I have as of right now. How common is this as a first symptom? I’m 22 and terrified I will die of covid.
2652,Anxiety,What is wrong with me? Need advice,"So i’m a 18 y/o girl and I really get tense around people I know, I don’t have lots of friends but when I meet with my friends or my relatives I just get tense, even sometimes my hands are starting to shake for no reason??? I cant even think properly. When meeting is over I’m overthinking about everything I said and did like ‘What I just said was stupid or not?’ ‘Do they think that I’m cringy and weird?’ And there is no reason for me to think like this bc nothing ever happens and no one says anything about me. I’m just thinking a lot about what people are thinking about me even I don’t like them.
Its like everyone is judging me.
Quarantine was like a hell for me because of overthinking.How can I stop this and relax?

Sorry for my bad english btw"
2653,Anxiety,I desperately need someone to talk to.,"I am evacuated from my town from a serious natural disaster. I'm in one of the biggest cities in the US temporarily by myself for now. I am so stressed out because I'm scared of being alone. I have health anxiety and im scared something will happen to me.

I *feel* like I was kicked out of my hotel yesterday morning because the worker did not handle my situation. I had an agreement with a manager but this lady decided she would dismiss the agreement. The whole reason I was able to stay there was because of the exception they made for me. Once the lady took away the exceptation, I HAD to leave. I go back up in my car just balling my eyes out to see my tire is flat. I had to call roadside assistance to air it up. I was referred to get my tire plugged. Turns out I need all four tires replaced because of them balding. 

I'm so stressed out to the point that I'm literally sick to my stomach. I dont want to get out of bed. Im so nauseous, I feel like I almost threw up a few times. Im tired from lack of sleep. Im hot. Im just really really tired. I want to go home. My husband is away right now visiting his brother and I stupidly reassure myself when im with him because he is a safe zone for me. Now he's not here and im not handling this well. 

I really want to go home. I cant go home for a few weeks until we have electricity back on for the town. I need someone to talk to so bad. Please"

2657,Anxiety,Did anyone else go from clinical depression in their younger years and now have extreme anxiety instead?,"This is a weird question but I was wondering if anyone was similar to myself. As a kid and teenager I had really awful depression with just a bit of anxiety. I was constantly suicidal. I tried medications and therapy, neither worked. I would sleep all day and miss school because of it. It was really awful. I had heightened anxiety for sure but I would never say it was ruining my life. Come my mid-20s and I have very little depression but crippling anxiety. Im completely MISERABLE from my anxiety but somehow suicide hasn't even crossed my mind. I dont feel sad either. I feel frustrated and apathetic instead. It's so strange looking back on my old personality. It sounds bad but I think I'd take the depression over this anxiety. Anxiety is literally so PHYSICALLY and mentally painful. It keeps me up all night. I think I'm experiencing symptoms of sleep deprivation at this point. At least with depression all I did was sleep. 

I know brain chemistry changes as you age so I was wondering if this was a common transition."

2659,Anxiety,Twitter account,"I made a twitter account in 2013 when I was like 8, and now I’m humiliated because of the things I put on there. I’m afraid someone will find it and humiliate me. I also have an embarrasing Instagram and Facebook. I can try to ignore it’s existance but It haunts me. What can I do to erase it? I made the account 7 years ago and I was 8 so naturally I have a different Email and number. Is anyone embarrased by this?"
2660,Anxiety,Can’t quite sleep but not quite awake,"So tonight I get to bed about 10pm and sort-of doze but it’s not like I’m awake but I’m not asleep either, it’s not like I’m actually going to get to sleep in this state. My mind is just churning through thoughts, almost like I’m forced to watch a movie as my thoughts go by. Feels like A Clockwork Orange forced viewing.

There are definitely some things I’m stressed and anxious about at the moment but the thoughts are nothing in particular, some recent events, some thinking about what I’ll do tomorrow, some thinking about conversations I’ve had or will have, some of it even re-playing or thinking about things in a Netflix show I’ve been watching - really just a random muddled mix of rumination, it’s not like I’m dwelling on any one thought or source of anxiety.

This happens from time to time, when it does it’s quite frustrating as I’m often not conscious enough to do anything about it, sometimes it feels as if I’m observing myself doing it but can’t quite make the move to get up and readjust myself. So tonight it went until  now, I snapped myself out of it, it’s just after 2 am, now I’m sitting on my bed, drinking a tea that’s meant to help promote sleep, I’m going to meditate for a short while and then try again to get to sleep.

(I know... I shouldn’t be on my phone, looking at a screen right before trying to get some much needed sleep)

I imagine there are others here that experience this weird ruminating not quite asleep/not quite awake ruminating sensation?"

I came across one article that said fluoxetine is alright to put in food, just not the Prozac weekly?... I’m really new to all of this medication as I’ve never been on it before and am feeling a bit frazzled because I NEED to take it but fear I won’t be able to :("
2663,Anxiety,Do you ever feel a lot more immature than other people your age?,"I’ve pretty much dealt with severe anxiety all my life and I’m just starting to notice how like immature I am compared to others my age (I’m 21). There are people my age with full time jobs, with kids, have their own place, etc. and I don’t even have my drivers license and I’ve never even had a job before as I’ve always been so in my head.

So I decide to go and buy some clothes cause I don't have many clothes that fit me anymore but when I go looking I keep getting anxiety cause I feel greedy going to buy things for myself and also I dont like other people knowing what I'm buying. I know people probably don't give a shit but the feeling never seems to go away. I fucking hate myself.
2665,Anxiety,I don’t want to move,"I feel like in this sub people are a lot more understanding, so I’m posting this here. My parents are older now and are closing on a house in Florida and the idea of moving to Florida makes me sick. It’s too hot there and being from the Northeast, I just love the seasons. And although I am 21, I really do not feel ready to move out and I don’t have money of my own. I feel as though it is easy for people to tell me ‘to just grow up’ but like people don’t really understand how much anxiety can set you back. Like if I could- I would move out but a) I don’t have a job, b) even if I did find roommates, that’s still a big undertaking and c) I just don’t feel mature enough to live on my own. 

Like I really don’t want to move to Florida but at the same time I have to respect my parents wishes but the idea of moving to Florida makes me sick. Thankfully, I still have three more semesters left of college but really all I can unfortunately think about is moving to Florida and how the current house will sell. But then I think that I sound really spoiled, immature and entitled with like a lot of things of I’m thinking. Like I’m 21 throwing a fit about moving meanwhile there are people out there all on their own. I just- I don’t know what to do. 

I tried posting something like this on another sub, but someone commented ‘just grow up’, which I obviously know but having severe ocd and anxiety makes things a lot more complicated. 

I don’t know- I guess I will just need to suck it up but every day I’m nearly crying over the idea of moving: I don’t really talk to my parents about how I feel because at the end of the day this is their life and they are older now. They are seem so happy- I don’t want to drain from their happiness."

I dunno if it's a physical representation of stress that I'm holding, depression, or what. It's like I cant relax, there is always this tight heavy feeling in my chest no matter how much I relax the rest of my body. Like my arteries are clogged or something.

I've tried to introspect and see what the cause is with no luck. I can strip every possible cause away and go down to like the absolute core level of my being, like a clear gel shaped like the outline of my body. In computer terms down to the BIOS level. But even at that level I'm still wearing this gold pendant over my heart that is coated with black sludge.

Also generally have a lack of energy and motivation. Basic bloodwork says I dont have hypothyroidism or diabetes or any vitamin deficiencies. Maybe chronic fatigue or maybe I'm just lazy idk. That's less of a concern right now. First I just want to lighten up this heavy feeling in my chest and be free again."
2670,Anxiety,My anxiety over my friendships is controlling my life,"Interested to hear if anyone here can relate or knows how to deal with this...

So I’ve always placed a really high value on my friendships - possibly even more than my romantic relationships in some ways. When I was younger I was obsessed with the idea of having a “best friend” and I devoured any books or films which had the theme of close-knit friendships at their core (stuff like babysitters club and anything by Jaqueline Wilson). I don’t know where this need came from exactly, but it caused me to develop some very unhealthy, toxic friendships throughout my childhood and teenage years - friendships based in feelings of possessiveness, jealousy, and codependency to extreme levels, and which probably caused a lot more harm than good in the long run. Each of these friendships ended in them “betraying” me in some way (cheating with my boyfriends, letting huge secrets of mine slip, abandoning me when I needed them and so on).

Today, while I’m no longer *quite* so intense, I still care very deeply about my friends. I try to show it however I can - I’m supportive, always available when they need me, I celebrate their successes and I keep their secrets faithfully. I’m immensely proud of them when they do well and while I recognise their faults and don’t put them on pedestals, I love and celebrate them for who they are - as I’d want them to do for me. 

However I know I can also be idealistic and that I expect too much from my friends. I want us to always be open and honest with each other, and for the appreciation and dedication to be mutual. I hold them to very high esteem and their judgement means a lot to me. I recently had a huge success in my life which one of my closest friends hasn’t even acknowledged, and the pain of it is almost physical. I just want my friends to love me and I want to know that they aren’t going to abandon me. 

And when I start picking up on signs that all might not be well - I freak out. 

Though I try not to let it show, I get panicky and anxious. I can’t rest until normality resumes. I have to hold myself back from asking “what’s wrong?? Why aren’t you texting me? Why are you behaving differently? Have I done something to upset you??” This sends me into a spiral of anxiety and self-doubt - I turn to unhealthy coping mechanisms like binge eating, drinking or even self harm in extreme cases. I don’t know why I react this way and I don’t know how to stop. 

I’ve lost friendships in the past due to them not being honest with me about my own failings. A couple of years ago, a person I thought was my best friend in the world blew up on me over something tiny - he threw several years’ worth of built up resentments back at me, incidents from the very beginning of our friendship where I’d had no idea that I had hurt him (as he never expressed it at all). He used some of my deepest fears and insecurities against me and it was horrible. Even when I tried to apologise and diffuse the situation, the hateful texts kept on coming until I blocked him. We haven’t spoken since. 

I have always struggled with conflict and feelings of insecurity and anxiety when others seem upset at me - but now I pick up on the slightest signs and my mind goes nuts. 

I’m starting to worry that this anxiety has led me to being a really toxic friend - the sort of person you feel you *can’t* be honest with because they’ll overreact and never let it drop, or they’ll withdraw from you entirely. I saw a graphic the other day about “signs that you are the toxic friend” and I felt like I do all of them - I give the silent treatment when I’m unhappy (because I don’t want to make things worse/I’m terrified of arguing), I’m jealous of my friends’ other friends (“I bet they like them more than they like me”), I’m possessive (I get upset when I don’t know where they are/what they’re doing), I give unsolicited advice (just “trying to help” - isn’t that what friends should do when you present them with a situation/problem?), etc, etc. I try so hard to be a good friend and a non-toxic person but I feel like I just have too much tangled up inside me. 

Take this week for example - my normally chatty “best friend” has been taking her time in replying to my texts. Her manner is suddenly different - she is using lots of emojis and exclamation marks, something which historically has been a sign that she’s annoyed about something and doesn’t really want to talk to me. Where usually she’d be warm, conversational and thoughtful, her tone has changed to be flippant, offhand and overly upbeat. I’m not sending her messages about anything serious or deep, but I still can’t shake the sense that I’ve done something to piss her off and she’s sick of my shit. I feel desperate and panicky, my mind is racing trying to think what I’ve done wrong. I’m trying to think of excuses to text her so I can keep assessing whether she’s being off with me, I’m turning my phone onto airplane mode so that I won’t even see if she replies or not. I don’t know whether to ignore it or address it, as she tends to get very defensive and finds over-emotional displays off putting and annoying. My rational brain is saying - she’s just busy, she’s trying to have a break from her phone, she’s got something else on her mind (“but why wouldn’t she tell me???” my possessive self cries!) It could be anything or nothing. For me though, it’s all I can think about.

Does anyone else struggle with this sort of anxiety and insecurity around friendships? Where do you think it comes from and what have you found helpful to cope? I hate how much other people’s’ moods affect my life - I can’t rest if I feel someone is annoyed with me and it’s controlling my life. It makes me want to not have friends at all - I don’t want to be this needy, obsessive, anxious, jealous person. But I don’t know how to stop."
2671,Anxiety,Quitting caffeine has been a game changer for me,"So for the last year or so my anxiety has taken a turn for the worst. It's gotten extremely severe. 24/7 I was in a fight or flight state and it got so bad that I would have severe panic attacks every night to the point where I was violently shaking and soaking my sheets in sweat (these could last from 30 minutes to hours). I had an obsession with the fear of developing psychosis to the point where it was on my mind 24/7 and caused severe anxiety. I was in a dissociative state constantly. I'm on an anxiety med (Buspar), and while it has helped, it's not a magic pill. It didn't do nearly enough.

Well I thought about doing something I've tried in the past but failed to maintain: cutting caffeine from my diet. I have gone about a month and a half without caffeine. For the first few days it wasn't easy. I felt like my anxiety had almost gotten worse. Soon after though I started getting slightly better. The dissociative state was nearly gone. I felt alive again. The constant fight or flight state had basically become a thing of the past. I didn't have a single panic attack. I'm not going to BS you and say it was a miracle cure. I still was anxious in public and had intrusive thoughts a lot. But it was toned down slightly, and my baseline anxiety was massively reduced. I'm in a state now where I'm trying to reverse the damage that the constant fight or flight state has taken on my mental health.

Well tonight my mom returned from the a fast food joint with a caffeinated soda (one of my favorites too). I no longer saw it as an enjoyable beverage: I saw it as a substance that I was boderline ""allergic"" too (I know that caffeine intolerance isn't the same as an allergy, but that's the anology I use). Well I drank it. It honestly wasn't as good as I remember, I wasn't missing much. Soon after the familiar fight or flight state returned. It wasn't as intense as before, but it wasn't pleasent. My phobia of psychosis has been stronger tonight than normal as well, probably due to the fight or flight state. My neighbor started his motorcycle earlier and I nearly jumped off my couch.

I'm not saying that quitting caffeine is a miracle cure, and your results may not be this good. Hell, maybe my anxiety will return to its previous level anyway. But either way, I feel that I have an intolerance to anxiety or it is interfering with my medicine. If you haven't tried to quit caffeine before, I highly recommend it. Worst case scenario you go a few weeks without your favorite caffeinated beverage (and possibly (but hopefully not) caffeine withdrawels).

PS: Look out for hidden caffeine if you try this. Beverages with caffeine have caffeine content on the back under the nutrition label in the US (if in doubt, Google!). Also, chocolate can have A TON of caffeine. Some dark chocolate bars have as much caffeine as a soda. I'm not sure if there is a difference between how liquid and solid caffeine are metabolized, but I don't want to experiment with it personally."
2672,Anxiety,Dissociation :(,"What is your dissociation like? How does it make you feel?? 
Mine makes me feel light headed, dizzy and faint almost ? It’s hard to explain. But I feel spaced out and slow. But mostly it tricks me into thinking I’m going to faint. Just wondering if anyone else can relate."
2673,Anxiety,I’m scared I have a serious illness and I don’t know what to do?,"I’m an 18M, since 2019 when going back to school I experienced what I now know to be severe brain fog, this was in conjunction with a heavy feeling in the head/ pressure and constant lightheadedness. I was losing my mind as I didn’t  know what was happening to me. I believe this was my first experience of severe anxiety, it was fucking horrendous. I saw a doctor in October 2019, was a GP who did a neurological exam and did a blood test and was 80% sure it was anxiety. The blood test came back fine and he tested my balance, eyesight and blood pressure, all good. I had an eye test a month later with nothing found. The dizziness went away eventually but the brain fog was always there to some extent. 

Recently this has all flared up again, and has coincided with a recent upcoming job interview, I was ok with no dizziness from literally March till late August. Four days before my job interview I noticed the dizziness and my stomach dropped, the feeling was back. It’s now three days after the interview and I still have the same feeling and feel as though something is wrong with me. I’m scared as I don’t know when this will go and I’m still applying for jobs, I don’t know what to do, I’m scared and my brain fog is awful, sought out help but it didn’t cure this. I’ve lost my intelligence and memory and it upsets me. I’m frightened I have a brain tumour or something which can’t be cured. It scares the living shut out of me. 

No amount of mindfulness or exercise of healthy eating works, this is what terrifies me and no doctor will listen to an 18 year old with these problems, tour brushed off till shit gets serious. I need help and don’t know what to do."
2674,Anxiety,I cried,For the first time in a long time which I thought I couldn’t do anymore .
2675,Anxiety,How do I cure this anxiety?,I get anxious walking in public..pls help I cant live like this
2676,Anxiety,How do you deal with Sunday Evening anxiety?,"I am fortunate enough work a job where I get both weekends off. I also have general anxiety disorder and am on medication for the same.

And usually 75% of my weekends are good. I try to get some exercise done, usually cook something fancy for myself and family, sleep a fair bit, watch a movie, read a book upskill myself and basically do anything i feel like doing.

Then the clock hits 5pm on Sunday and I start spiralling. I feel one of the 100 different kinds of anxiety and sometimes multiple kinds in the same evening.


I feel like I am wasting away my life, I am not doing the things i should be doing, i am not performing well at work or sometimes the all consuming, inexplicable feeling that something is very wrong I just don't know what. A fair bit of this is anxiety about work. Sometimes I start the work I planned for Monday on Sunday evenings itself to make myself feel better. It doesn't help.

I don't know how many people feel this way, but if anyone has any advice/tips/articles or basically anything helpful to share about this, I'll be really grateful.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post!"

2679,Anxiety,Surgee of anxiety,I get these waves of anxiety where for 5-6 seconds i have intense anxiety then i take a deep breath and it calms down to normal . Immediately after i get intense anxiety again and the cycle restarts. Usually this can last between 10-30 minutes and happens every 2 weeks. This problem developed after trying thc oil for the first time. I am now convinced that it wasn't thc but some other nasty chemical which gave me brain damage and i am now going insane since it doesnt feel like a panic attack. Please help.

2682,Anxiety,Anxiety takes over reality.,"I actually hate myself for doing this now again.

In short. I'm afraid of not beeing able to sleep, because i had one sleepless night against my will.
For the last month everything went well.
I was able to accept and deal with my anxiety.
In time, i began to become my own master.

But yesterday.
The anxiety went straight up to eleven.
I have to say, that i did sleep in the end, but i seems to be irrelevant to the anxiety.
I'm trying to convince myself that everything is fine, i mean nothing bad happend. But it feels like, that i'm unable to look past the obstacle.
Those ""what if's"" are killing me. They are so real to me.

I know that it will be better. 
I know that it can be better.

BUT

The anxiety seems to real.
I can't imagine falling asleep, instead i'm imagining myself, turning in my bed unable to sleep.

I'm so fucking afraid."
2683,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxiety about getting older and aging??,I know there is nothing we can do about it but I still can’t wrap my head around it that we just grow old and die.
2684,Anxiety,When does the feeling from a panic attack go away,"I had my first serious panic attack yesterday, I managed to resolve the issue, but I still feel the same way as if nothing happened.

I still feel sick, I can't eat, when will things return to normal"
2685,Anxiety,Almost constant nausea,"I’m not sure if this is even the right community to post this in, but I’m pretty sure that my anxiety causes this. I used to have a very strong stomach with barely any gag reflex, never had a problem going to the dentist or brushing my tongue or bad smells or anything. Now even thinking about something gross makes me gag or even through up. I get nauseous almost every time I brush my teeth. I have such a weak stomach now. I don’t know if it stems from the anxious feeling that I constantly feel in my chest and stomach or if my adhd meds make it worse, but I just don’t know what to do. I can’t even eat food unless I’m craving or want that particular food, because even the thought of it makes me nauseous."
2686,Anxiety,"Please help me, I hate myself","Hi, I'm a 16 year old virgin guy, that keeps thinking about sex all the time, I spend a lot of time thinking about sex. Every time I sit down to study, i soon get interrupted by my thoughts. I have in fact even planned how I want to have sex with my girlfriend who is a also virgin already, in fact I have already ordered lube and condoms. I have realized how much time thinking about sex has taken up, and I really wanna change. I feel terrible, like a shitty person, a person that's a fucking pervert that doesn't deserve to be living. I really really need help, I can't afford therapy which is why I'm on here. Please help me please. I can give you more details if you need any but just help me"
2687,Anxiety,I think I may need daily medication. Any success stories out there?,"I've suffered from GAD, OCD and PTSD since childhood and I've mostly been able to manage without medication up until recently. I've started getting daily panic attacks out of the blue. I'm hyperaware of my heart and often feel like I'm suddenly going to have a heart attack and die. I've become more irritable and just a pain to be around. I'm losing sleep over it and I feel so defeated. I'm supposed to graduate uni in the next year but I'm scared of my anxiety getting in the way of that. 

I have benzos for the panic attacks but I don't want to rely on those too much. I heard some SSRI's are good for anxiety, but I'm scared of the potential side effects... especially the suicidal thoughts (I struggle with those quite a bit). Has anyone had success with daily medication? I'd appreciate reading your experiences, thanks! &lt;3"
2688,Anxiety,Anyone else feel guilty all the time?,"I feel guilty when I stand up for myself which sends me into a panic so I dont
I feel guilty when I want to say no to sex so I submit, well out of fear i’ll get hurt if I say no too
I feel guilty when I am so exhausted from work I lay in bed and do nothing to recover so my house is a mess
I feel guilty when I get mad when work adds more to my plate because i’m too afraid to say no

I feel guilty when I am not anxious because maybe i’m not really anxious but faking"
2689,Anxiety,Does anyone get sharpe pains randomly in the chest or get heart palpitations,So I get sharp pains occasionally in my chest or discomfort. For a while it was bad because I had chest pain allllll the time but went away and now it is back but I’ve been using cbd and I haven’t had anxiety so now I’m curious is it something more or just the usual?
2690,Anxiety,Uncomfortableness when stressed,"Whenever I have a lot of stress or anxiety my neck area becomes very uncomfortable, almost like I am constantly being tickled there. I have to adjust my shirt constantly near my neck because it keeps bothering me, and the strange part is that I still feel that sensation even when I take off my shirt. I usually don't feel this sensation but when it does occur it drives me crazy, and I was wondering if anyone else gets this and if there is anything I can do?"
2691,Anxiety,Anxiety is like a clear layer of skin.,"No one can see that it’s there, but they can see something is different about you – the way you move like you have practiced this a million times because you did; how you talk too fast (or too slow), too loud (or too low); when you stand in the aisle reading every label once, twice, three times only to be even more overwhelmed by this meaningless decision, except this decision is the difference between pride and regret. 

That moment, when someone (anyone) looks at you, is when that clear skin constricts; air from your lungs, rationality from your mind, and trust from your heart – you cannot trust yourself therefore, you cannot trust anyone. 

As quickly as peace had once filled you with a sense of control, anxiety will rip you apart."
2692,Anxiety,Secretly hoping my music gig gets rained out on Friday...,"My anxiety is at its highest in so long. My friends and family are all SO excited for my performance (outdoors, socially distant of course). Music has always been my passion and this’ll be my first gig in two years. 

But I’ve also been stressed due to being back in school. So I let myself procrastinate and hardly practiced. Hell, I just finally threw a setlist together today and it isn’t even long enough for my whole show time. 

I don’t want to do this gig. I’m not ready. I was too stressed to prioritize practicing, now I’m too anxious to even want to do the gig anymore. I don’t even feel excited or a genuine desire to do it anymore.

This sucks. I really hope it rains super hard. I don’t want to do this."
2693,Anxiety,I just had a minor anxious break from changing my desktop wallpaper and moving my taskbar from the bottom of the screen to the right,I promise i’m not joking or exaggerating. Dear fucking God why is my brain like this?
2694,Anxiety,im so incredibly tired of having an anxiety disorder,"seriously, why cant i just focus on the positive? its killing me"
2695,Anxiety,My Anxiety Treatment Journey,"Begins in March. School just closed because corona. My mental health was pretty good at school, but my lingering issues were still present. I decide to talk to my psychiatrist again because I’ll now have more time to focus on treatment &amp; also because being back home usually heightens my mental health problems.
So first I go on gabapentin. Pretty general light anxiety med. Not many side effects, not too crazy. On it for 2 months or so, ends up not helping much at all. As quarantine goes on my anxiety issues and other issues get a little worse. We switch from Gabapentin to Lexapro. I take one dose of Lexapro and have a manic episode, which I had actually had multiple of in my younger years without realizing they were manic episodes. Ah, shit. So i tell my psychiatrist about how a single dose of Lexapro caused me to be extravagantly confident and talkative and ridiculously giddy through the entire night and well into the morning. Turns out, I’ve had bipolar disorder this whole damn time. Fuck. So now I’m on lamictal, a bipolar medication that is not known to help anxiety, and have been for almost 2 months now.  It’s meant to help depressive episodes, which turns out I had been having this whole time, but once again, had been downplaying and ignoring. Whether or not it’s working, I honestly can’t tell yet. It’s been 5 months and Jesus fuck, this was originally about me having anxiety issues and now all this has gone down. Trust me, I’m really glad with how much progress I’ve made in figuring out what’s going on with my brain, but just, auuugh. I just wanted to deal with my anxiety!! 💀"
2696,Anxiety,Forgetting Things,"I have tried really hard to grasp my anxiety for years. I’ve struggled with it as long as I can remember but I’ve worked very hard to handle most social situations but this. 

My work hosts trainings multiple times a year to renew certifications and just has meetings in general. My supervisor will question everyone (anywhere from 4-6 people) kind of like popcorn style. Every single time I’m called on my mind goes blank, I forget everything I was thinking of and of course, start panicking to the verge of me almost tearing up. I normally just get red in the face, say “I don’t know” then start to talk very quietly and proceed with anxious tendencies like picking at my nails, tapping legs, avoiding eye contact, etc.

He knows and is very understanding and never mentions it but at the position I am at I shouldn’t be doing this and should be leading by example.  He has to ask me of course as he does everyone else and I noticed he gives me easier tasks to role play and do when it’s time to do so. 

The thing is, I know the answers to these and it’s embarrassing having this happen. I’ve had coworkers in the same position do the same to me and I literally cannot function properly when asked. I am at a loss with this and it’s so embarrassing and draining as I’m constantly on edge and mess up when performing actions or speaking. I feel like I need to constantly be on edge and I have this huge fucking lump in my throat the entire day I’m there doing these classes or meetings. 

Anyone else have this issue? I feel so defeated. I don’t get it."
2697,Anxiety,I’m terrified of COVID,"My anxiety has skyrocketed during the past 4 1/2 months of self-isolation. I’ve been SO careful with social distancing and other precautions. I only go out to go to the grocery store, and I don’t go anywhere where there’s a possibility that social distancing can’t be enforced. I wear a mask, face shield, and gloves when I go out. I’ve been in contact with 5 people outside of my home, and they all practice social distancing and 4/5 tested negative very recently before I was with them. The other person only spends time with the people who just tested negative. I also got tested last week and results came back negative a couple of days ago.

I have constant fear of spontaneously catching COVID, and even though I know logically that I’m being very safe and cautious, I can’t shake that worry. I guess I just want some reassurance that I’m okay. 

I will of course continue to practice strict social distancing even if I feel more assured that I’m at low risk for contracting it."
2698,Anxiety,What I hate about taking benzos,When I take my benzo my anxiety decreases. But then the wave of depression hits and my chest sinks
2699,Anxiety,Need some advice/maybe someone can relate,"Whenever there is big changes in my life (most recently my roommate moving out unexpectedly) Or big deadlines (me applying for certain university classes etc.) I feel just an overwhelming surge of the entire spectrum of emotions. Happy, sad, defiant, peaceful, stressed and panic. Ive thrown up twice today at my roommates sudden announcement (it wasn’t about me it was just about his financial situation) but it really just boggles my mind how something seemingly so small can just take over days or weeks. Can anyone relate?"
2700,Anxiety,"reality not real, fear of dying in sleep",Every night I go to bed it feels as if I won’t wake up and can’t imagine being up in the morning. It feels like things aren’t real or alreAdy happend and I have just been living through it.
2701,Anxiety,is this normal? looking at something for a few seconds especially at night and it just suddenly disappears?,"ive been having bad anxiety lately and this of course adds to it. is this normal, does this happen to everyone??"
2702,Anxiety,its getting kind of bad lol,"i have never had this bad of anxiety before. last year i was only really dealing with depression. i was in and out of treatment for mental health stuff. my general anxiety developed around 6 months ago. after that, my social anxiety developed. i wasnt sure why. i recently saw my psychiatrist after months (quarantine kind of stopped me from seeing her)...and she told me the facilities i went to may have caused underlying trauma. it still kind of confuses me. but anyways- now it's to the point where i can't go out in public without crying. i constantly fear that something bad is happening in my house. for example, whenever my mom lights a candle i have a panic attack because i think my house it going to catch on fire. im on xanax for it. but it's not helping. idk what to do. i feel like im constantly worrying and worrying. im scared of everything. i sometimes become delusional. which has lead to bad insomnia. ill usually convince myself that something is happening. one time i convinced myself that there were spiders crawling everywhere in my bad. again, idk what to do. this is just me venting...but if anyone sees this. do you have the same issue? should i seek help? idk."
2703,Anxiety,I really messed up,"I’m a serial procrastinator and this time it really buy me in the ass because I’m now realizing that I don’t necessarily have the resources (and time of course) to complete what I’ve been putting off, I should have just been honest and asked questions and asked for help but I didn’t and now I will most likely f a lot of things up. I don’t know what to do I can’t think normally I can’t sleep I haven’t panicked this much in so long it’s honestly making me suicidal, I really really messed I can’t do anything"
2704,Anxiety,I've showered every other day for a week!,"So the quarantine has me my anxiety screaming. I was showering about once a week for a while and last weekend I had the worst panic attack in the shower. I couldn't breathe, I was so dizzy, heart palpitations, whole 9. I ran out of the shower, lied down my bed and struggled for breath for like a half hour. 

This week, I decided that I'm not going to let my anxiety control me anymore. I've showered every other day this week. 3 showers in a row! I just got out and I feel so good!

Let's lock in this good feeling with some positive affirmation. Thanks in advance :)"
2705,Anxiety,guilt,"i’m not sure if this fits here, but does anyone else feel really guilty when they go out? it’s not like i’m doing anything wrong, i’m just hanging out with my friends. i get in these moods where i feel so guilty for going out and just hanging out with my friends. it’s like i need approval that it’s okay if i go out."
2706,Anxiety,I am pushing my loved one away,"I have a therapist. I have a psychologist. I do not take any medicine for anxiety. 


“Breathe, meditate, go for a walk...” can only do so much.


I have been nothing but anxious. I’ll have my good days, but then I go back to overthinking and catastrophizing. 

 My boyfriend has had it. He has tried to understand but I keep coming back to ask for reassurance, more times than I’d like. I just can’t help it, I was doing so good at trying to keep my distance and talk myself out of calling and texting him multiple times. But I failed. More than a few times. I just want his love, I want to know he loves me. He tells me he does, but I can’t help but think “does he really?”. I fucking hate myself for thinking this way. He says he would never cheat on me but I can’t help but wonder lately with me acting all crazy. 

He says that this is pushing him away.

It makes me so, so sad. I’m doing this to myself. Why can’t I just fucking stop???

I haven’t ate for two days now. I can’t, I constantly feel like I have to puke. Sleep hasn’t been well either. I’m crying at work. I’m crying at home.

I see him tomorrow in person, and I’m fearing the worst. I think he will break up with me. I do not want to lose him. 


How can I help myself?"
2707,Anxiety,I hate when people have high expectations for me.,I get so anxious when people praise me for something because I feel so pressured to live up to their expectations in the future. Instead of feeling proud of myself or accomplished when I get praised.. I just think “oh fuck” Now I can’t ever make a mistake. It’s miserable at work because I just know I’m going to fuck it up one day. I guess this could be my imposters syndrome.
2708,Anxiety,A little Caffeine “Reduces Anxiety” or is it just placebo?,"I have anxiety issues. I should be avoiding caffeine. However after drinking a cup of coffee or tea I feel less anxious. I feel more confident, talkative and overall very positive. Yet too much caffeine and I’m nervous. I read an article online that agreed with this, but the vast majority of experts say, if you have anxiety issue avoid Caffeine. Is caffeine helping my anxiety or is it just placebo effect?

Do have similar experiences with caffeine?"

2710,Anxiety,Insomniac Games (An Anxiety Poem),"
It’s near two in the quiet morning,
And I’ve hardly slept a wink.
This darn anxiety is keeping me up,
So much chaos in my head I just can’t think. 

I’m trying to do some basic rhyming,
To see if that will help knock me out,
But now I’m just thinking in synonyms,
And oh how it’s making me want to shout.

Erica is doing just fine and dandy,
Snoring away next to me on the bed,
I think Leah must have just farted,
But maybe that sound was just in my head.

During the day these pills help calm me,
But at night they bring hallucinations.
Dark moving figures in the corner of the room,
You’ve gone crazy Mark, congratulations.

“Just close your eyes, or go run a few miles”
Is what they always tell me I should do. 
It’s not that simple, it just doesn’t work,
People mean well but they just haven’t got a clue.

Well if I’m crazy I might as well embrace it,
So I’ll beckon over the dark figure by the door.
I got a deck of uno cards to pass the time,
Here you go scary devil man, draw four."

I start panicking  hour or half before any meeting in which I just have to sit listen. The other day someone asked me to introduce me and I went blank and was hesitating and my heartbeat increased significantly. I started to avoid questions which was very apparent. I feel a weird sensation in my left arm like an electric current, that goes to my heart. I have a good answer in my mind but I cannot express it. It has been quite some time since the last meeting but I still cannot feel relaxed.
I am starting feel if I can continue this job or not, because at some point of time I have to take some serious responsibility.

2727,Anxiety,Having anxiety is a full time job you don't get paid for,"Well, maybe that's not how it is for everyone, but I am always in my head. Thinking, Planning, problem solving, and of course, worrying. Then worrying some more. I'm never in the current moment, my mind is always in the future. Before I know it, the day is over, and I have barely acknowledged/talked to anybody and barely looked anyone in the eye.

I'm not miserable, I just need to get out of of my head, stop worrying with my mind jumping from one thing to the next, stop getting frustrated and irritated, stop overthinking everything, and instead actually live life and enjoy it."

2731,Anxiety,"Overwhelming sense of doom, please help","I only installed reddit a couple of weeks ago, and I never wrote a post so I hope I'm going in the right direction here. I'm sorry that this is long, but I never vented before about this, please help. 
I'm 18, female, I think I have been dealing with some anxiety for a couple of years now, I have been to scared to see a therapist but my mental state has been so bad that I think I need to go.
There has not been one day that I can remember that I didn't feel anxious for the past couple of years,  overthinking about everything I say and do, I act really clumsy because of worrying about my movements so much. I don't know how to talk well with people and all of my answers are repetitive and generic, because I am afraid of expressing my thoughts to people. If I know someone for a long time, I especially can't say a phrase or talk about something new because I'm scared of them noticing, if that makes sense. I hate getting compliments or getting noticed by people in any negative or positive way. I've been bad with my parents because I can't express my opinions on anything towards them, because I've started getting closed off ever since I was 12 till the point where I just act very cold and as if I have no personality, so at this point i'm scared of showinh them i have my own opinions. Anyway, it started getting way worse not too long ago, when I was about to break up with my boyfriend of 2 and a half years with whom I spent every single day wtih for those past years, and still do. The thing is, I solely hang out with him and every single friend apart from 2 I have was originally his friend and if we were to break up I would be left completely alone. The reason for almost breaking up was this theme that is brought up every so often, the fact that the first day of the relationship, my ex pinned me to a wall and didn't let me go till I kissed him, and my boyfriend blames me for that for being alone with him for a couple of minutes. With that, I have been sexually assultet by this ex while we were together, and he doesn't believe me because I stayed with him afterwards because I am way too forgiving. With that, he wants to have either a threesome or sex with another girl, because he says that would make us even. ( he was a virgin prior to me and I wasn't, and that's anither reason why he wants that) I'm not into the idea of any of that, I hate it. Because he was insecure, he made me insecure about my body because he likes really petite flat girls and for months he had been telling me about flat chests and porn stars to the point where I can't look at any girls in movies with him, and definitely can't watch porn, I get offended at memes that have anything to do with sex, virgins, and chest sizes, etc etc. But other than this, I am really attached to him and he treats me great, I do love him. I feel really bad about myself though. We were supposed to break up a month ago and i felt this awful feeling as if i were in a room with no doors and windows, just trapped. I felt empty, and as if the world was ending. My lips and fingers  were numbing and turning white. Even though we stayed together, there has not been one day where I haven't felt this feeling. Every day, 24/7, i feel this awful doom feeling, I can't focus on anything, I lost 7kg this month and i can cry so easily it's not normal. I don't know what to do, I can't solve these problems with my boyfriend, literally we can't find any way to do so. I am constantly hoping he doesn't leave me, constantly terrified of saying something that's gonna make him mad (since he gets mad at me a lot ever since then) and I am so scared of being alone because I have started having suicidal thoughts. I have been having those thoughts because this doom feeling is so intense I literally can't see a reason to live if I can't shake it off. Anything I do, see, whatever, I feel this feeling. With all of that, I have introduced him to my friend (f) and he got mad at me for talking with another friend about medicinal stuff for too long and that irritates him because he doesn't wanna hear about it. He proceeded talking to my female friend for hours and hours, not acknowledging my existance. I felt so sad.  I really think he likes her because our personalities are similar but she's very confident, much prettier, petite with a small chest and can talk about anything. However, I did tell that friend about this and she is trying to help me, but I can't feel any better. I know I'm portraying my boyfriend as toxic but really, he is amazing apart from these things I stated. I don't know what to do, I'm trying to branch out to hang out with more people if possible, and I am just waiting for college to start so I have my mind off of this. I am afraid that if i start making friends and take up some activities and such, that I will ruin the relationship because I would be distancing myself from him. I don't know if it's better to be with him all the time, because he can say mean things to me and get mad, and I can't get mad back because it's gonna start a fight, and i'm constantly stressed because I need to seem as if I'm normal and calm all the time, and I need to not react when he tells me i'm annoying, dumb, can't do anything right etc etc. Again, it can be amazing with him but he just saw so many of my flaws that that's the only thing he sees in me rn. I feel dumb for this being the reason why I'm so stressed, since so many bad things happened in my life and this is the thing that makes me feel awful all the time. I feel guilty about this being the reason I feel awful. Is there a way out of this mindset? I wanna stay with him, but I can't act like a normal person, and i feel so embarrassed about anything I do, literally anything. I got kinda drunk and was the only one who was out of this friend group and even though I didn't say anything wrong or do anything stupid, I felt and still feel like such an idiot for doing that, I was probably loud and just laughed at everything and I hate it. I hate that they told me I smell like alcohol abd I hope i never see those people again because I am so embarassed. What do i do? If anyone sees this, thank you, since I don't know if I'm doing this reddit thing right."
2732,Anxiety,Weird one: medicated panic attacks?,"GAD and depression here. I'm on Effexor and a beta blocker for panic attacks but I'm still having them physically but not mentally? So my skin breaks out, my scalp is awful, I'm sweating and pins and needles in hands but no racing heart and no despair. Can your body still react even if your brain is calmer? It's weird. Like a possession :O"
2733,Anxiety,I'm breaking my own heart,"I'll do something I enjoy, or meet someone I like. Once I'm home, I'll think about every little thing I did, examine their behaviour and come up with scenarios in which they dislike me. I'll also come up with nice scenarios, but those make me feel sad because I don't think they will ever happen. 

I'm breaking my own heart by thinking."
2734,Anxiety,What's your favorite audiobook that helped you cope with your anxiety?,"What audiobook helped you the most? I use audible if that makes a difference. 

I've had SEVERE anxiety all my life but only in the last few years have I genuinely tried to combat it and feel better. Meds don't help me that much, I've been on so so many to find only a small reduction in my overall anxiety. 1mg lorazepam will knock my 6'5"" 200lb bf out like a light in the middle of nearly any anxiety attack and it takes a minimum of 2mg to rip me from the middle of an anxious episode, 1mg is ok for small anxieties. It's so frustrating that either my body isn't as receptive to medication or that my anxiety is just that high at all times. My therapist who I've been seeing for a year retired a month and a half ago and unfortunately I am going through a LOT right now, and could really use something to help me. Though life is crazy as can be rn, my anxiety isn't new and hasn't changed. It's the same anxiety (about literally everything all the time) and I've had ENOUGH. Radical acceptance is something I severely struggle with because my anxiety/mental illnesses are what I hate about myself the most aside from my weight, which seems to be something I need to accept bc it just keeps piling on with any meds I get put on. I'm overwhelmingly terrified of other people and their potentially negative thoughts about me. Going to the store was terrifying to me before covid and now it's absolutely unbearable unless I go in the middle of the night. Everything is just so damn scary! Even when I know it's not. Nervous system hyper-sensitization allllll the way lol. 

I like learning about what's physically happening to me when experiencing anxiety, it helps me feel more normal, idk. Oddly enough, I was a psychology major but dropped out as a sophomore after having a nervous breakdown over failing I/O psych and because I was convinced (by others) that I could never be a good psychologist because I was just too crazy (as I was labeled by others, so that was my belief for the longest time). Anyway, I have a deep passion for psychology and neuroscience and like learning about myself and my anxiety through this lens, from a psychologist's standpoint. 

I like podcasts but find more information from actual scientific studies in audiobooks and less anecdotal information like I hear from podcasts. Not to dig on anecdotal evidence, it's important to understand how other people dealing with the same affliction feel and deal with it, cold hard facts just hit my brain differently in a way that really sinks in. I suppose I'm open to podcast suggestions as well. 

Thanks so much :)"
2735,Anxiety,I feel anxious about my friend most days,"I live with three of my friends - one who is constantly either anxious, overwhelmed, depressed, angry...etc. Before we moved in together, she wasn’t this bad but over the last three years, she has gone from crisis to crisis. I’m planning on not living with her when our rental contract ends so I know I have that to look forward to but for now I just feel constantly anxious around her. I feel guilty and anxious worrying about her when I come home such as will she be home, and what kind of mood will she be in. And even when I try to introvert in my room and not be around her i feel guilty that I’m not being a good friend and being there for her, or I feel anxious not knowing what’s happening.

I know I need to have a healthy balance/boundaries, but I’m really struggling. Any tips on managing my own anxiety around the situation?"
2736,Anxiety,How did you overcome your fear of judgment?,"No matter what I do, I always feel like someone is judging me. When I receive compliments for some work I did, I always think people are making fun of me and they don't mean that. If I text someone, I overthink about being a bother or look stupid. When I make new friends and have to introduce myself, I just keep thinking they're going to talk bad about me behind my back. 
Even while I'm typing this, I'm so scared someone will think this is such a dumb thing to ask.
Lately, I won a small writing competition - but I couldn't be happy. I'm sure there's someone who deserves that little prize more than me. What if they are talking bad about me behind my back? 

I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes - I'm not a native English speaker. Plus, I've never written anything on Reddit before. I hope I respected every rule of the community. 
Thank you so much for listening."
2737,Anxiety,"Bad gut feeling thinking of ex, but only at work","I recently got a new temporary job, which has been good for the most part.
The thing is, I do orderpicking in a warehouse, which means I am alone with my thoughts most of the time.

For some reason I am constantly thinking about my ex, and have this bad gut feeling. Before I had a job and when I am not working I'm not worried over my ex whatsoever. I feel very happy with my current girlfriend!


Perhaps an important detail is that my current girlfriend lives across the world, and we haven't physically met in 5 months.


I wish I understood my emotions, ugh."
2738,Anxiety,Almost started working out,"For months on end have been making excuses to not sign up to a gym.

Finally signed up and for the last few weeks I have driven over straight from work late at night, only to sit in my car for 30+ minutes freaking out and end up driving all the way home. 

Last night I ventured over, only to head back home after I couldn’t figure out how to open the after hours access. Left feeling humiliated.

Tonight, I made my way over after work, sat in my car for ages syking myself out. I watched someone else open the door so got out and copied them. Walked inside and within minutes I crumbled, couldn’t start a piece of equipment so ran out.

I could not stop crying all the way home, feeling useless. But I made it inside finally, so it’s only up from here."
2739,Anxiety,Blushing at later age?,"I'm 30 years old and I've not had this problem before, or not as bad. I've always been very shy and anxious person and social situations are the worst, but now seems I've developed blushing too and I hate it!

How common it is to start blushing at later age? I feel like most have it since youth."
2740,Anxiety,I feel so sick,"every moment I have doubt, it gives me a gut wrenching twist in my stomach. I’ve had three anxiety attacks this week. how do I make it go away? how do I stop crying?

I want security but I freak myself out to the point where I almost puke from hyperventilating or I cry endlessly."
2741,Anxiety,I almost became a mass murderer due to undiagnosed Body Dysmorphic Disorder," 

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I've recently self-diagnosed myself with BDD, and I feel like it answers so many questions that I've always had about myself, and explains so many of my issues.

The title of my post is dramatic, but I thought that there must be someone out there who this may help, as well as that I need to get it off my chest. This is how BDD wrecked havoc on my personal development in life.

Going to try to keep this pretty concise.

I'm in my early thirties, and for the past decade, almost, I've been trying to figure out what's wrong with me and get my life back on track.

I first started showing signs of BDD when I was around 8. I hated my face so much that I didn't want to leave my room or be seen by anyone. My parents did their best to help me, but I was convinced I was hideous. From then on, BDD related intrusive thoughts were a constant.

As I got older and entered puberty, I was already suffering from social anxiety, and a strong sense of being ""different"". I felt subhuman. I was very conscious of my appearance, and absolutely hated how I looked, but BDD also plagued my subconsciousness; it affected how I acted around and towards other people. I didn't develope the same social skills as people around me, especially with regards to the opposite sex; when a few people started dating in the 6th grade, I actually had a girl I was into, and who was into me, but I completely lacked the sense in my head to do anything about it, and she started ""dating"" another guy.

This pattern of avoidance continued through my teens, as I would see people dating and being social, and I felt like an outcast. What makes it extra painful is that I actually turned girls down, because I wanted to avoid .. being with them. It was a very difficult and confusing time for me. I felt more and more like an outcast, and at this point, my group of friends was also going down.

From the 3rd grade, I never really did homework. I can't explain what the reason was, because I come from a really great and loving family, I went to good schools and had motivated peers, but I never did homework. Again, this feeling of being different from everyone else.. I now believe that my BDD was so bad that I legitimately started thinking I actually WAS different, and that I was a monster.

I started browsing sites like 4chan, and other various slum websites, from the porn variation to the gore variation. I became fascinated by serial killers and mass murderers, like school shooters. I felt it resonated with me... I was a monster, and the idea of unleashing all the pain and confusion that had plagued my mind, onto everyone around me, was appealing. Everyday after school, when I wasn't mindlessly gaming for hours on end, I would view this filth and poison my mind further. I would harass people online, and towards the end of my teens, I was becoming a toxic person in real life too, especially towards my family.

I dreamed of suicide. I dreamed of shooting up my highschool, or doing the same downtown. All the while, I maintained a dwindling social life with a core group of friends, where I would lament my loner status, having no chance with girls, and just.. being different.

I realize my post is now very long, so I'm going to leave it at that. But, hopefully, I have shared some insight into how a mental disorder like BDD can spiral out or control, and if left unchecked, under the proper circumstances; destroy your soul.

One last thing that I want to add, after now being sure that I've properly diagnosed myself; I can't begin to describe the amount of sadness, remorse, and regret I have for having thrown so much of my life away, and the other people it affected. I'm sad that I wasn't diagnosed, and I'm sad that I became how I became. So many people I could have known, girlfriends I could have had, things I could have done and experienced.. and above all, how different my outlook on myself and my life could have been."
2742,Anxiety,Movies TV shows to get through first two week of starting anti depressants,"Hey! I’ve (for the second time) started on ecitalopram after experiencing a second acute episode of anxiety! 

I’m also experiencing quite a few sides effects on top of my anxiety which is very physical - nausea, shaking, no appetite, vomiting, tight chest etc Etc and am feeling quite down! 

To help get me through the next few weeks, I would appreciate any suggestions for funny / light hearted movies or TV shows? Or maybe even some low key activities?

Or what helped you get through it? 

Thanks kindly, Mel"
2743,Anxiety,Can’t sleep,"Hey guys! So normally sleep isn’t a problem for me. Even though I have anxiety and stuff during the day, by the time I go to sleep, my body is so tired that I could get myself to sleep. But today, I had a major panic attack few hours ago and I was able to calm myself to be able to go to sleep. But the thing is that I woke up a hour later. And since then, I can’t go back to sleep because I feel the stress in my brain and i feel jerky when I almost fall down to sleep. Is this normal? What is happening? Is this going to last forever? I need to sleep because I have work and my anxiety gets really bad when I don’t sleep enough. Please help"
2744,Anxiety,2 Different crisis hotlines hung up on me because I was incoherent at my worst moment and because they took personal offense to my situation.,"Not incoherent the entire time, Just when absolutely breaking down and unable to control anything from my body, crying manically, to my brain running a million miles an hour.
  
First one, national suicide hotline, 15 minutes on hold waiting. I spiral and breakdown. trying to hold anything together and explain my situation, 3 minutes into the call I heard the operator say ""Can't understand you dude"" and then they hang up not 10 seconds later. 
  
Second I called my local health network crisis line. This company also who handles my therapy and medications for the past 5 years. When asked to explain my therapy history to the ""crisis specialist"", they took personal offence to me saying ""You guys"" ONE TIME as a reference to the company + it's employees as people who have not helped me. (*news flash* if i'm giving you my history you have not helped me yet.) After interrupting me multiple times as I'm trying to explain the meaning of ""You"" to someone who finally just rants at me for nearly a minute about how 'I've never dealt with them specifically before' and how to 'not make it personal' I hung up before I exploded on their ignorance and woke up my roommates. 
   
The only person willing to treat me like a human being was the one who answered after calling to report the 2nd incident. By this time I am pure vindictive rage and calming down because I'm going to get my revenge for abusing me at my most vulnerable moment. 
  
If I've learned one thing from my experience with Hotlines in the past 5+ years, its don't call them. Call a loved one or friend who regards you as a living, thinking human being. These hotline and their 'specialist' are just there for a paycheck and will make you suffer for their own easement, the same as any other job."
2745,Anxiety,I have become anxious around my girlfriend and I am not sure why,"Hi everyone,

I have been dating my girlfriend for almost two years and it has been absolute bliss. She is kind, caring, compassionate, empathetic, my best friend, and as corny as it sounds I do believe she is my soulmate. I had no issues at all with our relationship, and I still don’t, but for about the past week I have been anxious when around her and I’m not sure why. I have general anxiety disorder so anxiety is nothing new to me, but what is new is when I’m around her I get anxious, or even when I’m thinking about her I get anxious. 

I have been trying to figure out what can be the cause of the anxiety, but I cannot pin point it. I think it may be because I do not want to hurt her in any way, but I’m not sure why I think that because I do not want to break up with her and will not break up with her. 

Has anyone been in a situation like this with their partner before? If so, what did you do to fix the situation and what was the outcome? Thank you for the help."
2746,Anxiety,Job interview today,I'm going to an interview in person today. Lately they have mainly been over the phone. My stomach is already acting up. I feel like I'm gonna not gonna know what to say or I'm gonna sound dumb. I've been going over possible questions and answers in my head but I'm still worried they will throw in something I didn't think of. This would be a great job for me and I really need it too. Any reasurring words or words of advice?
2747,Anxiety,Thought I should share my story...,"Alright, context first... I have been doing an Internship which was mandatory by my college. In the internship, we had to prepare a Case Study, Literature Review, and then give a viva. The first 2 were done, and today was our online viva. We used Microsoft Teams for that. We were given to prepare a Powerpoint Presentation, share our desktop, and present it. In the Presentation Slides, we had to write an overview of the Case Study and the Literature Review that we had written. Preparing the Presentation Slides wasn't a big deal for me, as I've also done that a few times, before. 

Now, my turn came for the viva. I shared my Powerpoint Presentation on the Microsoft Teams. And then the sir, who was taking our viva, said, ""Alright, now present it."" And that's when it happened. I couldn't speak a word. I didn't know what to say. I sat there in silence. I struggled to utter some words, and finally what came out was, ""So, um... uh... this is my presentation..."" And after a few intervals of silence, I repeated the sentence again. Then sir asked me some questions, and thankfully, they were very simple, so I was able to answer them, except the last one, ""So what is your conclusion?""

*What do you mean conclusion? What do I say? You mean the conclusion of the Case Study, or this Presentation? I can't remember the conclusion I wrote in the Case Study. How do I open my Case Study folder, my computer is lagging too much, right now. I don't have time. What do I do? What do I say?*

I repeatedly hit my hands on my thighs, telling myself to speak at least *something*, but nothing came out except, ""Um..."" and ""Uh...."" 

Then at last the sir said, ""Alright, I get it. You have trouble presenting the slide, right?"" 

""Yeah um... Right.""

""Fine then. Now, I will be taking the viva of the next participant, and removing you from the meeting.""

That was one hell of an anxiety rollercoaster for me. God knows if I'll pass the Internship or not. I sometimes ask myself, why am I like this. But then eventually get over it, and move on."
2748,Anxiety,Anxiety makes me react badly to ‘feedback’ - any tips to handle this?,"Every time I get feedback I react badly to it (internally) my heart races, my face goes red, I become panicky and start tearing up. The only way I can handle this is to just ‘shut down’ and wait for it to be over! 

Anyone else have this?"
2749,Anxiety,Anyone else have a fear of death so extreme it's controlling their life?,"Last year in August I had a really bad existential panic attack because it hit me I'd die one day, and it's almost like it's left me permanently depressed. 

Every thought I have is accompanied by ""don't bother doing that you'll just die and won't even remember"". I remember on my birthday shortly after I was on my way to get a piercing and I was so excited and then the thought crept in and my day was ruined and I felt like I'd been hit in the stomach. I wouldn't say the feelings lessened since August but I've definitely gotten use to it, it's like a droning noise in the background of my mind that occasionally flares up in random spikes of utter panic that leave me feeling completely broken. I just can't get over the fact that one day I'll die and it'll be like I never was, I won't even remember typing out this very post and this knowledge makes me feel like I'm Not even real.

I've found that I tend to use this as some sort of messed up coping mechanism, if i start panicing I tell myself nothing is real and neither am I so it doesn't matter, but it hasn't helped in the long run because I've started adapting it to other situations. Say I've upset a person and I feel bad, well I'll also have the thought ""they're basically not real and they'll die one day and forget it so it doesn't matter""

I don't know what to do anymore, it's like it's a massive part of my daily life now, I sleep in late and stay up as late as I can every night so that when I do finally sleep im so tired that I don't have a chance to lay there and wallow in thoughts that end up turning into panic attacks, and that in turn has screwed up my school life because I'm missing at least half of every week because I feel too tired and depressed to even get up

Just to clarify too, being told ""that's what makes life so precious, you should appreciate it while you can!"" Does not help me in any way, in fact it makes me feel worse because I'm being reminded that it will end (""while you can""), everyone I've told seems to use this same line and I've had people get all huffy because I won't accept what they've said in a ""thanks I'm cured"" way."
2750,Anxiety,How do I stop being rude because of my anxiety?,"So I’m 17 and just got my first job in a fast food place. My job is to take orders (in person and both on the phone). I have really bad anxiety so this was out of my comfort zone and also I’m extremely awkward. My boss and my friend there told me that I’m being rude to the customers and to be “more polite” which made me even more nervous than I was. Yesterday I was with my boyfriend and asked him to pretend he’s a customer and tell me if I act rude and he said that I do a little bit and I really don’t know how to fix it or how I should act, help?"
2751,Anxiety,My anxiety feels 'meta' and I have no clue what to do about it,"\*I've never actually posted on Reddit before so apologies if this is formatted wrong or whatever\*

So I'm 19 and am starting University in just over a month and I cannot begin to describe the meltdown I'm currently facing. I've struggled with crippling anxiety for years now and it's held me back in so many areas in life. Things such as being able to hold a job and constantly flaking on friends when I have any plans just to avoid that feeling of needing to throw up and not knowing where I could get away with doing so. I've spent the last year on a 'gap year' AKA locking myself in my room for a year as it's the only place I feel comfortable. I've tried antidepressants like Sertraline which gave me nothing but side effects for a year and also bought into the CBD oil hype in hopes the praise it was getting would hold up for me but again nope my anxiety is apparently on some god mode shit and is not effected by any kind of substance. 

Now, the reason I feel my anxiety is 'meta' (which probably sounds stupid I know) is because I can never explain what I'm anxious about when I'm going into a social situation. Eating in public for example, most people with this anxiety explain it as feeling embarrassed that people are judging them but this is where I differ from most people with anxiety I feel. While I do struggle with eating in public at times it's not because I feel like people are judging me I couldn't care less about that because I understand that eating is normal but my body doesn't agree and decides it's time for me to throw up and shit myself at the same time. Is it possible that I'm anxious about getting anxious? 

At this point it genuinely feels like there's no hope for me like there is for other people as my situation sounds so dumb. There seems to be no root of my issue it's literally just my body trying to kill itself anytime I'm in a situation that is like semi new to me so how can this actually be fixed?

2754,Anxiety,Scared of losing my senior year to coronavirus 2021,"I'm a rising senior in college. My school just announced that we are doing the fall semester online. At first they seemed committed for us to return with restrictions and masks etc. But seemingly out of nowhere they decided to scrap the whole plan.

I miss my friends and my team. I didn't even get to say goodbye to them last semester. My best friend was class of 2020 and I never got to say goodbye to him in person or see him graduate. I'm scared that I'll never see any of them again after college. I love my family but we push eachother's buttons sometimes. I worried that if they can't get this stupid virus under control in 6 months what difference will 4 more months do. Online classes send my anxiety through the roof and I can't focus. I want to graduate with my friend group and team I don't want to do it online. I don't know if the spring will be the same but the uncertainty is killing me."

2757,Anxiety,I am so scared right now,"My husband is getting surgery today and someone was supposed to drive him since he is going to be groggy once he gets out. Well... no one was able to come with him so guess who did have to... yep you guessed it me, his surgery is out in the city which means I’ll be driving on the freeway going super fast and I am not looking forward to it at all. I get super anxious behind the wheel and overthink everything. Any tips on how to calm down or how to get over this at least for today?"
2758,Anxiety,"Feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, literally.","Recently I’ve been feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, but literally. I can’t stop moving and stretching or cracking my bones, all of it. My heart feels like it’s fluttering and my legs feel like they won’t ever stop moving. 
I’m overweight and sometimes I know this has part of the reason to do with it. I just wonder, how much better would I feel if I didn’t have this little gut when I sat down? 
This info isn’t needed but whatever. I was diagnosed with GHSV-1 in February and I’m currently going through my 2nd outbreak, and it fucking sucks. I’m extremely uncomfortable, woke up 5 times last night because of it. (For those who don’t know anything about herpes though, it’s not as bad as everyone makes it out to be, the stigma is the worst part)
It’s just all of it combined has me feeling like I want to die again. Being uncomfortable in your own skin is probably one of the worst feelings I’ve ever experienced, I don’t wish it on anyone."
2759,Anxiety,"I had an anxiety attack at work yesterday, scared to go today","I'm an 18 year old trans male, my entire life I've struggled with social anxiety and depression, I struggle to be around many people and texting is the easiest way for me to get my feelings out.

I work with a disability center for now until i can get an actual job, i garden and other stuff get paid alright but yesterday I flipped out and I think I had an anxiety attack or panic attack I'm not so sure.

They brought out the lawn chipper or something I couldn't see it and the noise made everything blurry and dizzy and I almost passed out my heart was racing so fast and I could barely breathe through the mask I use every day. 

I was digging at my ears and eventually came to but still shocked, I didn't talk for over an hour and I am still shaken over it. I slept until 4 am once I got home at 3 PM. I have a sickening feeling in my stomach as time ticks by and I have to go to work soon, they've never seen me like that before. I usually have  my headphones in but didn't have them that day because they were dead. 

Usually when I'm kinda anxious my hearing seems to make music seem like it's slower and stuff and my stomach aches terribly and that's how I'm feeling right now, I'm shaking slightly and holding my cat but I still feel terrible.

I have extremely good hearing due to my eye sight being so bad and I also have a form of autism called aspurgers or something and Misophonia probably other things too but I don't remember or really know. 

I also have trouble talking to people I don't know or large severs, have terrible self esteem to where my mother thought i had paranoia maybe i do I don't know and I brought this long enough I just need some advice on how to calm down and forget about this. I didn't tell anyone because they'll probably think I'm crazy or lying or something"

It was winter, I weighed 215 lb. Im back home again and going to Starbucks later to try a tall guava passion fruit. I am not anxious or confident, just normal. It is summer and I weigh 175 lb. I learned that SOME of my anxiety is directly proportional to how I'm looking. I still don't look awesome, I have 30 lb to lose, but I feel more comfortable in my own skin. That's so important. Also, exercise helps w esteem"

I am tense pretty much all the time from my anxiety (most of the time it's at work or things similar) and this has led to very tense muscles in my shoulders and tension headaches when its really bad.

I felt more scared than I ever have. My anxiety started flaring up really bad. I couldn’t breathe, my heart was racing, I felt like throwing up, and I could not stop shaking. After I texted him some and called a few times he finally answered and he had just fallen asleep. I think I’m crazy for that now that I think about it. I think I’m crazy for freaking out and over reacting and calling him so many times. Do I sound crazy or is this just a normal anxiety thing?"

Last night I woke up in the middle of the night, had a panic attack, dry heaved, then calmed down. Then another panic attack, more dry heaving, and then I calmed down. Then another one, and I actually threw up. I’ve dry heaved from anxiety before but never threw up.

2772,Anxiety,Experiences with depersonalization,"This is something I never really talked about before but when I was 16, I experienced depersonalization for two days. It was the first time for me. 

I remember being on holiday in my mother's hometown, I was watching myself from above. I walked into a cafe and ordered, but the view as if I was staring from a distance and above myself. When I sat down with my drink, I barely even remembered the interactions. 

I walked back to the hotel and I remembered seeing people bump into me but not feeling it. It was a crowded city so it's not unusual for people to bump into you but usually I try to avoid it. I remember thinking while watching myself 'Weird how I'm so okay with people bumping into me..' 

My mom was with an old friend who was a doctor so when she saw me curled up in bed, she asked what's wrong. I said I felt dizzy and bad and just wanted to sleep. Her friend wondered if I had anaemia (actually later found out I did have bad iron deficiency). 

Had this sensation of watching myself from afar for about two days before it went back to normal. It was horrible. I didn't understand it. 

A couple years later it happened again but just for one night. I was in a market on holiday again with a friend when I felt it. I said I was feeling sick and dizzy so she took me back to the hotel and I lay in bed trying to make it stop. I felt so bad for making her sit there waiting for me to feel better. 

I only found out I had anxiety about two years ago. It made soooooo much sense. I didn't really know anything about it but when the doctor explained, I had so many 'OHHHHH' moments. This depersonalization thing especially. I seriously thought it was a symptom of anaemia. Now I am in meds and it's been pretty awesome. Haven't had that horrible depersonalization for a long time. 

I just wanted to write this out because I never talked about it. I think it's such a crazy phenomenon. Anyone else had such experiences?"
2773,Anxiety,Anxiety with BP spikes and diarrhea,"Please, please help. I have been taking my bp at home but sometimes when I am anxious or if I have to go to the doctors office my bp is ridiculous. At home it's usually in normal range occasionally a tad higher but not bad. But when I go to the docs it can spike to 170/100 which really scares me. Does anyone have experience with this?? I am now obsessed with my blood pressure. It controls my life. It's a very annoying compulsion. I want to avoid meds but of course the doc wants me on them. This issue got worse after I had bp issues after pregnancy and now has resurfaced after quarantine. Can anyone help??? 

Also I have diarrhea every morning which I assume is IBS. I've only had this for a couple months but every time I have to poop or am gassy I feel very anxious. Gawd 😭"

2779,Anxiety,I can't get a job because of anxiety,"Anxiety and depression ruined my life. When my depression is bad, it tells me that **TW** &gt;!suicide is the only way. !&lt; I hate having these thoughts but it doesn't change the fact that they make perfect sense to me and I'm scared that that won't happen because I'd be helpless

That means I have to get a job, which I've always been anxious about, my brain goes blank when I think about it but at the same time I feel like I'm overwhelmed with too many thoughts. The way employers treat their employees scares me. I'm not anxious seeing them, I'm anxious because I know what they say would trigger my depression and I wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

From job application to interview to work and to stay there...it seems like an impossible task for me. This somehow reinforces my suicidal thoughts because I can't live without working."
2780,Anxiety,hospital visit,"as i write this i am again on my way to the hospital cause i fear something is wrong with my heart. last times i went i was told i was 100% fine but my panic attacks are getting so severe i genuinely feel like i’m dying when it happens. i don’t know what to do cause a part of me is so convinced i have something wrong for months now and i’ve stayed up till sunrise every night in fear to go to sleep, i always checks my pulse in fear there’s something wrong. i need to know i’m not alone. its so scary"
2781,Anxiety,I HATE when people make me feel invalidated.,"My mom is always so quick to brush my anxiety off and it’s making me f*cking angry anymore. I have been DIAGNOSED by MULTIPLE THERAPISTS and DOCTORS with GAD, panic disorder and PTSD and she STILL tries to act like it’s not real.

My blood pressure is really high and I had to go on medication for it. I told her I couldn’t believe I was on BP meds at only 26 and she said, “I know, you need to get your anxiety under control” and I said well you know it doesn’t really work like that. And she said, “EVERYONE has anxiety” 

**IT IS NOT THE SAME F*CKING THING!!!!!**

She just raises her voice at me and tries to talk over me and to me she’s telling me my anxiety is fake and stupid and if she does it one more time I swear I am going to lose my MIND"
2782,Anxiety,Does anyone have stories about taking anti depressants for general anxiety/ panic attacks/ agoraphobia/ social anxiety?,
2783,Anxiety,DAE have anxiety that stems from a lack of control?,"Yesterday, my  therapist and I discovered that a lot (most actually) of my anxiety stems from not being in control and being in unfamiliar situations.

For example:

\- feeling anxious when my bf takes longer than usual to reply leads to me feeling like something is wrong 

\- feeling anxious when there is a problem at work and I don't know how to deal with it or don't know the answers

\- feeling anxious of the unknown leads me to worry about impossible scenarios 

How do you let go of control? How do you learn to just go with the flow and not hold so tightly to having things in your control?"

I am diagnosed with Generalized anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, Agoraphobia, and OCD. Therapy has been so incredibly helpful and finally after a few years of going I took the first test for the GED. Language Arts. And I passed it! It was long and hard, especially the extended response, and my anxiety had me shaking throughout it all, but I did it! I'm scheduling to take the social studies test next. I was so excited and proud of myself!! I was so happy and proud that I posted to another sub that I did it and that it's never too late to get what you want done! Everyone was really supportive until I got on this afternoon. 

One comment said ""Its an incredibly easy test thats designed to be passed by people with a bare minimum of education (no post secondary).
Setting the bar pretty low as far as accomplishments go, dont you think?""

My heart fell. I never thought about it that way before. Should I really be excited and proud now? I just feel stupid."
2787,Anxiety,I was diagnosed with schizophrenia around 7-8 years ago and to this day I’m scared I’m actually schizophrenic,"To clarify, both my current psychiatrist and psychologist doubt this original diagnosis. I’m scared because I match all the positive and negative symptoms except hallucinations or hearing voices. The person who screened me spent 3-4 sessions going over various tests and behavior observations. Very thorough screening process. I realize that mental health is a complex field with overlapping symptoms for virtually every disorder. I have that flat affect look going on for many years and I have issues with fine motor skills. I also have some delusions although they aren’t crazy like someone is speaking to me through a tv etc. it’s all based around my own insecurities. Basically my thoughts are not organized and I’ve always been insecure about my speech ability. I’ve been diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression,  anxiety , ADHD, social anxiety, and partially ocd. I’ve been worried for many years I was somehow gay because I didn’t show interest in girls but th turned out to be a chronic delusion that has since been resolved. Now I’m obsessed with schizophrenia. Fuck me :/"

2791,Anxiety,Anxiety is ruining my life,"I need help. It’s never been this bad and I don’t know what’s going on. 

I can’t do anything. I can’t go to the grocery store. My fridge is completely empty and I’ve resorted to eating completely weird food combos out of things I have left to eat. Like noodles and beans. I try to go but I just sit in the parking lot scared and decide I’d rather be hungry than anxious. 

I can’t go get gas to fill my car up. I can’t go apply for a new job after mine was lost in the pandemic. My unemployment is dwindling away. 

I’ve asked my mom for help but she won’t help me because she doesn’t want to enable me. I don’t want her to do it for me..just with me. 

I can’t go outside. I want to take walks so badly and I feel depressed and crazy being inside all the time but my anxiety won’t let me. I’ve missed so many parties and get togethers with friends and I can’t even tell them why. I can’t tell them what’s going on. Nobody would understand. 

The very bad weather with thunderstorms and recent fireworks has also been hell. I just have to sit covering my ears and hoping it will be over. 

I can’t live like this. I’m trapped and I don’t know how to get better. Therapy isint working. Meds aren’t working. Nothing is working 🥺"
2792,Anxiety,I had a pretty major epiphany about how anxiety and depression are related the other night.,"This is not an “oh wow I’m cured” moment, but maybe this will help some of you. Depression and anxiety are often talked about like they’re tightly intertwined with one another. For a long time, I didn’t really understand this. Im anxious as hell, but am I depressed? I definitely am sometimes, but I don’t feel depressed 24/7. So what could be going on? What even is anxiety if not a form of depression? When I asked myself this it kind of blew my mind. 

I realized that anxiety is something your mind does to you as a corrective measure. You feel you’re inadequate in some way that you can’t accept and can’t possibly live with, so you try relentlessly to fix what you feel is wrong with you. That’s what anxiety is. It’s like strangling yourself. It’s really a deep form of depression. And it’s a depression that can’t accept itself. There are ideas about yourself that you can’t live with so you try to snuff them out, but this doesn’t work and you know it. That’s what causes the inner tension you feel, you try to fix things that can never be fixed. But maybe you should ask yourself this: Why should you fix these things in order to appease other people? What does their approval even mean? What does their acceptance look like? Why is it valuable at all? Why do you have to kowtow to their expectations? Why do you assume they even have any expectations of you?


At some point you learned that you had to snuff yourself out and conform and fall in line with the crowd, but you shouldn’t do that. The best person you can be is not a cheapened version of someone else, but your unrestrained self. I know that sounds cliché, but it’s true. Nobody does them better than them and nobody does you better than you. Don’t hate yourself. You’re probably a really cool and sweet person. If you weren’t, you wouldn’t have had these problems in the first place. It’s just something to think about."

2797,Anxiety,Imagine having anxiety since childhood which made you insecure about yourself so you questioned your sexuality and worried that people in high school and college thought you were gay and were looking at you or talking about you,"And then getting diagnosed with schizophrenia and having even more anxiety about that stigma. Then, getting 3-4 other diagnoses that dispute schizophrenia but still leave you searching the internet because you have most of the schizophrenia symptoms"
2798,Anxiety,How to explain my anxiety to my boyfriend,"I think he wants to learn and understand but I just don’t know how to really explain it, and It definitely is a bit of an obstacle in our relationship. 

For some context/examples. I often ask him if he’s mad at me. I also say sorry a lot. Sometimes if I feel I have disappointed him, I get very worked up and upset about it to the point of tears. The other day I was having some discomfort with sex and asked him to stop and it caused quite a meltdown because I felt bad and worried for not pleasing him. Certain things like his tone or how he words something can also really cause my anxiety because I’ll just over analyze it so much. I know this is probably frustrating and tiring for him to deal with. 

If he doesn’t text back for several hours, I can get a bit agitated and worried because I’ll think he never wants to talk to me again, or that he’s mad at me, or that something terrible has happened to him. 

I also sometimes take a bit longer with getting out of the apartment than he’d like, because I have to do my little “checks” in each room. To make sure everything is fine. I’m not really sure what I’m checking for but the point is I have to do it, to make sure everything is fine. And then I have to check the cat. 

Another thing is that I need him to tell me when he’s leaving to come over, on his way over, and when he’s here. For some reason him abruptly saying he’s here without me having time to “prepare” is a big spike in anxiety for me. It makes a HUGE difference. 

I also sometimes feel like I pester him about certain things. Like if we are hanging out later that day, I need to ask him to make sure we are that morning. Later this week he’s helping me with my fish tank and I’ve already asked him three times if he’s sure he can help me. 

Last big thing is I feel a lot of anxiety if he criticizes any “plans” I’m sharing with him. Usually these plans are very very thought out, to the very last detail, and if I hear someone say any criticism about it, or even an alternative suggestion, I get really agitated and upset. In my head it’s like “I went through all these scenarios and put all this mental effort into going through all these plans down to the t to make sure they work and you made me anxious about my plan and now I’m upset because I have to start over and get new reassurance”. This is probably the biggest hurdle. 

I think this ^ comes out as me acting like my way is the best way and that his opinions are dumb but that’s not how I feel at all. It’s just that I feel like any changed, ni matter how smol, to the “plan” Ive come up with mean I have to start over again and it just really frustrates me. 

I can’t do certain things.. like go through a car wash. And other stupid things. And he doesn’t understand what I mean when I tell him its my anxiety. 

I get really agitated and worked up over things sometimes and sometimes I just need a little mental break if I’m feeling over stimulated. I usually am very good at keeping composure but when I get anxious and phrazzled and try to walk away, he’s doesn’t understand that I’m just trying to calm down again so I don’t freak out. 

I know I need to really work on these things. For myself, him, and for our relationship. And I am. I go to therapy regularly and take meds. I just.. don’t know how to convey all this to him. I feel a bit embarrassed and confused as to how to tell him.

I’ve thought about seeing therapist with him. Sending articles. All that. Just not sure how to go about it. Any advice v appreciated."

2802,Anxiety,Coaxil/Tianeptine time to work?,"Hi everyone... I've been diagnosed with GAD and have been prescribed Coaxil/Tianeptine and Xanax. My doctor said that coaxil has the fewest side effects. Been taking them for 10 days but the panic is still there.
He keeps asking if it's getting better but I do not know how to evaluate this... I still have anxious thoughts.
I've been reading about escitalopram and seen that it has a lot of good reviews. 
How long should I stick to the current plan? 
Has anyone else tried coaxil? Did it work for you?
 How do you realize the meds are working?
I have anxiety thinking that the meds don't work..."
2803,Anxiety,Hi. I am in a very bad place.,I am being backed into corner by problems that are mounting and smothering. All i see is despair and dread. Im sorry but I have nowhere to share my problems. Im so scared. This is being brought about by seeing loved one's suffer and i can't do anything to help. It's unbearable.
2804,Anxiety,Been citalopram for almost a month. Withdrawl questions advice?,I've been on citalopram for a month and just recently found out that I have graves disease involving my throid which has been causing my anxiety and panic attacks. I've only been on citalopram 20 mg for almost a month. Will I go through a bad withdrawl? How much should i taper? And how long will the withdrawl be? It's my first time on a SSRI and need advice on coming off of it. Thanks!
2805,Anxiety,I feel like I’m stuck in a cycle,"Ever since I started having attacks, I feel like my days have just blurred together. I think about how things were before and I feel like a totally different person, like this stuff has changed me fundamentally. When it started, I was going through a lot of different things. I had a lot of pain and worry in my heart, and it made sense for me to feel the way I felt. But those things have changed since then. Now I’m doing well on the outside: getting along better with my family, having a better relationship with my girlfriend, and doing well with school. But this feeling hasn’t left. And although I haven’t had an attack in a while now, other things fill the gap. For the past few days I’ve felt this tension in my neck, up near my carotid, and it makes me feel like somethings wrong. When I relax it goes away but when I think about it it instantly comes back and I’ve had to stop myself from scrolling online and freaking myself out with medical articles. But I’ve been to the doctor recently and they told me that my health is fine. I’m worried that because of my anxiety I’ve gotten into this cycle of worrying about my health and that worry is turning into real symptoms that are just making everything worse. Can anyone relate to this?"

2807,Anxiety,ra p * victim," 

Hello, my name is Cayden Bunce and this is my confession. I want to admit that for the last few years i have been facing PTSD from the rap\* my dad put me through for years. Tonight I snapped and completely lost it. While we were eating supper i decided to take a knife and threaten him to beg for forgiveness. He took the knife of me and rap\*d me again. He promised me he would never fucking do this again. I need somebody in the area to get me a gun. I will pay hard cash. I will start by killing my rapist dad. If you can do this we can make huge changes. We can make a list of killings to do, i was thinking about going to the mall and shooting up some nazis. pedos. #BLM #fight

if you want to sell me guns, dm me for my # my street is 143 Clitheroe Rd Grafton ON CANADA

if you're not local, dont hit me up. Please.

This is not a swatting post. I can dm proof of my therapy before hand."
2808,Anxiety,Please Help!!!! I’m having a Anxiety Attaxk,"It sounds stupid but, it was triggered by drink a cola drink that didn’t satisfy me and made me feel like to vomit, then I started feeling all weird and started dwelling on it and now I can’t get the feeling out of my mind that I’m going to have a seizure."
2809,Anxiety,How to calm down when meeting new people,I am going to my boyfriends cabin for his birthday and hes invited over 10 people who im sure are great people but I cannot get over the fear of meeting them. He told me he was only inviting a certain amount of people so I mentally prepared myself for it and I was doing okay when I thought about it. The trip is in 5 days and some things happened where his brother invited someone else who wasn't supposed to be for reasons but now my bf felt bad and invited her and her bf. I have never met her before in person and she may also bring some more friends. This is taking a huge toll on me and I can't seem to get myself away from this awful feeling. My heart sinks every time I think about it and I get really anxious. How do I deal with this while not being a party pooper and actually have fun at the party?
2810,Anxiety,I hate my anxiety so much,My anxiety loves to make me think that my best friend hates me and is just trying to be nice when we hang out. Last night i was crying on my bathroom floor because i thought she hated me and wanted nothing to do with me. I have to text her and ask her if she is actually my friend and i hate doing that because she gets kind of mad when i ask.
2811,Anxiety,Does anyone get rashes/hives with stress and anxiety even without a current attack?,"Like some redness spots on your skin but usually torso or arms . It usually goes away in like a hour or something.

I have crippling severe health anxiety to the point I’ve considered taking my life over my health fears to get away from the stress.

I was seeing flashes in my eyes and was convinced I have retina damage and gonna go blind and was crying hysterically. I noticed after I calmed down I had a huge thick hive on my torso. I wonder if it was coincidence and I have a slow progressing terminal unknown rare illness or it was from emotion.

Also, today I recently had some flushed areas on my chest, I didn’t have a panic attack today but I was stressed all day. Like I was stressed about my health but I didn’t panic so it’s like my health anxiety was right on my shoulder but it didn’t cause full blown panic. 

I was stressed all day to the point I just now showered at 1:30 AM and had a bowel movement that I been holding all day in fear my #2 will show signs of parasites/worms or internal bleeding. Also didn’t wanna shower because I didn’t wanna look at my skin and see a rash and think I have endocrine cancer or something"

2814,Anxiety,Story...,"25 Male Indian

IBS. GERD. ANXIETY

I started getting popping in sternum recently, and I am sure it was due to slouching a lot. It spread to the right side of my chest and was effected by movement. Then I started getting random shortnews of breath and numb feeling. Lately I have been getting pain in my left arm, and also left chest around the pec. I do not burp alot, used to. I do not understand. Random shortness or breath is more like a feeling of not able get enough, I can exercise through it. I also feel all tensed up. My neck hurts sometimes and is stiff, long working hours on laptop.  What should I do. No history of heart problems in family and diet has been amazing since lockdown. Moderate exercises. Here to talk it out with you all."
2815,Anxiety,I’m honestly not sure what to do,"I don’t know if this is triggering, it might be if other people’s anxiety makes you anxious. But basically last year I was diagnosed with severe GAD after running out of the house in the snow, post-college applications season. It was just too much for me, plus my best friend was traveling in a dangerous country. But the thing is that the psychiatrist just sort of gave me that diagnosis within a half hour of our first encounter. I developed a distrust for psychiatrists because it seemed like he was just guessing. 

But then fast forward to now. I’m emetophobic and paranoid. I don’t eat much anymore because I’m afraid of throwing up; I don’t sleep much because I’m anxious in the dark; and I don’t get out of bed until afternoon for reasons of anxiety too. 

But here’s the thing. I’m not sure if this is generalized anxiety - it seems to only apply to health and to safety. During the day, I’m mostly fine; I go on walks, I’m mostly productive at work, and I drive myself around sometimes in a car. So this isn’t severe either, because I’m still able to do those things. My question is if this is even grounds to see a therapist at all? I don’t feel comfortable taking the time slot from someone else who might need the therapist more. 

Thank you for your time, and for bearing with me as I type a long winded question. I hope I posted correctly - I’m new to the sub and I apologize if I messed up"
2816,Anxiety,Am I the only one who does this?,"Does anyone else do this thing:  

I'll notice I'm breathing shallow, or not at all so I take some deep breaths.  I concentrate on my breath to show it down and breathe deep, but then I can't stop thinking about it or I'll stop breathing. As if breathing stopped being an automatic process. Then I get stuck for a while.  I think these are like micro anxiety attacks or something, I dont know, is that crazy?"
2817,Anxiety,Fear of being hated,I have anxiety and right now my worst nervousness is around people’s opinion on me. Is it normal to fear that nobody cares about you or everyone hates you? How do you deal with the constant fear?
2818,Anxiety,Lichen simplex,My doctor just diagnosed me with lichen simplex. Does anyone else have this condition? It’s supposedly more common in people with anxiety and OCD. How do others manage it? I am worried (of course) about my skin health :(
2819,Anxiety,Something I think about,"Warning: could be triggering to those who experience car anxiety

Sometimes I’ll be driving in the car with someone, and I just think to myself:
“If the person driving turns the steering wheel slightly too fast or in the wrong way, we could run off the road and we could die.” Or something alone those lines.
It doesn’t affect me to the point where I start panicking, but it’s always a thought in the back of my mind. Does this happen to anyone else?"
2820,Anxiety,Looking for Support,"A month ago now I moved to a different province (during a pandemic). I was an absolute stress bucket. But my fiancé and I have been planning the move for a long time now and we just decided it was time for us to start a better life for ourselves. I quit my job that survived the pandemic and left my support system at home. Since being here I have had at times, crippling anxiety. I haven’t been able to find work and it seems like my fiancé is settling in a lot better than I am, which makes me happy for him but angry for myself. When it comes to job hunting I feel under-qualified for everything. Right now it feels like I left an OK life at home for a place where I haven’t been able to make friends, find work, and I don’t have the majority of my support system with me. Im looking for advice if you guys have got any, I’m also just looking to vent I guess."
2821,Anxiety,Has anxiety affected your preference of careers?,"I used to want a competitive legal career... but im just less interested in that now. I actually dream of something much simpler, like a librarian or art history. 
My wishes have changed.

Has anyone else found their anxiety disorder influence their career dreams?"
2822,Anxiety,"My story, For Encouragement it does get better","I’m going to try to compact this so it’s not too long.
I grew up in the poorest neighborhood in my city with drug addicted parents that abused me and my siblings daily. We didn’t have food or proper clothes as my parents spent all of their money on drugs. This “wired” me for anxiety. Then my parents kicked me out on my 18th birthday. I did a lot of couch surfing at first, got my first job and was ok. However the stress of fending for myself by myself in this world with my already wired brain caused me to develop an extreme anxiety disorder. I didn’t sleep and couldn’t function which caused me to lose my job and friends. I put myself in the psych ward which was ok but ended up homeless shortly after which made things worse. I’ve had many symptoms and things was hard but I didn’t give up. I found a good therapist and worked extremely hard (extremely is an understatement). Over time I learned to calm down and things got better. Now I’m in a good place financially and mentally and life is fantastic. There was a lot of detail but I left it out for length I just want to spread the message that it does and can get better but it takes work. Stay safe my friends ."
2823,Anxiety,I have come to learn that i may have been the toxic person in my friendship.,My anxiety created a narrative that made sense that i believed i had proof that my friend was upset at me. This narrative kept building until we had a big fight today and i was ready to end the friendship.The proof i thought i had wasnt about me. I feel insane. Im in shock. I don't know what to do.  But i cant stop hating myself for doing this.
2824,Anxiety,I feel on the edge of a catastrophe (health anxiety),"I have a sore throat and other upper respiratory symptoms for nearly a month. My nerves and anxiety are constantly high since week 2 began (first week was ok bc I thought of a regular cold). I've been to the doctor twice, they couldn't see anything. I got tested for covid but its negative. 
Today I have a specialist appointment and I am SO FREAKING SCARED they send me away. This whole ""i don't know/ can't see anything wrong/ etc"" is as worse as the fear of something bad. Be it a diagnose or that they dont believe I have some kind of inflammation and it spreads to the heart because I need to work physically at my job.
I started a new job and I am also so scared to lose it because I have already been sick last week because of this. So no matter what happens, it's always going to be some kind of catastrophy with risking my job as the least threat. I have to pay for my studies, I have to take my university exams soon and I don't feel capable of any of this. I am usually a decent student but I couldn't learn for my exams. I am also angry because I feel so alone and as if professionals don't take me seriously and won't help and I have to wait and risk my life.
I feel like running away or numbing myself and I just want peace in my life again. I am going to therapy but I currently feel like 45 mins every 2 weeks is no good. I also don't have energy to do any exercises from therapy because my worries about health, future and life are all consuming right now.
I honestly feel like there's no escape but I can just hope for a minor crisis like losing my job while adding an (expensive) semester to my studies because of failing these exams. Well if I just get help for my symptoms fine I'll take that of course. Please send good thoughts so the doctor will help me today.
But I feel so scared that in the evening I will be disappointed, turned away again by another doctor. I have to work tomorrow but I am so scared of being sick and dying."
2825,Anxiety,jaw locks when I yawn and brush teeth?,"so if I open my mouth too wide it locks for like 10 seconds and until I force it back to normal and I’m left with soreness... It doesn’t happen all the time, but I’m a little concerned is this because of anxiety or am I developing jaw problems? or is this normal?"
2826,Anxiety,Anxiety causing tingling?,"So a while ago my foot tingled and my sister mentioned diabetes. So like the smart person I am I googled and found that that tingling usually happens with years of untreated diabetes and when I went to my doctor she wasn’t concerned. Me being me I am paranoid I have it and now both my feet tingle, this only happens when im anxious and think about it and it’s literally all I think of now. It’s always in the back of my head and when I’m not thinking about it and feel normal it comes back.
Does anyone else experience tingling from anxiety and if so how do you handle it."
2827,Anxiety,Just wanna rant here I guess...,"I try so hard to do well on the English portion of my standardized exam. I work so hard..... I study so hard for it. but no matter how hard I try, I still can’t be better.... why am I so stupid. Everyone else who started at the same level as me has now improved drastically. But then there’s me. Still here. Getting so many questions wrong per passage... sometimes I wonder if the Higher Power has given up on me."
2828,Anxiety,Don't know how to title this,"This is pretty strange but I found I'm incredibly afraid of being wrongfully institutionalized.  To be clear, there's no real reason for that to happen, nothing close.   But this scene keeps playing out in my head.  I like to laugh a lot, often at ordinary things. I keep imagining one day I'll start laughing at something random in public, people will think I'm crazy, which will just make me laugh harder since I'm perfectly sane.  Anyway, the situation keeps escalating, and I just laugh even more at the absurdity of the situation.  Eventually, I get sent to an institution of some sort, and I try to convince the people their that I'm perfectly sane, but no one believes me because they think I'm just trying to trick them.  Then over time, the place wears me down, so I actually do lose my sanity.

So yeah, the weirdest thing is sometimes I'll be laughing hard, and this thought pops into my head and I just laugh even harder.   Idk, I know this is pretty weird, has anyone had similar thoughts/fears?"
2829,Anxiety,"Found a lil escape, it’s my heaven for now","Been having bad GAD for about two weeks now, been on edge all day with the “feeling”. 

Worked out a bit to calm myself down, got into a semi decent headspace, drank some beers and holy fuck it melted away! I feel normal it’s amazing! 

I know tomorrow is prob gonna be hell, but I don’t care. It’s so relaxing to have a few hours to just feel “calm”"
2830,Anxiety,It feel like an elephant is sitting on my chest. I need to sleep but I can’t.,"Have to be somewhere tomorrow, so I definitely need to sleep. If I don’t I’m way more fatigued and it will affect my strength to drive the distance. Don’t know what my anxiety attack is about but I can sleep or breathe it feels like."
2831,Anxiety,Does anyone else have a similar experience?,"Since I was young I would occasionally get this weird feeling between my fingers and toes which would make me have the need to stretch, rub, and constantly move them.

2 weeks ago I started to take escitalopram which made my anxiety spike and gave my panic attacks. Along with that I started to have those same feelings again but this time it will last all day or for most of the day. 

I'm assuming this feeling is connected with the anxiety but I've never found anyone that had a similar experience. Which was starting to make me overthink and think that something is wrong with me... Is it just me?"
2832,Anxiety,What can you do when you're feeling completely blank?,"Ever since I quit kpop last November (due to bs going on in the industry that I can't mention here), my mood has only continued to go downhill. I virtually never listen to music anymore, because there's just nothing as light-hearted and happy as kpop. Beyond that, I seem to just be losing interest in everything. I was in the middle of a Skyrim playthrough not too long ago, but I haven't played it, or any other game, in probably at least a month now. Over the past few days, I've literally just been spending my entire day checking news sites and refreshing reddit ()to see if I've gotten any replies) over and over again.

I really don't know what to do. Nothing else really gives me joy, so I don't see what I could go to that could cheer me up. Gaming wasn't doing it for me (Skyrim is actually a pretty dark game when you think about it). I've also been mindlessly playing sudoku games every day, even though I'm honestly getting sick of doing them at this point, but I just don't know what else to do.

I have failed to find a replacement for kpop for me. It just seems like kpop is the only thing in the entire world right now that's trying to make people happy. I did try to look up some 'meditation' music (technially I just searched for anxiety music), but I found that absolutely boring. For some reason, calm music has always bored me, even long before I started having anxiety problems.

What can I do here? I don't want to get back into kpop, because of how abusive the industry is, but at this point its becoming increasingly clear I was reliant on it, either that or after leaving it I have absolutely no positive media in my life. What can I do?

And yes, I think I suffer from anxiety rather than depression. Over the past few days I've been suddenly feeling anxious for no reason at all, which has only started happening over the past few days. I'm getting tired of only being bored, emotionless, or anxious for no reason all day long. I've never been like this, so I have no idea what I can do to pull myself out of it. In the past I probably would've just gone and watched some kpop, since it made me happy, but I don't want anything to do with that evil industry anymore, even though I still have kpop songs play in my head at least once a day despite not actually hearing a kpop song for 6 months now."
2833,Anxiety,Hi my name is Brian and I'm anxious,"TLDR:I have never expirienced such constant physical effects from anxiety. When the physical effects of anxiety were becoming more prevalent to you how did you accept it and begin to work on it? 


I'm in the military. I've always had what I would characterize as general anxieties. While never debilitating; social anxieties, aversion to public speaking, and worries about general life happenings  have always walked with me like a shadow. I've been aware of these and have worked on them, and have lived a relatively uninhibited life regarding stress/anxiety. For reasons I can't seem to definitively explain I've begun experiencing significantly more physcial anxiety on the tail end of my deployment. Manifesting itself as lightheadedness, shakiness, rapid and shallow breathing, hot flashes, and even a full blown panic attack at one point (yikes). While I believe it's due to mold poisoning(VA disability holla at me) the effects are incredibly real and it pisses me off so much that I feel like I do while doing things I'd normally have 0 issue with. That being said I'm recieving help, and am eager to do something positive about it and manage this. Thanks for reading, and any thoughts or well wishes.  

P.S Those of you who live with these feelings are so damn strong to be able to get up and face every day even though it is filled with anxiety and fear. I'm proud of all of you for continuing in the face of this omnipresent adversity. You're doing great."
2834,Anxiety,What’s helped me come over my crippling anxiety.,"Anxiety more often than not does 100% nothing or 99.99% no service to you, I feel like a large part of my problem and perhaps yours is believing that I needed the anxiety to learn from past mistakes and to learn as a forms of not screwing up again and punishment for my naive actions, but this leads me way more out harm than good with me being paraylyzed and often times procrastinating from how much anxiety I’m in, for making such a large mistake and often times makes it harder for what I have to do because I don’t want to screw up again. My advice may not work for everyone but what’s helped me is just realizing anxiety does absolutely nothing for you, even when you screw up and need to learn your lesson, have some of it but don’t beat yourself forever. you procrastinated all day today, feel no anxiety it will just make your harder to sleep, and waste time thinking about how much you wasted time. And anxiety is what causes procrastination in the first place. I wish you well friends! Realizing this has dramatically helped me and I hope it helps. Anxiety is a lose lose situation, because anxiety wastes time which makes your anxiety worst and the cycle repeats."
2835,Anxiety,Anxiety or something else ?,"22F 5’2 155 lbs 
Hi, for the past year I have had various symptoms come and go after what my doctor says was a panic attack. Prior to the panic attack I had no symptoms of anxiety or any health issues other than Vitamin D deficiency. There is a long long list of symptoms that I have experienced since that panic attack but currently I am suffering with these:

Ringing in ears 
Head pressure 
Nose pressure 
Hot flashes 
Headaches 
Nausea 
Light sensitivity 
What I can only describe as dissociation 
Dizziness 
fatigue 

I had tried Zoloft, Buspirone and hydroxyzine and none seem to help. Is there anything I should ask the doctor to check for ? They dismiss all my symptoms as anxiety but It’s been over a year  now and there are days the symptoms are so bad I can barely get out of bed. I appreciate any help thank you"
2836,Anxiety,Does anyone else feel like no one takes anxiety seriously?,"I'm really struggling at the moment with work being a major trigger for me. I've been telling my supervisor and even went to HR saying I can't cope and asked for help but I'm just being ignored and nothing seems to get done.

When I mention my anxiety to my friends and family, they don't seem to understand so I feel like I can't talk about how ad it actually is.

I'm at a point where I'm getting ideations about harming myself, partly to make the anxiety go away and a small part to show people how badly I'm suffering.

Anyone else feel like this?"

2838,Anxiety,Xanax,"I’ve been an anxious person my whole life but 5 years ago I began to be under extreme stress with a business and relationships issues. I forgot to mention that I have major family issues too, as I do t speak to my parents or siblings because they’re disputing my wife and I. I always hope I don’t regret dumping them as they say they love me and miss me but treat me like a second class citizen as my family is all women except for me and they on some weird girls rule boys drool trip. Anyways I was just prescribed Xanax and I don’t feel much plus still have the anxiety. Anybody else fell Xanax leant help their anxiety much?"

Im a very quiet and shy dude, and I really only have a handful of people to hangout with during school. Quarantine was a blessing for me because of how stressed and how much my anxiety spiked when I went to school. I feel that everyone thinks I’m weird and don’t want to talk or engage with me. I find it extremely hard to start a conversation with someone. Honestly, I feel like I’ve been dealing with some underlying mental issues that have cussed me to be very asocial. I go to sleep every night stressed about how this is one less day of summer, and how I’m going to have to go to school again. I have a low self esteem as well and I’m more sensitive to people’s words. I am incredibly stressed and worried about how best year will go. I really want to feel better, so does anyone have anything to help with my anxiety? As in how to feel like I fit in or how to gain self esteem? I’ve had pretty bad anxiety for a couple years but high school was were it peaked so far. Please, if anyone has a suggestion, tell me."

I’ve been wearing masks, staying home, not partying or doing anything dumb. I tried so hard. And I still fucking got it. My boyfriend is out of state right now and I’m in complete panic.

2843,Anxiety,Family Party,"I was forced to go to a family party. You see, I don't know anything about my relatives, and striking conversations makes me sick and anxious. I was there for only 4 hours, but I was still to anxious. I'm very quiet, and overall just a mute person. It took me 30 minutes just to ask for water, because I was afraid that I would disturb my cousin who was playing a bean bag game. Thankfully, I did have a friend call me (I just keep myself muted and type whilst she talks || and I'm used to talking with her), she did help me calm down, but sadly she had to go a bit later. 
I tried picking up a lid to some food, but ended up dropping, while one of relatives said loudly, 'good job!'. So, I just stood there for a moment, because I thought I made a scene. I left soon after, happy I got home so I don't have speak.
Sorry to vent, I just don't know where else to."

2847,Anxiety,Eating when anxiety makes you lose appetite,"I (30M) suffer from GAD and I'm having a bad anxiety attack that started Sunday night. Point is I can't eat and even drinking water is hard.

I only ate a snack since anxiety kicked in. I have a dinner tonight and I don't want to go and eat nothing, everyone will focus on me and I don't want it.

I'm already on my meds but it doesn't seem they're working. 

What can I do?"
2848,Anxiety,I feel so guilty about this,"Yesterday I was masturbating. I don’t like watching porn as it’s too hardcore for me, so if I do watch it, I look for more ethical sites. I decided to google a celebrity I find attractive and use a picture and my imagination. I googled her name “****** sexy hot” and it came up with pictures, as I was scrolling down, it came up with a picture of her and her children. I immediately clicked back and looked at something else but I feel guilty for that even happening."
2849,Anxiety,Morning Routines,"For those of you that work what is your morning routine like? I have a ton of anxiety in the mornings and am having a hard time functioning trying to get ready. 

I usually get up with stomach cramps and nausea and choke down a larabar while I’m dry heaving so I can take my meds and then I shower, meds start working and things are a bit easier but still having nausea. Then, I do clothes and hair, eat cereal (the hardest part because of nausea) and last I check the house (doors locked and things unplugged). This routine is not working very well and I was looking for suggestions."
2850,Anxiety,"Instead of being excited to go on vacation, I’m apprehensive. Always.","Saturday I’ll be heading a measly hour away from home to go to a beach house for the week. 

Instead of looking forward to it, I’m dreading it. I want to go! I’m just nervous. I’m afraid I will (or already have) contract covid and will be sick during my vacation. I’m a hypochondriac and have severe health anxiety. (I’m one of those people who gets sick on or around Christmas a lot so the pessimist in me says, “My luck, I will be.”)

Does anyone else feel this way when there’s a certain event or vacation approaching? I want to be able to enjoy myself but since my home is my “haven” of sorts, its hard for me. 

Why cant i think like a normal person and be happy/grateful I’m going away for a week??"

2854,Anxiety,I'm going out to eat ON MY OWN!!!,"Last week I was diagnosed with depression, and my week after that sucked. About 10 minutes ago I left from my therapist and it was a really good session. I was planning on getting some food and going home to eat it there but I suddenly felt a really big urge to go in the city. So now I'm sitting in my favourite restaurant on my own and I'm feeling kinda anxious but I am hella hungry and I want to go through with it because I freaking deserve it. I'm so proud of myself for doing this on my own"

2856,Anxiety,How can I ease my anxiety regarding losing a beloved animal?,"Hey everyone. I hope your day is going fantastic so far.

So I'm sixteen years old, and I'm dealing with severe anxiety. It's absolutely unbearable. I often stay up late because of anxious and intrusive thoughts (usually regarding ""symptoms"" of awful diseases I think I find in myself), and my brain is constantly busy with those thoughts throughout my entire day. I feel like I have nowhere to escape from these thoughts, and it's terrifying.

Ever since I got my horse Chamomile, I've been dealing with more and more of these intrusive and anxious thoughts regarding the day I will eventually have to say goodbye to her. It's so terrible it gets to the point I regret even getting her in the first place. The thought of losing her is unbearable, I can't even put it into words. I' can't stretch how terrified I am of feeling that kind of pain.

I tried pretty much everything, even living by the belief that once I die we will meet again and that her death would not be an actual final goodbye. It helped a bit, but not enough. I don't really know how to put this into words, but I'm absolutely miserable with these thoughts. Does anyone here have any tips on what I can do to ease them?

Thank you, and have a great day."

2858,Anxiety,DAE hates waking other people up?,"Whenever someone asks me if I can wake them up it gives me so much anxiety.

It seems like a simple request, “hey, if you wake up before me, can you wake me up?”, and I always agree but when I actually have to do it I panic. 

Did they really ask me to do that? What if they didn’t expect me to wake up this early and will be annoyed that I woke them up? Do I touch them gently? Do I slap them? Will they get angry that I woke them up in the wrong way? 

And that makes me just stand there paralyzed unable to wake them up. Then I panic more because it’s creepy to stand over a sleeping person...

It’s pretty specific but maybe I’m not the only one :&lt;"

2861,Anxiety,Subconscious anxiety,I am getting alot hypochondriac these days in lockdown. I don't think anything but still i get panic attacks and scared feelings.

2862,Anxiety,Anybody have tips to get my ass to bring my car to the mechanic?,"I have been putting this off for weeks cause the mere thought of going gives me extreme anxiety. I've brought my car to this mechanic before but every time there was something, like I forgot to leave him the keys or some parts were missing, the manual was missing, whatever. 

Last time I went was 6 months ago to have a general check-up and he told me I should definitely have the brakes replaced by January which, of course, I didn't do and now I can literally hear metal grinding on metal every time I step on the brakes. I really really need to get this car back going but I'm scared.

Like, in theory I know he probably won't remember any of this and he won't care even if he did but my nerves are getting the better of me since I've had so many bad experiences in the past with him, which is in no way his fault but I'm scared I'll fuck something up again and due to my CPTSD I would 100% start crying if he in any way scolded or critisized me for not taking care of my car.

I'm freaking out but this is so important for me to do, any of you guys have any tips on how to get myself to do it? Would be very appreciated!"
2863,Anxiety,I want everyone to feel accepted,"Last night, I hung out with my cousin and her newly male to female transgender friend (we’ll call her Amy, she’s 25). Amy was very nervous to go out in public as her and my cousin drove out of their way to come to a town (mine coincidentally) where she hoped she wouldn’t see anyone she knew, because the only people that know is her sister, my cousin and two other friends.. not even her parents know. Around 9:30pm, my cousin invited me out to meet her and Amy where I got to get to know her better, hear her story and her traumatic experiences with not understanding her sexuality until recently and her journey to coming out. We had a great time laughing and conversing, so much to the point that I lost track of time and left around 12:30am (had work at 6:30am today but it was worth it!! Lol). 

Amy told me during the night how she hadn’t gone out to drink since February and that was the most she’s felt confident in so long because she hadn’t ever talked to so many strangers at once that were so unbelievably nice to her (I live in a small town where everyone knows everyone, so I hadn’t even thought of the fact that someone else might not be used to it). After I went home, my cousin texted me at the end of the night that Amy told her she’s never felt so comfortable and accepted by anyone before us, and she said she’s had the best night she’s had in so long. I broke town in tears. The fact that a total stranger trusted me with something so huge, had an amazing time and would love to do it again made me feel so, SO happy. I know what it’s like to have social anxiety and to not feel accepted, to be bullied, and left out to dry, and all I want is for her is to feel accepted everywhere and to feel like herself with ease."
2864,Anxiety,Increased panic attacks,"I’ve been having panic attacks more and more often in the past few months. Before isolation (because of COVID) it happened less often but now it’s about every other day or twice a week. I am currently not taking any medication, I usually just try to occupy my mind with work or my dogs but it’s like I’m trapped inside my own head and I don’t seem to be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. I have a very supportive fiancé but even then I feel like I constantly disappoint him by not being strong enough to control my emotions and I can’t even explain how it happens so often now. 

It’s hard to sleep, hard to wake up, hard to even get out of bed. Yesterday I had a really bad panic attack that lasted about 30-45min. I had this urge to make myself stop feeling and at the same time I was so scared I was going to pass out cause my whole body was shaking. I was so mad at myself that I did punch myself in the legs multiple times because (I know it’s fucked up) somehow I feel like I should be punished for feeling this way and not being able to get over it. My family and friends are not very supportive or just not around since they all live far away from me so I just want to know what has helped others. I’m considering maybe starting medication since I’m really not able to stop myself from having panic attacks so often even though I see a therapist and I’m just tired. I don’t want to push away the only person who cares for me because of how fucked up beyond repair I am. 

If anyone is experiencing or has experienced this please advice what has helped or what coping mechanisms are working better for you specially now that we can’t really gather together with others. I’d really appreciate it."
2865,Anxiety,Short-term experiences with Effexor?,I’ve been going through a rough hurdle in life so my doctor prescribed me Effexor XR 37.5mg and told me I could just take it for two weeks and stop whenever I wanted. I just wanted to see if anyone else has tried Effexor for a short period of time and how effective it was. Based on what I’ve seen I don’t even know if it’s worth it to try taking it if I’m going to have to taper off or get withdrawal symptoms.
2866,Anxiety,I did an interview and my anxiety has immediately shifted....,"So I was very anxious for this job interview I had today. I prepped for days and I even took sleeping meds last night to make sure I slept. I still didn’t sleep as long as I wish I would have. Nonetheless, I did it. The interview was fine. Not the greatest as I haven’t interviewed for several years, but I didn’t lose my words too much. My issue is about midway through the interview I noticed that my anxiety shifted. I started to be concerned about whether this job would work out or not. I think this coincided with him starting to talk about me as though I was already working there. 

Now I am uneasy about the whole thing. I haven’t been offered the job but he told me he thought I would be getting an offer. Why can’t I just be normal? Why does everything need to feel like life and death? Intellectually I know it’s not but emotionally I feel like a child. Please tell me I’m not alone! Anyone have a positive outcome to share about interviewing and starting a new job?"

I keep being sick outside aswell which really isn’t helping me get over my fear as I just think about the fact I might be sick and that makes me scared to go outside. does anyone else get like this cause I’m really struggling and need some support. and does anyone know any tips or anything on how to prevent nausea or get over This?

2870,Anxiety,Not knowing if you genuinely dislike something or it's just anxiety,"Does anyone else sometimes doubt themselves when they find something not enjoyable, or even outright distressing? Everyone, anxious or not, faces situations that make them uncomfortable and they take actions to remove that discomfort. But occasionally I don't know whether something actually isn't for me, or if im just being irrational and anxious.

&amp;#x200B;

For example, I've recently returned to work since corona hit and my work has changed a bit, I really don't find it enjoyable anymore and I dread every shift. However, I'm not sure if quitting would be a sensible move to improve my quality of life, or if I should chalk this up to anxiety about returning to work and try to get over these feelings by staying, sort of like exposure therapy.

&amp;#x200B;

I also get it with relationships with other people - Is my anxiety ruining this or are they just a dick?"
2871,Anxiety,Having terrible anxieties when interact with classmates who I’m not close to (even online),"As the title said, even my uni conducts classes online, my core courses still require mostly group projects. I feel terribly anxious just by talking to someone I’m not close to.
Today we had a group discussion, my other two group mates decided to invited 4 of their mutuals whom one of my group mate will have a group discussion with for their other projects after our talk is done. They wanted to video call and I just felt so anxious on the inside, though I was able to act normal. Some of them talk about their plans and I just really wanted to get out.
My heart raced even after the call ended. To think that I have to go through this again next trimester makes me feel hopeless.
How to stop this anxiety Im having"
2872,Anxiety,It will get better,"I know that's what you hear all the time and you just wanna punch that person in the face when they say it but it's true. Depression is a chemical imbalance in your brain causing it to trigger anxiety and depression in situations that isn't appropriate.  You just gotta push through it and not stop fighting. Get help, I know a lot of people on this subreddit have either heard or had bad experiences with mental health professionals. If that person isn't doing the trick for you, then find a new therapist. Don't quit therapy and just say fuck it. If you have had a bad experience with medications then it's because it was the wrong prescription. They way all that works with getting the right meds, it's purely trial and error. It's not always the first try that the doctor gets it right. NO ONE CAN HELP YOU BUT YOU. I battled depression for only about a year but it was a pretty bad case. I became recluse and started failing classes, losing friends. I had to go through not one, not two, but 4 different med changes before they got it right, and Med changes suck cus sometimes for a couple weeks it worsens the symptoms. But you gotta push through. After attempting suicide I ended up in a mental hospital scared shitless, I didn't want to be there at all. But it made a huge positive impact on my mental health immediately. Depression and anxiety can be a real bitch. But what I heard the most often was the sooner you get help, the better, the reason why med changes and therapy sucks is because it's creating a war inside your head. And the earlier you get help the better. There's a whole life out there waiting for you. Don't give it up and don't let go of it, it will get better, and life after you concur it will be even better because you beat it. I love you guys, you have gotten me through a lot of hard times. You just gotta stick through it. I promise you that this hell hole your stuck in will one day get better and you won't realize it until your looking back and realize, you can't have happiness with out sadness. The low points are what shows you and makes you appreciate the highs. But only you can make a difference so take that first step and get some help. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.

2873,Anxiety,Did having an anxiety disorder ruin your dreams? Or career plans?,"I had some careers I planned out for my future, but thanks to developing an anxiety disorder at 18 I kissed those goodbye. My friend is living out my dream and while I try to be happy and supportive for her, it's killing me on the inside. I've worked very hard on my mental health and I've came a long way but not being able to follow my dreams have put a damper in me. I chose an alternative career path but it's still not something I truly want to do... so I accept that I'm just trying to make money to enjoy the time I don't work... but I still feel useless."
2874,Anxiety,Flushed my meds down the toilet in the middle of a panic attack. Don’t know how to tell my doctor?,"Hi guys. I posted this on the Lexapro subreddit but thought I might get good results here as well. 


I was recently started on 10mg of Lexapro from a psychiatrist I just switched away from. My new psychiatrist agreed that I should be on Lexapro for generalized anxiety. 

I told her that the first day I had a really bad panic attack in the night and i was spooked. I’ve had doubts about being started at 10mg but she said to continue for the week. 

Well last night I had a HORRIBLE panic attack in the middle of the night. I couldn’t stop trembling, I was having cold sweats, and I thought my heart would stop beating it was going so fast. I was in an absolute state of frenzy and so scared, I dumped the Lexapro down the toilet. I was terrified of them or feeling that way again. 
I was prescribed hydroxyzine and I tried taking that in the beginning of the panic attack but 10 minutes in I threw up, which idk if it was a side effect or the extreme panic attack. 

Anyway now I have no medication left and I’m supposed to continue taking it for the week before seeing my psych on Tuesday to discuss it. I’m so embarrassed that i did that and I have no idea how to tell her what happened. I don’t want to sound absolutely insane. I’ve never in my life done anything like that and that was definitely the worst panic attack I experienced so far. I don’t necessarily think i was thinking straight and was definitely in fight or flight mode. How do i approach this topic with my psych?

Has anyone experienced bad panic attacks on Lexapro??"
2875,Anxiety,Melanoma fear ruining wedding proposal — what can I do?,"My mother has been very sick and has been in and out of the hospital. My boyfriend has always been such an important support to me. I know he is planning on proposing soon. It is supposed to be the happiest time of my life, but anxiety has gotten in the way. I am convinced that I will lose him somehow. My latest worry is a mole he has on his back. He’s had it for years, and despite being slightly odd looking it has not changed at all. I try to reassure myself that he is okay, but I keep having horrible dreams of him dying from melanoma. He said he will get his skin checked for me when he starts his new job this fall. How can I enjoy his proposal (which I expect this summer) when all I can think about is losing him? What if it’s cancer? What if he dies? Thoughts like this keep racing through my mind. How can I possibly enjoy this time?"

2877,Anxiety,Hey guys I made a breakthrough this morning,"This lockdown bullshit (thanks China) has ruined my mental health to levels never thought possible. I’ve realized after all these years , my “anxiety” is actually chronic insecurity that’s never been addressed. I’ve always been a worrier and very sensitive as a kid. I think my brain is naturally hypersensitive so I pick up on things others don’t. It’s pretty much fucked me in life and caused me chronic anxiety, stress, insomnia and depression that’s lasted well over 15 years. These conditions have lead to a loss of motivation and energy which means my physical health has suffered as well. 10 years of SSRIs , anti psychotics, 5-6 diagnoses , sleep meds, sleep study, and therapy hasn’t helped. Sometimes things are simpler than they appear. I hope everyone is using this time to care of themselves and if given the opportunity, to figure out your root issues. You will save yourself  lots of time and money. Never too late to live!"

Whatever I'll still ignore it. No more calling thank god.

Time to leave my apartment as I put on my sunglasses, even though it's overcast outside. I peek and listen through the door lock because god forbid I bump into anyone in the corridor. No one's there time to get out. Oh sh\*t, someone's unlocking their door. I run down the stairs and rush out of the building.

Walking on the street I spot a huge gang of teens in front of me. I won't risk potentially being annoyed by them so I take an alternative path.

Going to the supermarket to buy my food. I'm afraid of checking out since I only have a €50 note and paying for only €4.11 worth of stuff, the cashier will probably look at me weird. I hand her the note, she inserts it into the fake money detector. Oh my god, it's beeping!. She wrinkles the note and inserts it again, all good this time. Almost had a heart attack. She gives me the change and I'm panicking to pick up all the cents as there's an entire line waiting on me. Finally I'm out of there and head back home safely."

2886,Anxiety,"Breakup because s/o had anxiety, please help","First, I apologize for the wall of text.  It just kept on coming out.

I had not dated in two years, due to just not being lucky in picking a good partner, for whatever reason.  Then, I met HER.  I met her online, as we shared a common interest.  We would casually chat, then one evening, she sent me her number and said, ""Call me, I'm over this chat thing.""  I thought it was a little fast and I asked if it was only as friends and she said ""yes""... yeah, right.  I was a bouncer for ten years and I'm about as extroverted as they come.

It progressed from chat, to talking on the phone, to Skype (and ""everything"" associated with it).  I usually date tiny, petite women.  She was a little, what she called ""thick"".  I didn't see it, but eh.  But, I thought maybe it would be good to get outside my usual dating choices.

I thought she was wonderful.  She was caring and giving, which were two things that I wasn't used to in a relationship. She had this teased, curly strawberry blonde hair and brown doe eyes.  At this point, there wasn't anything that I didn't like about her.  I'm big on trust.  If you don't have trust in a relationship, what's the point of being together?  After three months, she started slipping words into our conversation like ""boyfriend"" and ""you're the one for me"".  I let it go, even though she had expressed she wasn't ready for a relationship.  I thought she was coming around to the idea, so I let it go.  Then one day out of the blue, she says, ""I can't do this.""  Then, she just shuts everything down and says that we can be friends, but that's it.  I couldn't understand how she could just turn off her emotions and be like, ""Deal with it.""  I was hurt.  I tried to ask her if I did something wrong and she became combative.  We argued for a day and I gave up.  We didn't speak for ten days.

We started talking again, and a week later, we were right back into where we were, pre-flake out.  My gut feeling told me that something was ""amiss"", but when you really like someone, you don't listen to it.  She lived in the middle of the US and I, in the NE.  We had thrown around the idea of going down to see her (even though I swore to myself I would not do that).  She was always on the fence about it, then one day she brought it up, saying ""that she would love it if I came down to see her"".  I set a date that was a month out, ""just in case"".  I had to juggle the flights three times because something was always wrong on her end.  Now my gut feeling is getting stronger because she has already flaked out on me once.  I bring it up and she said, ""I PROMISE that I will not flake out on you this time.  Trust me, baby!""  

Fast forward 25 days... it seems like she's trying to put up little ""roadblocks"" to keep me from coming down.  I ask her if she's still okay with me coming down to see her and she says that she's excited to see me.  I was supposed to stay at her place, then two days before I'm supposed to be there, she decides that I should stay at a hotel (the nearest decent one was an hour and a half away, one way).  I told her if it meant that much to her, I'd sleep in the SUV in her driveway.  I asked her how I could have sex with her, but she won't trust me to sleep at her place.  She was the one that brought it up that I should stay at her place.  It would have cost me another $500 to get a hotel room for my stay AND it would have been a three-hour round trip to see her.  She says that all of her friends have been telling her that it was a bad idea.  That was another thing, she would let some of her friends influence how she acted towards me.  Where she was anxious about things, she always commented on how she loved how I could ground her and put her at ease.  I completely missed this because I know nothing about anxiety.

If I would have cancelled the rental car and flights to see her, 24 hours beforehand, I could have had a full refund of nearly $500.  I paced in front of the clock, thinking I should just cancel, because by now the little voice is screaming at me.  I wanted SOOO bad to be able to believe in her and trust her, so I let it go.  I call her to let her know that everything is all set and I'll see her tomorrow.  She tells me that she started her period, even though it ended ten days ago.  I'm thinking, ""and there it is, the trump card"".  I told her that it wouldn't stop us going out to dinner and doing things.  She starts trying to gaslight me, calling me a liar about something completely off the wall.  She said, ""that I forced her to like me for six months"" and ""that I forced her to let me go there and see her"".  I'm like, what the hell is going on here?  THEN, she tells me that she doesn't want to talk to me any more AND she's getting back with her ex, who is married with kids.  This guy, who she said was ""not good for her"" the whole time we were speaking.  She tells me, ""Don't come down here.  I'm getting back together with him and you coming here won't change a thing.""  I told her that she could have told me this six hours ago and I wouldn't have wasted $500.  She didn't care one bit.  This was all over text.  I practically begged her to call me and she said that she didn't have the time right now.

I'm devastated.  She crushed my heart, then blocked my cell number and on a chat we were on.  All I can think about now, is how she is with her married ex and here I am, hurt as hell when I should have just followed my gut feeling.  I want so bad to mail her a letter, asking for some kind of explanation.  I know that we'll never be getting back together.  It's probably a good move if I never contact her again, but it's so damn hard right now to suppress that.  It's been 12 days since all of that occurred and I'm still thinking of her and what went awry.  My brain won't stop thinking about it.

I'm hoping that someone here can please shine some light on this for me.  I've been reading articles on the internet about how anxiety can destroy a relationship, but hearing it from someone would be better.  I'd like to think that if someone really cares about someone, they could conquer their anxiety.  After all of the reading that I've done, it appears that I'm holding out on false hope.  I miss her so bad and being a man, I don't know where to put all of this.  It's not something that I've ever experienced.  Thank you so much to anyone that can give me any kind of positive feedback!

TL;DR My ex s/o has an anxiety issue.  She crushed my heart for what seems to me, for no reason.  As an added bonus, she intentionally said some things to hurt me further.  Words were exchanged over text and now, she has completely shut me out of her life."
2887,Anxiety,DAE become anxious when small talk stops,"I absolutely love talking about complex topics with like 1 or 2 close people, but when it's not them, I feel like the only way I can communicate is through small  talk.  With most people I have a script in my head of what I'm going to say: 

""Hello, how are you doing""
""That's good, I'm glad you are doing well""
""Have a nice rest of your day""

 Everytime the topic moves away from the script in my head I get so anxious and my brain freaks out. I panic about what I'm going to say. ""What if I embarrass myself? What if I say something that hurts their feelings? What if they hate me?"" 

I know small talk is as boring as watching paint dry, but it's safe. DAE feel this way?"

2889,Anxiety,Anxiety over the way of the world.,"I do not feel like I'm coping well with how the world is going. 


First quarantined away from my family, who I miss alot and were a huge support system for me, and the internet helped me stay occupied but now I can't look away from social media, it's all horrible and deaths and racism and there's so many conspiracies and anger from both sides and evils and I just can't cope.... 


I try to stay away from social media, but then it's all over the t.v, so I avoid that too, then something new will happen that is equally appalling and me or my BIL will hear about it, and start talking about it until we have 2 hour conversations on how the world is fucked and how things need to change and again, is just can't cope. 


I've stayed up late all week because my brain is going turbo, every video I've watched get replayed in my head and I can hear people screaming for their lives. 


I  don't know how to get out of my own head, I literally want to drop off the grid for a few days but could I cope with that? Nope."
2890,Anxiety,I HATE ANXIETY,I can hardly leave the house. I panic almost every time I go out and having to wear a mask everywhere doesn’t help. I still wear it but I feel like I’m suffocating. I’m supposed to go back to work soon and I’m scared as hell because I haven’t interacted with children since March. Ughhhh my brain is always going 100 miles an hour it feels like
2891,Anxiety,Anyone else having panic attacks when protesting?,"I've never really had problems with large crowds like concerts, lecture halls etc..

But I went to my first peaceful protest the other day. It was ran by students at my university so I figured it would remain peaceful as most of them do and this one did remain peaceful. 

We were marching on the main Street on our university. And since school is out there were barely any cars and the ones who did had to drive maybe two blocks to get around. So there wasn't any real threat or reason the protest would escalate. 

I live in Minneapolis Minnesota, so all these protests have been new to me. And the whole ordeal started here so my anxiety has been through the roof since I've kinda been at ground zero. 

I went with my friend. And as soon as the leaders of the protest said that we will not resist and we wall stand against the cops. And said that the white people (I am white) of the protest need to shield and wall off the police my anxiety just shot through. Apple watch had my heart rate at 120 for about 5 mins straight, and I knew I was having a panic attack. I even ditched my friend and had to get out of there to try and calm down. I've been scared to go back to one ever since."
2892,Anxiety,Do you relate?,"Does anyone else get an overwhelming anxious feeling when a loud plane passes over your house? I don't know why i feel this way. I know it's highly unlikely for a plane to crash into my house or for a plane to drop anything on my specific house, but I cant help but feel this way. Lol. The saddest part is I live pretty close to an airport so I should be used to it by now. I've asked my friends of they also all this way, but they all said no.. So i was just wondering if anyone else can relate."
2893,Anxiety,i always feel like i’m dying,"honestly i am fairly positive that this is just anxiety but i have been getting frequent chest pain whenever i’m not distracted by something and i have gotten it into my head that i’m literally dying from a heart condition, so much so that i’m going to see my therapist and then a doctor next week. i feel like an idiot for thinking like this since there is no history of heart issues on either side of my family, but i also just need this so that i can calm the hell down. i find myself falling uncharacteristically quiet every once in awhile when i’m focusing on breathing to try to get the pain to go away, but the more i think there’s something wrong with me, the more often the pain comes. i don’t know what to do anymore, this keeps me up at night sometimes and i’ve temporarily cut a lot of social media out of my life so i can focus on myself, but nothing is working and i feel like i’m starting to spiral. if this is just bad anxiety i’ve been thinking about going on medication, but i’ve been overthinking everything so much that i’m not sure of anything anymore...sigh. i’m sorry this got a lot longer than i expected."
2894,Anxiety,I am terrified of looking for work,"I am still in college, my husband has a stable job that more than pays our bills. Since classes have ended the logical next step for most college students is to find employment for the summer or longer. I used to work in the comfortable environment of my University, but I cannot work there over the summer. 
I am terrified of finding other jobs. I am afraid of stressful work conditions, shitty bosses and co-workers, and of generally finding a job I won't enjoy. My last job was a seasonal position at a call center and it triggered so many anxiety attacks. 
I have all these fears compounded by the fear of catching covid. I talked it over with my spouse and I don't need to get a job right now, I can take my time looking for one I really like. 
But this intense fear makes me feel useless. Teenagers do part time work without any issues, why does it terrify Me so much? Having the option to not find work right away and choosing to postpone getting a job also makes me feel extremely guilty and like a privileged snowflake.
Does anyone else have this kind of fear and guilt? Any tips?"
2895,Anxiety,I need help,"18 F 
Last night I realized that my neck hurts really bad when I turn it a certain way and shoulder pain.

I’m so tired of overthinking everything."
2896,Anxiety,"For once, I wish my life was up to me","Hey everyone, 

I posted in here a while back about how I really felt inspired to start fighting my anxiety harder, and a lot has happened since then. I'm transferring to a university in the fall, and I've made a lot of really good progress in my life. But tonight, I just really wanted to rant here, because I don't feel like bothering any of my friends. I started summer classes two weeks ago, and am already falling behind. I'm so upset and angry with myself that my anxiety gets in the way of my life: I just want to go back and shake myself and be like ""why can't you just fucking try harder?"" Now, I have no idea how I'm going to catch up, and I missed so much that I'm going to end up with B instead of an A. I just wish that for once, I could show people how much I care. How much effort I'm putting in, how hard I try, how badly I want to be successful. I wish that I got to feel like the path I was taking in life was mine. I don't know how to fix this feeling that I'm just watching my life happen to me."
2897,Anxiety,Does anyone else get anxious after focusing hard?,"After really getting engrossed in something and losing focus of my body, I feel anxious, and it takes me a little while to feel grounded again. It happens almost every time, and the longer the sessions the stronger that I feel it in the end. Does anyone else get this?"
2898,Anxiety,Chest compressions,I had an experience today that still has me shaken. I had to perform chest compressions today The victim overdosed and she is 100% ok but is on a psych hold. I still feel really freaked out and whenever I'm alone I dwell on it and Idk what to do or think. I feel like im freaking out.
2899,Anxiety,Has this happened to anyone else?,"Has it ever happened to you that you start talking with another person online, everything seems to go well, but around a week or two along the way you realize that it's always you who takes the initiative to start a conversation. It's always you who's asking the questions. It seems as if the other person's contribution to your friendship is minimal.

It's happening with me a lot. I don't really understand, why. Am I doing something wrong? Am I so boring that it's difficult for anyone to want to speak with me? Am I annoying people unintentionally? I'm getting anxious and I feel like it's ruining my self-esteem, since I often consider the state of things to be my fault.

Has it happened to anyone else? And what conclusions did you make from that?"
2900,Anxiety,Almost every night is still a nightmare,"It's my fears that is shaped into my sleeping consciousness and forces me to wake up and panic almost every night. I have nightmares ranging from school to family and other random fears. I'm not in school anymore, but I will be at some point next year or so, and I don't live with my family. Not sure what is triggering these nightmares. I hate that they cloud my mind when I wake up until I get distracted by other tasks. It's bothersome."
2901,Anxiety,Birth control causing anxiety?,"Hi, I was wondering if anyone’s had experience with increased anxiety (or depression) while being on the pill? I’ve been taking birth control for probably around 6-7 years now and have also been diagnosed with anxiety during that time. I believe that I have lived with anxiety all my life but feel that it’s definitely increased at the start of taking the pill. It’s hard to tell if there’s a correlation because it’s also the same time I started college. 

Because of increased anxiety, I started taking Lexapro last year. It’s been the biggest life savior so far. I’m definitely not 100% better, but it’s helped to improve the quality of my life. I can think more clearly, communicate better, and get through each day easier. But besides the fact that life events (ex: getting a full time job) have caused my anxiety to increase, I’m wondering if birth control can also play a part? Basically, I’m considering going off the pill to see if it’d help lessen my anxiety because I still experience mild to moderate anxiety everyday, and I don’t want to have to keep increasing my pill dosage.

I’d appreciate any thoughts or experiences. Thanks in advance!"
2902,Anxiety,Anyone have trouble letting go of people?,"I've suffered from anxiety for literally as long as I can remember.  

Well, my son has disappeared from my life. I've tried numerous times to reach out to him but every attempt goes unanswered.  I know our relationship has never been the greatest but I still don't understand this. 

It has been over a year and I think about him literally every day. I obsess over what I could have done differently and will he ever contact me again.  Now he has moved 8 hours away and I only knew because his sister told me. It breaks my heart."

2905,Anxiety,how do i calm sudden intense bouts of anxiety?,"possible TW!! also slight vent/rant 

i’m not sure if this is the correct sub or not so i’m sorry for that. i’ve dealt with panic attacks since i was about 9 years old i think, so im familiar with what i’m feeling. lately, though, i’ve felt something different. instead of hyperventilating, my vision goes dark and i literally cant breathe, it’s like my throat completely closes and i seem to vibrate? those are the worst ones but are usually built up. i just got back from my parents’ house 900 miles away, which is fine it was just a long drive. i had a coffee at about 6pm but coffee normally doesn’t make me anxious, just jittery. things are weird everywhere right now but the recent events in the US are obviously heightening this as well. i’ve been smoking weed pretty much everyday to curb this feeling which usually works quite well, as i get distracted and my body feels less tense; however, i’m currently out and don’t know when i’m able to get more. i also started to hear things while high last night that scared me?? really bad??? it’s never happened before but it sounded like a woman was screaming and shrieking and yelling “help me” in my head and it really freaked me out. i got higher than i normally have been lately but nothing too over the top. anyway (sorry for rambling) ever since i got back home at about 9pm i feel like a stranger here i’m terrified someone is going to come out of the shadows and hurt me i keep seeing like flashes of a figure behind me i feel like someone is watching me????? i’ve never ever felt like this before i don’t know what happened. i tried taking a hot shower and listening to slow jazz music because i thought that might calm me more than the usual music i listen to. i’ve been trying to get help for years but i’m still a minor and my mom keeps making excuses i feel like i’m actually losing my sanity"
2906,Anxiety,Has anyone taken the Meyers Briggs/16 personalities test online and gotten turbulent as part of their results?,"I took the test recently on 16personalities.com and noticed they added an assertive/turbulent option. I went on other Meyers Briggs subs and people seemed to imply that being turbulent was bad because it meant you weren’t emotionally stable or handled stress well; story of my fucking like lmao. There was a lot of looking down on people who had the turbulent option added onto their personality and results. I could tell my results were based on certain questions like ‘my emotions control me more than I control them’ which I put agree and also ‘if I make a mistake I question my knowledge skills and abilities’ to which I put strongly agree. 

I’m curious if anyone here has taken the personality test and if turbulent is a common high trait in people with anxiety or depression. My personality is INFJ-T btw, and if anyone wants to take the test the link is [here](https://www.16personalities.com)"
2907,Anxiety,How do I overcome the fear of reading anything in general? I tend to panic as I’m reading cause I feel like I’ll end up reading something disturbing eventually.,"For the past couple months. I been finding it very difficult to read anything. It’s causing me major distress cause reading is something I really enjoy doing and the fact that it makes me anxious has me in a bad mood nearly every day. 

I been having this limiting thought, “If you read, you might not be freaked out about what you read at the moment but sooner or later someone will make you extremely anxious and cause you to overthink which could lead you to freak out about something you’ve read in the past” 

This thought has really affected me cause of past experiences with reading and people making me anxious cause of my low self-esteem. Which ironically, I don’t consider my self to have a low self-esteem since I’m actually very confident. But my problem at the moment is that my personality doesn’t suit my body. So what do you mean, it doesn’t suit your body?, you might ask. What I mean is, I have many character traits that many people wish they could have but they don’t and since everyone knows me for being lazy, weak, cold-hearted and a jokester, I feel like they’ll call me fake and try many things to make me upset. But since I’m too weak, physically, I’ll probably get beaten up cause I’m no longer going to stay quiet. I will actually talk back and put my big brain to use. So with all that being said, I feel like sooner or later if I start acting like my true self, people will get jealous and could indeed try to hurt me cause they can’t withstand someone who has acted very stupid trough out his entire life to all of a sudden appear to have all this magical traits. Which in fact, they’ve have always been there but I’ve just been reprimanding my true self due to fear of conflict and being a people pleaser who always tried to kept a cool with people by dumbing myself down to their level. Which in theory, it should work right!?. Well my case was different since I’m too smart to dumb my self down. Instead of behaving like I was at their level, I was acting like I was 4 levels below them. Which caused me to get taken advantage off in multiple different occasions. I got bullied, mistreated, rejected, ignored etc etc ... all trough out my school years. I’m now 22 years old. Not going to college and I’m still traumatized of the past mistreatments repeating them selves again in the future. I have paranoid personality disorder and find it very difficult to relax. I’m constantly double checking sometimes triple, quadruple checking just to make sure no one is outside listening to my words when I talk to myself out-loud. I sometimes tend to say things that I feel like might be perceived as feministic by a grand majority of the male specimen in my family and school counterparts. For example, if I’m reading a book and I come across something loving. More than likely I will say something around these lines “Omg, that is so cute!” out-loud. Soon after I catch my self saying such thing, I start to think “what if my uncle heard me and starts teasing me over what I said” what if he was recording me and uses that recording to blackmail me in the future”, “what if he heard me and calls me gay and truly believes I’m gay and starts telling everyone that I’m gay even though I’m not” I then begin to ruminate over said thing for hours and hours to come. I try to convince myself that he never heard me and that it’s probably all in my mind. 

Here’s a list of some of my most valuable traits which I have yet to shown off to those who knew me when I used to act dumb. Them being my family, and some school junkies who live near me. Well anyhow, here’s the list.

•Kind
•Generous
•Respectful
•Honest
•Helpful  
•Enthusiastic
•Passionate
•Handsome 
•Curious
•Creative
•Caring
•Compassionate
•Bold
•Confident
•Ambiguous
•Energetic
•Cheerful
•Considerate
•Imaginative
•Humorous
•Positive
•Open Minded

Now that I’ve mentioned some of my most introspective character traits, I’m guessing you guys probably have an idea on why it’s so difficult to be myself around those assholes who did me wrong."
2908,Anxiety,Questioning reality a lot,"I’m new to Reddit but I decided to come here for help. I’ll randomly get these moments of questioning reality or random moments where everything seems just.... really really weird.. and it’ll be completely random. Earlier I was talking with my cousin and out of nowhere I started zoning out and rocking back and forth and started questioning reality. But not only that, with the rocking thing, it happens a lot out of nowhere, not really bad but I don’t notice till someone points it out. My thoughts also get out of control sometimes, they will be completely random and repeat itself over and over real loud, but they’re thoughts, I don’t actually hear it. Like “buzz chick lick dopple dopple doppledoppleDOPPLE!!”"
2909,Anxiety,I feel like a shitty mom.,I know my period is coming within the next week or so (sorry tmi) so that might be why in feeling this way. I lost my patience today and yelled at my toddler. I was very frustrated to the point where I was sweating. He was safe in his crib but I still yelled at him to shut up. Now im laying in the dark feeling like shit wanting to hold him. I also want to get off Facebook because everything that’s going on is just so sad and stressful. I would love to go to one of the protests but I’m stuck at home alone with the baby every single day. Sometimes I feel myself going crazy. I sometimes say it out loud. ( IN SPIRALING DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE!!!!) I can feel it. My thoughts start going crazy and I start feeling guilty and feeling like a piece of shit. Maybe it’s my hormones or maybe I am just a piece of shit. Either way I failed as a mom today. My child is supposed to feel safe when he’s with me. I literally walked away when he reached out for me because I was so upset. Sometimes I wish it would be better if I never brought an innocent child into this world. My dad disappointed me so much and I don’t want to be the same for him. He’s going to know who I am one day and I won’t be his hero anymore. I don’t know. I just feel like shit and don’t want to be here right now.
2910,Anxiety,Overwhelming sadness,"My mom (77) had a bile duct obstruction and was very ill and hospitalized for 14 days. In those 14 days she was completely bedridden. When she finally came home, she was making slow progress. About a week later, she stopped eating and drinking. She has lost weight (on an already tiny frame) and has become very weak.

Her primary doctor ran bloodwork and all her labs are better than when she was admitted. I just don’t understand. By all accounts she should be getting better, but it’s like a light has switched off and we are on a downward spiral. She sleeps 20 hours a day.

She refuses to eat and drink. She refuses to go to the hospital. She refuses to let me have a visiting nurse come. She refuses to let me call an ambulance. I feel like I am just watching her die. She is not in great health, but she also doesn’t have a terminal condition. I don’t understand what is happening.

She has been home 15 days. How could things have gone so terribly wrong in 15 days. I just don’t know what to do. I am so sad and so stressed."
2911,Anxiety,my friend just left me because they needed space to help themselves.,"my friend has been distant this past week, and i was making sure to check on them to make sure everything was alright, as i know they struggle mentally just like i do with my extreme anxiety. they always said everything was fine. i was worrying so much over it, because they were just acting completely different than usual. i tried to not text them as much if they left me on read, and try not to bother them as it seemed they didn’t want to talk. tonight, they just told me that they needed to leave me, and not talk anymore to help themselves. i understand, and all i want for them is to be happy. i don’t want to seem selfish, and i don’t want to keep them from doing what they need to do. it’s just so hard, when i constantly worry about them and our friendship. i am not sure what to do. i plan to give them the space they want, and not talk to them until they are ready. it just hit so hard for me, and i just wasn’t expecting them to leave like this. i feel like i am just an anxious mess right now. any advice?"
2912,Anxiety,How do I eat a popsicle in front of people?,"I know this is a dumb question to ask. It probably seems as if I'm trolling, but I promise I'm not.

I have a lot of anxiety surrounding eating in front of people. Scared they might judge me for the way I chew or the way I look at my food or the size of the bite I took. I've learned ways to eat other foods, like hamburgers, for example. ""Take small bites, don't look at it too much while you're eating; you might seem like a glutton."" That's what I tell myself. But how the fuck do you eat a popsicle without it being weird?

I'm talking about [these types of popsicles,](https://www.realfoodwithjessica.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/PaleoVegan2IngredientPopsicles4.jpg) the ones that are rectangular. Do you put your entire mouth around the top (yes, this could be taken out of context as something very sexual so I'm sorry)? Do you just lick until it's smaller? When do I bite it?

This 100% isn't a troll, but also I know this is so random and dumb and I'm sorry if I'm wasting anyone's time. I just really really don't know how to eat a popsicle in public :("
2913,Anxiety,I think it’s time to try medication. I’m scared. Hoping to hear your experiences.,"I have had different types of anxiety and mental health disorders for years. I’ve been pushed to try anxiety medication by doctors since I was a teen (I’m 27). My brain is only getting worse. I do not use any drugs or alcohol. My mom was addicted to pills my whole childhood and died of prescription overdose when I was 14 and I have refused prescriptions since then. I didn’t even take painkillers for my c-section.
My anxiety and etc is getting worse, to the point where I have a hard time enjoying simple activities with my daughter like trying to play outside because my brain is a constant spiral of “what can go wrong”. I’m so tired of my brain being so negative and dark when I just want to make my brain calm down for one minute.
I’m considering trying medication but I’m terrified.
1 - I’m scared it will change my personality and that my daughter will grow up knowing a different, medicated, version of me.
2 - I’m scared I will not be able to cope without it in the event I have to stop taking it
3 - I’m scared i won’t know how different I am while taking it. 

I’m really not trying to be offensive so I’m sorry if I am, but I’m really hoping to get some perspective and experience stories from people who have tried medication.

(No, CBD is not an option.)"
2914,Anxiety,Heartburn makes me anxious,Lately I’ve been controlling my anxiety pretty well if I feel it coming on I start grounding myself etc. But the one thing that really catches me out is if I have heartburn i feel like I get super anxious!! Which probably in turns make the heartburn worse. I suffer from GERD but was wondering if anyone else gets like that?
2915,Anxiety,My panic attacks started again and i cant calm myself down,"I used to be on medication for panic attacks but i stoppee because i felt in control but recently college just started. Ive found myself unable to eat thinking about assignments tonight i found myself unable to find motivation and was sweating like crazy. I stood in front of the fan and an ant climbed up my leg and it freaked me out causing me to feel bugs all over me and really not able to calm down. My mom came in tried to defuse and it helped but i realized the time (almost 3am) caused me to panic again afraid of not having enough time to finish tomorrow and she basically walked out on me saying ""youre not 12 any more"" and shit. I get shes tired and just wants to sleep but i guess i needed someone to comfort me, but everything she said that was positive just made a thought of ""no youre childish, no youre not pretty you have just sweat buckets and you hairs wet from it"" instead of just taking the damn compliment. She got super upset i couldnt let it go and spent a while just laying down outside alone in the backyard at 3am it helped, but i just wish i wasnt so childish. 

I just want calm, cool and collected but im everything but. Idk if this is the best place to ask this sort of stuff but, have any of you had to learn to calm yourself down alone and if you have any advice.

Also im not here to complain about my mom she did her best and i knew it would have helped if positive comments didnt irrate me when im upset. Have any of you felt that before? Can i just get a grip of myself no medicine has worked so far and i dont know if im bad at communicating symptoms but my counselor never fully understood what i was trying to say same with my doctor. I dont know."
2916,Anxiety,Feel like such a failure,"So me and my husband bought a house and it’s being completely redone. It has taken us a year and it’s finally starting to come toward the end and in good time due to me also being pregnant with our first child. But what I thought would be a fun task, going and shopping for paint, lights, furniture ect isn’t. I can’t bring myself to go to the store without completely panicking. I will get to the store and not be able to get out of my car cause my chest will get tight, arms weak heart beating fast. I feel like such a freak and a failure. I’m 22 but can’t go into a store it’s pathetic. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore."
2917,Anxiety,Reminder to please take care of yourselves and pay attention to your triggers and especially to your limits.,"Hi all, 

Please remember to take care of yourselves and be mindful of your limits. I had been feeling a bad meltdown coming on for a few weeks and I learned the hard way today that I should not have ignored my body asking for what it needed. I ended up at the hospital tonight where they very kindly gave me fluids and rescue medication until I could breathe well, but I should have never let it get that bad. 

I am feeling better now, and I am here to remind you that taking care of yourself is the most important thing you can do. There is no shame in needing medicine. Listen to your body. Breathe. Your health comes first."
2918,Anxiety,Insomniac that has night terrors. DAE experience this? What can I do to stop them?,"I have a fair share of childhood trauma and at a young age began having night terrors that ended in me waking up screaming. I developed insomnia that I haven't been able to shake since because I was scared to fall asleep. If I take melatonin or a sleeping aid, it just interrupts my sleep and makes my dreams disturbing. 

Eventually, I got the night terrors under control somehow to the point where I no longer scream, but I often silently cry or hyperventilate. I don't experience them nearly as often as I did when I was a kid, but when I do, they're still pretty severe. Sometimes they spiral into panic attacks. 

I can get the night terrors mostly under control to where they become a rare occurrence, and I actually haven’t had them more then once quarterly for a while. But, the last couple of months have not been great in terms of my anxiety levels and they’re flaring up again. I want to get better and sleep normal, consistently. Not just when my body’s had enough. I know the long term effects of sleeping habits like these can’t be good. 

I'm not really sure what this is, but nonetheless, I'm tired. I love enjoying waking up early and enjoying sleep but neither are really possible all the time. Even when I don't have night terrors, I usually have nightmares if I dream. They are usually pretty disturbing and realistic and leave me shaken up for a while after. 

I meditate, I run long distance - sometimes twice a day - I read before bed and stay off my devices but once they start I genuinely get scared to fall asleep again. 

Does anyone else experience this?"
2919,Anxiety,my life feels pointless,"i'm 19. i graduated HS a year ago. all of my friends went into post secondary soon after and they tease me about how i'm not in school. i know it's a joke but, it still hurts. so badly. i don't think i'm going into school until a year from now, maybe not even then, and i feel absolutely inferior. i'm scared i'm going nowhere.
my family doesn't notice how sad i am all the time. they pass off me not eating, not being happy, not having energy, not speaking, not cleaning as me just being a lazy teen. i barely leave my room. i sleep all day and stay awake at night. even then, i cry until i can sleep some more. sometimes the only way i can sleep at proper times is if i cry hard enough or drink hard enough. i don't talk/text anyone often anymore because it feels like i'm such a bother to them all. i just want to be absorbed by the earth and watch everyone from a distance. does that even make sense..? i don't know anymore. i don't know what i'm doing with myself. there's so many things i want in life but it's like there's chains around my throat and my arms and legs that keep me from achieving it. i'm so full of sadness. i'm always thinking: what if everyone leaves? what if i go nowhere? what if i can never be happy? what if i can never reach any goals? what if i can never be better? there's so many negative possibilities to my life and im so scared. it lingers in the back of my mind every day and i hate it so much. i hate it. i can't stop crying. 

i'm so sorry for this rant, if it seems repetitive or anything. i don't mean to be so negative. i just can't go anywhere else. i just feel so trapped. i feel so alone."

2921,Anxiety,I need help disconnecting from the news.,"After reading a bunch of articles about the pandemic, protests/riots, and other global stuff I always get anxious and panicky. But the problem is I just can't seem to stop looking for triggering articles.

Anytime I try to disconnect from reading the news online, I feel like I'm missing something important, like a big news story just happened and I didn't know about it, not knowing stuff like that bothers me for some reason.

I don't known if I'm just trying to get myself to panic or if it's something else, but it's draining catching myself going to /r/worldnews or Twitter for the 3rd time in an hour.

If I see any article relating to climate change or anything that may have an affect in the future, my brain just spirals into this catastrophic, apocalyptic thought spiral that is really hard to get out of."

My mind is thinking beyond the limits of what would happen in the future. My city is in the phase of recovering to the new normal. We know this pandemic will not eradicate quickly and I also think our local government is hiding the actual cases. It's halfway 2020 and I'm still afraid of this year can give to us."

Am I scared that I'm still alone? Day in, day out? An I scared that my only friend will stop wanting to talk to me? Am I scared that I can never be my true self? Never be able to use my voice, because I'm scared of the consequences and because I'll never have a platform? Am I scared that I'll always be pushing people away, because I care about relationships too much? Am I scared that the world is going to change? Or worse, that it's not going to change? 

An I scared I'll never find love? I think I'm scared I'll never find love..."
2925,Anxiety,Quarantine and losing touch with friends,"Finally got to see two of my best friends that I've known for the past 6 years and have helped me get through this last few weeks of high school now. I was super excited about seeing them but they almost seemed like they didn't care. And very fast my mind went from excited about seeing them to ""holy shit I'm such a prick for inconveniencing them like this so I can see then when I'm not even sure they want to see me"". I have always felt like I was slowly slipping away from them but now it's been faster and more apparent. Honestly, I've always felt like a burden to them. Like I'm holding them back or something like that."
2926,Anxiety,Social media toxicity,"Hi all. I hope you are safe and doing well. I would just like to vent. I am suffering from extreme anxiety. 8 years ago when I was diagnosed with depression and ptd. So from then, I am trying to help myself cope. I rarely open up my social media accounts because of what's currently going on in our country  (PH). Government is consistently making clown shows and their puppets are making fake accounts of legit person and will post something stupud and will send it to the authority so that person/people will be red tagged and be arrested. and so troll accounts to bully those who are opposing them. My mental health is currently suffering not to mention, I lost my job due to covid.

I feel like I keep on making bad decisions like a month ago, I decided to buy a nintendo switch so I could have something to do. Because I don't want to suffer from another episode as I have nothing with me anymore. anyway, Little did I know that you need to buy the game of switch. So I have a switch with no game. Used my savings to buy it.

Hope you guys are fine.

thank you for letting me to vent."
2927,Anxiety,"How can I get my mom to understand my issues, without sounding like an asshole?","My mom doesn't really understand why I panic. She gets upset when I do. She doesn't mean to, but she does. 

Everytime I try to explain what's going on in my head she goes back to the same rhetoric of ""use your coping mechanisms, talk to your therapist, stop freaking out over every little thing"" and I appreciate it, I really do. But none of it is truly helpful. 

She's been trying to push me out of my comfort zone, and if it were baby steps I would enjoy it more, but these haven't been baby steps. 

We're going to a spa tomorrow, I've gotten zero sleep, and the idea of people touching me right now has made me go into a panic attack. If I tell my mom she's gonna get upset because ""I'm doomsdaying"" over getting sick. I'm not anymore, I just don't like being close to people. It took me forever to get used to my boyfriend touching me. I hate *doctors* touching me, what makes you think I want a total stranger touching any part of me?? 

Tl;Dr I word things awfully during my anxiety attacks and it's causing a shift in my mom and I's relationship, and idk how to word stuff better. Any help?"
2928,Anxiety,Moved to London from New York 1 month before lockdown. Feeling totally alone and really far away from the people I love...,"I moved to London in February for an indefinite job relocation. It seemed like a great opportunity when I got the job promotion, so I picked up and moved by myself to the uk.

My family lives in California, and all of my friends are in nyc. I know people are in isolation in those places too and can’t really see each other, but they can still stop by each other’s apartments and say hello through the window - or go for a distanced walk at the park to at least have some sort of interaction. As things open up, I think this is going to being harder and harder and my homesickness will get stronger.

In London things have already started to relax, and it hurts to see everyone at the park with their friends when I have no one to call at all. Right now is also an impossible time to meet new people, because people’s social circles are restricted and they are prioritizing the most important people in their lives (aka no the new girl).

I also found out this week that our office has closed down indefinitely, so I won’t be able to make friends with the colleagues I was starting to build relationships with during my first month in the office.

I am making it through one day at a time, but each day it gets more difficult. This will likely be my reality for all of 2020 and maybe beyond, depending how things go... it feels impossible and I’m not sure how I’m going to make it through.

Any guidance or ideas about how to cope would be so helpful. I just feel so alone in this situation and I can’t really relate to anyone about this strange spot I’m in..."
2929,Anxiety,Did I have a panic attack or a stroke?,"So yesterday I had a pretty bad depressive/anxiety episode, followed by a very manic episode where I felt almost good and normal and was laughing about.

Then I went to bed and I kinda got this sudden very brief spinning sensation in my head. As I tried falling asleep I got this feeling like I can't breathe suddenly. My heartrate skyrocketed, I began sweating and suddenly I felt very different? Odd? Detached? The room felt different and everything was scary. I was scared I will die. I felt nauseous and like I will vomit. My breathing was very labored and my chest felt so tight it almost hurt.

I got up and felt like my legs are cut off. My arms felt weak and clumsy but I didn't have any trouble opening my Xanax and taking one. It was weird like I could do everything but it all felt strange at the same time, like numb and almost like I wasn't doing it. I texted my friend to comfort me and in about an hour I was calmer and fell asleep. I woke up from sleep few times with a similar feeling and it now subsides slowly. It's just this weird feeling and if I think about last night I get overwhelming panic again.

Was this a panic attack? I know none of us are doctors but I wouldn't wanna go to the ER during COVID over nothing especially since few people from the staff got infected there the other day."
2930,Anxiety,I want to stop over analysing. I’m 14 any tips?,"How Do I Stop Over-Analysing? I’m 14

I’m 14 and I have a problem with over analysing everything. Like if someone says something in a weird way I just think about it for ages, or if someone looks at me weird I’ll think about it for long but also just be cautious of them.there has been an instance where it’s saved me I guess. I got into a taxi that my mum called for me (I had to travel alone in it to school) and the driver didn’t say anything as I got in, just stared at me for 5 seconds through the mirror and started driving. I took this as a red flag and looked around the car. At the passenger seat (the front one next to the driver) there was a pole like thing and rope... I grabbed the pole then realised it was a crowbar. He had locked the doors so I opened it with the crowbar from the inside (it was one of them old fashioned locks that open from the inside) and I just jumped out. He stopped the car immediately and got out then chased me for a while. I lost him and ran to a store where I told them and they didn’t believe me... I told my mum and she told the police but they searched for the drivers name (mr johnston) and it wasn’t registered with the cab company. I was confused af and my mum didn’t seem to believe it either (even though I had a cut on my knee from landing on  concrete after jumping out of a moving car). But anyways that’s an experience where over analysing has ‘saved’ me I guess. Any way to stop over analysing btw?"
2931,Anxiety,Does anyone elses panic/anxiety predominantly relate to other people being ill?,"So I've noticed I am constantly petrified about the people around me being ill. For example my mum feels a bit dizzy/headachey right now and I literally feel in full panic - I convince myself it's something awful and she's going to collapse or keel over. My boyfriend had a migraine and threw up a few months ago and I was crying and shaking and couldn't cope and thought he was going to die. My sister had period pains last week and I was terrified it was something more.

If anyone is ill or feels ill I just completely panic that they're going to die, and I just can't cope.

I've also convinced myself that it's likely that everyone around me will die young. It's probably worth mentioning that my dad has been diagnosed with incurable cancer and I think this has hugely amplified my fears. The coronavirus situation isn't helping either. 

I know I need to get some therapy, I just needed to get that off my chest and see if anyone else suffers with this."
2932,Anxiety,You are worth it,"So, I am just here to share my experience that things can get better.
I was an agoraphobic for over 10 years due to anxiety. I avoided crowds, lines of any kind, public transport ect...basically over time I avoided everything. I thought there was no way out of this and no-one would understand (most didn't), It took a long time for me realise I was as good, if not better than than those I feared. I hope you can realise this one day too."
2933,Anxiety,Self talk in times of anxiety.,"I've noticed my anxiety gets really bad in times of isolation and negative self talk.  These last weeks I've been somewhat isolated because of social distancing.  However, I've also noticed that I've been really been engaging in a lot of negative self talk.  A lot of it has to do with the fact that I feel like I'm getting old and I really don't know where I'm going in the future.  (I'm wanting to do a career change, but I don't know where I'm going to go in the future.) and I don't have many close friends. Then my self talk takes over saying that I'm weak for still having this anxiety and there's nothing I can do to change anything.  The problem is that the feelings feel really real because my anxiety is so physical.  How can I calm myself down in the midst of this and counter my self talk?"
2934,Anxiety,Needs to be said.,"You know what I don’t understand. You see a therapist for a year because you need Help with how to handle yourself you ADHD, PTSD , your anxiety, how to minimise the amount of anxiety attacks you have, to grow forward as a person and to have someone who you trust to talk to about anything. Then the therapist you’ve been seeing leaves that job for her own reasons.

 so for 6 months you decide you don’t want to open up to someone knew because that seems scary. But then you get to a point where you feel so low and that you need help so you give the CAFS  office a call and tell them you need help. You want help. You reach out. And they check your  files and literally say “because you’re 18 and an adult now, living with your partner and working full time you don’t reach the standards to see a therapist” 
How the fuck is that allowed. They’re supposed to be there to help you when you reach out for it. 

Child adolescent family services.

Being 18 living with my partner with a full time job doesn’t exactly make it any easier to handle myself or my anxiety or adhd or ptsd.
What does that have to do with anything. Over 85 suicides in New Zealand this year alone. And this is part of the reason. The people who gather the strength to actually identify the fact they need help and spend 2 hours holding the phone with the number on speed dial until they pull them self to together to push call. To then open up about why they want help say everything that’s happens and is happening completely stepping out of your comfort zone to then get told they can’t help you? 

Complete bullshit.

Yes I’m going through shit and yes I feel my lowest but to anyone who feels the same, I’m fucking here for you man I don’t care who you are.

I can’t say I can help you or give good advice but I can tell you that I will listen and give my opinion or I will sit down and have a coffee while you rant about your problems and then we can go for a walk and change the subject. I am there for every single one of you who feel the way I do. 

The thought that there were over 85 people in the last 6 months who felt they had no one. The thought of my own friend up there in heaven because she felt alone. The thought of myself maybe reaching that point or anyone else I care about. It kills me.
  

I am here, even when you feel you have no one. If you’ve never even spoken to me. I am here to listen to your struggles to try help and guide you to the best of my ability and potentially grow from it myself. 

No one should be sitting in their bed crying them self to sleep because they feel they aren’t good enough.

NO ONE"
2935,Anxiety,Worried about giving coronavirus to my parents,"I know I might get a bit of judgement on this, but I saw my parents for the first time yesterday since covid lockdowns started in March. I’m extremely close to my family, and before this my boyfriend and I used to see them every weekend so it’s taken a lot of restraint not to see them for this long and had taken a toll on my mental health.

We bought a house right before lockdowns started and are moving next week, and we needed to buy a car (moving from downtown to the suburbs), so my dad came to help us negotiate since we’re first-time car buyers. Afterwards, he invited us to social distance in their backyard with some drinks, but then it started pouring rain so we had to go inside. We tried to keep our distance as much as possible and I never hugged them or anything, but at some points we were sitting quite close to them.

My dad has an autoimmune disease and my mom is fairly healthy, but both are 60 years old so at an at-risk age. Right now the government in my province is allowing groups of 5 people from 2 different households to get together, so technically what we did wasn’t “wrong” but we didn’t social distance properly. I work from home but my boyfriend works with the public, so I’m constantly worried that he’s going to bring covid home (on top of worrying about my parents contracting it). Now I know that I’m going to be paranoid for the next 14 days, calling my parents up often to ask if everyone feels ok. I’m just feeling really awful and anxious this morning that I should have been more careful, but it’s been so incredibly hard to stay away from my parents until this point. I just can’t stop crying. This was also the first time I’d seen anyone in person since March; I haven’t seen any of my friends either, even from a distance.

TLDR; I saw my parents over the weekend and we didn’t social distance very well, and now I’m afraid my boyfriend or I may be asymptotic and given covid to my parents."

2937,Anxiety,Concentration Meditation app to help you relax/sleep,"I created a website (see link) to help people RELAX. The website allows users to practice concentration meditation by focusing on nothing but the dot/spot. Users can change the speed, size, colour of the dot/spot and the size of the area that the dot moves in. Choose whatever is best for your focus. Then just stare at the dot, try not to blink for as long as possible and any random thoughts you have just ignore/let them pass by and go back to concentrating on the dot. I recommend doing it for around 5-10 minutes at first and then if you want try to increase the duration. I find 15 minutes is good for me. I have found this a good meditation that allows me to relax, and if I do it before bedtime I find it makes it easier for me to fall asleep. Anyway, my website is,

My brain somehow managed to totally blend out the “I still love you” and just focuses on the “annoying” part since then. I don’t know what it is, but I really don’t wanna annoy them, so I’d change it, but then again wouldn’t that be annoying as well?

2948,Anxiety,Starting to realize certain friendships are making me feel worse.,"Title says it all. Before anyone says I’m being selfish bc we are all dealing with the current social / political climate differently - this has been a year plus in the making. 
Someone I’ve treated like family and genuinely care for as an extension of my family has started to act as though I am an annoyance or an inconvenience. No one is perfect but I have reflected with my husband and cannot find where I’ve done anything blatantly annoying or disrespectful. I am realizing that it’s all been Lip Service and a friendship that serves as an ego stroke. 
I am heart broken but I cannot let this drain on me anymore. This has instigated strong thoughts of self doubt and loneliness and inadequacy. Then I spiral bc I become embarrassed that I let anyone feel any kind of way. I have an amazing partner and child so I’m ashamed that I’ve let anyone make me feel this way but I cannot help it. 
I don’t even want to put the energy into officially cutting ties but I have decided to distance myself from this friend for a while. I understand that I am not “owed” anything but I’m tired of feeling like I pour myself into all of my relationships just for people like this friend to treat me like I’m disposable."
2949,Anxiety,Is your anxiety of phone calls and FaceTime ruining long distance friendships?,"So I graduated from college two years ago and moved to a different state where not a single one of my college friends lives.  I have group chats with some of them where we text in it pretty regularly, but I have some friends who are not.

Although I have a couple of friends who fall into this category, I have one really good friend called E, that prompted me to post this.  We were like soulmate best friends, we unfortunately met the last year of college and we were soooooo close.  Originally when I moved, she would often call me or FaceTime me and I would almost always ignore it..... I have anxiety (not like debilitating, but I’m prescribed anti anxiety meds and Xanax) but I HATE phone calls/FaceTime.  I literally can only call my family, other than that I almost never use the phone.  Even calling customer support gives me panic.

So now E has stopped trying and although we text sometimes, I feel our friendship is disappearing which I really don’t want to happen.

Does anyone have advice on what to do?  I know I should just call but for some reason that makes me literally sick to my stomach.  And this is a widespread problem, it’s making it difficult to really keep any friends that I don’t live close to.  Plus I feel bad knowing I’m being a really bad friend :(

Tl;dr My anxiety over calls and FaceTimes is ruining friendships"
2950,Anxiety,I’m In Love,"I’m in love and have been for the past 3.5 years. Anxiety has had ahold of me for the past 10+ years. I’ve had depression since I was 10 or 11, I’m a 32F.

I’m in love and it scares me to death constantly. I’ve been dating my partner I’m in love with on and off for the past 3.5 years. On and off because I constantly burn the relationship down to the ground.

Because of genetics and my childhood depression and anxiety is a daily struggle. I started talk therapy at 18 and was put on medication. In the past couple of years I’ve done DBT and EMDR therapy. Currently I’m not in therapy and I take St. John’s Wort to try and balance out my mood.

Weekly I have overwhelming fears that my partner will cheat on me. Sometimes it’s passing suspensions, other times it’s close to panic attack levels. I vocally accuse my partner of cheating and doubt his love for me to him. I become mean and ugly and tell him I want to break up. The fight or flight comes to me.

This hurts him terribly.

I start to dissociate. I become cold and his face becomes unfamiliar to me. I make him an enemy in my mind. I look at his face and know this is the person I loved just yesterday, but today he has caused me pain and he is nearly a stranger. But he didn’t cause me pain, I inflicted emotional pain on myself.

I was married before. I gave birth to our baby and 4 months later my ex-husband never came home one night. We argued that weekend and he decided he didn’t love me anymore and immediately moved in with another woman. Leaving me with our 4 month old girl, no job, and no money. He came back around 2 months later deciding it was a big mistake. We divorced a few years later because of this and because he physically beat me a couple times.

I’m in love with an emotionally strong and intelligent man that is sweet, caring, and tender. He challenges me to be a better person, to be stronger, to not retreat or make excuses for my behavior that comes from my depression and anxiety.

I want to marry this person.

I can’t marry this person, yet, because he wants me to overcome the ugliness from the battles I cause or at the very least work harder to understand them and apologize for what I’ve done.

I don’t know what to do when that thought arises that he’ll cheat, he’ll find someone else, he doesn’t really love me. The thought I should get out now because I can’t handle a relationship, that we’d be better off separated. The thought that I’d be better off alone. These thoughts take over my brain and body, they cause me to be uncomfortable in my own skin, feelings that I’m going to die if this isn’t taken cared of immediately.

Has anyone else had to battle themselves to stay in a relationship with a partner they love and want to spend the rest of their life with, but constantly find themselves tearing away?

This is painful. I’m fruitful in all other aspects of my life. I want to get married. I don’t want to burn my relationship down to the ground. Has anyone successfully overcome this or found a way to better manage feelings such as these?"
2951,Anxiety,Valerian root,"So this week was my first time using the capsules. I really do like them and it helps take the edge off....but for some reason it seems to take at least two hours to kick in. I know everyone’s body is different, but is this normal? Is there anything i can do or take to make it work faster?"
2952,Anxiety,Im having a mental breakdown and no one is taking me seriously!,"They all think Im joking, they tell me that Im mean and selfish. I want to kill myself. My father even joked about lebotomizing me!"
2953,Anxiety,Poking and picking at my anxiety triggers like a scab,"I have some specific triggers that are both internal and external, and I can very easily slip down a spiral of having a mildly triggering thought and I'll feel strangely compelled to keep seeking out exposure to the trigger, scratching that wound and triggering myself more in the process until I've ruined my day and I'm miserable and in a terrible anxiety loop.

Being on SSRIs has made these spirals much shorter and milder, but once in a while a sneaky thought will send me down that path anyway. I know it's bad for me, but I feel an urge to keep staring into the triggering abyss and I don't understand why I do this to myself. I guess it might be a type of messed up misguided habituation or an attempt to resolve the anxiety by confronting it, but time and time again I return to it as if I'm going to glean something new from scratching that same exact scab. It's like I get a sudden ""What if it's gotten worse while I haven't been looking at it"", even though it's always the same.

I know I'm not alone in being stuck in this behavioural loop and have talked to a therapist about it. It's really hard to balance not being avoidant and not pointlessly triggering myself when there's nothing new for me to learn from it.

Have you folks dealt with this, and how? Do I need to instead habituate to not reacting to the triggering thought? When the thought emerges, not following the anxious breadcrumb trail feels intolerable, almost worse than the self-triggering."
2954,Anxiety,Anxiety when driving,"I’m 23 and still have so much anxiety about driving. It’s such a problem that it causes me to shake anytime I think about having to get behind the wheel. The thing is I can go ahead and do the driving, not too good but ok, but I have not gone out on the road with other cars. The thought alone makes me want to vomit. I need to get my DL soon and I don’t know to get over this fear . Anyone else overcome this issue??"
2955,Anxiety,When did you know it was time to ask for help?,"I’m a male, 28. I’ve always had mild anxiety but have always been able to manage it pretty well. Late last year, I started experiencing lightheadedness, chest pains, reflux, digestive issues and fatigue. Then I found myself constantly worried about what was wrong with me, which I think made me feel even worse. I was hyper focused on how I was feeling every second. I ended up going to the ER one morning when my symptoms were at their worst. They did 2 EKGs and a chest x ray and monitored me for about 3 hours. The doctor said everything looked 100% normal and that it was most likely due to stress. This made sense to me because it was the week after Christmas (we have a big family so we were constantly on the go, visiting relatives that whole week) and my wife was also 8 months pregnant at the time, so we were about a month away from a big change in lives with our first baby. So after the visit the ER, I started feeling a little better each day. I think having all the tests done put my mind at ease and allowed me relax a little. About 3 weeks later, I felt totally normal. Not sure if it’s because the baby came so I had a ton of other stuff on my mind and couldn’t focus on how I was feeling, or what?

I went about 4 months feeling totally fine. I didn’t experience any of the symptoms I was feeling back in January. Then all of sudden out of nowhere they all came back at the end of May. This time I’m thinking it’s because I’ve had a ton of changes happen at work due to the pandemic. In the past 2 months they’ve bounced me around and I’ve had literally 5 different job titles. There’s been constant change and I haven’t been able to get into a solid routine and I believe that’s stressed me out. I’m thinking this is my body telling me I need to take it easy. But I’m also wondering if big life changes are a trigger that gives me really bad anxiety? 

Focusing on other task seem to make me feel better. Like yard work or cooking or playing guitar. But when I’m just siting there watching TV or driving to work I hyper focus on how I feel and it makes me feel worse. Exercise seems to help a lot also... but they’re only temporary fixes. This isn’t affecting my quality of life yet. But I’m worried it could in the future if it gets any worse. 

Just wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this and if they’ve gotten professional help or gotten through it on their own. Thanks I’m advance!"
2956,Anxiety,how to control the physical effects of anxiety?,"Today I am happy, after a long time.  This afternoon I am going to see some people that I have not seen for a long time, so it is normal that I feel more anxious or nervous, but damn.  I mean, mentally I feel good, I want to see them and I don't know, I really want to live today (and it is strange for me to want to ""live""). But physically I have all the symptoms of anxiety and I can't take it anymore. You know what?  I had been bad, depressed, sad for a long time (I still am but the road begins to light up) and a few days ago I began to feel ""happiness"" but I have realized that, however happy I am, I still feel that ""physical"" anxiety  and I'm fed up.  What do you do when you are happy and still feel anxiety? Because today I'm happy but I still feel dizziness, nausea, cold sweats, heat from some parts of the body, chills, even a little desire to self-harm and shortness of breath. What can I do?"

My symptom is that when I’m somewhere like the bath and  chest is bent a bit (it’s very rare it happens) but I get a sharp stabbing pain in my ribs / heart and I have to straighten my posture then it usually goes. It full goes after a couple minutes. Is this a muscular thing ? has anyone else experience this ? Any advice would be great ! Thank you in advance 

I must add that last year this would give me the biggest panic attack ever u his year it hasn’t bothered me only a tiny tiny bit just because I don’t know what it is ! So that’s a win ! Thank you guys"
2962,Anxiety,I am anxious about returning back to my pre lockdown routine.,"Things that make me anxious are thinking of going back to office, constant interaction with fellow employees, friends, and hanging out with them. I have become accustomed and leant to love this slow paced lifestyle I have adopted in this lockdown, primarily because it allows me to give time to myself (and I have learnt so many new things about myself coz of that). I fear going back to that fast paced lifestyle post lockdown and losing all these things which I loved doing. Also, I fear this lockdown is turning me back into that severely introverted kid I was while growing up, who hated talking to people, and had a lot of social anxiety."
2963,Anxiety,"Anxiety, Sweat, and Smell?","Was wondering if anyone has a similar problem. When I get stressed/anxiety I start to feel like my skin is burning. It's like a pins and needles pain in a way along with my skin feeling warm/hot. It doesn't usually last but it sort of flashes, the feeling usually emanates from my chest and moves down my arms and legs. When this happens I usually start to sweat profusely. I can then usually feel heat being removed from my body, as what sweating is suppose to do I guess. I sweat so much my pants and shirt usually become drenched in sweat. I don't smell anything but by other people's reactions and comments it must smell pretty bad when this happens. I'm sure if the anxiety is causing some sort of distress reaction and I become a skunk in a way, or if it is because of the sweat even though I pack on deodorant.

I went to visit a family member recently, I was doing fine, then I saw someone scratch them nose and that was enough to trigger an anxiety attack. I had everything happen as explained above. As soon as it did they started using their hair as a mask for their nose. So yah. 

I don't look forward to going back to work. It is just constant daily harassment. That harassment just leads to me having more anxiety and making the problem worse which just leads to more harassment, and the cycle continues.

I have hyperhidrosis so I do sweat a lot when I don't have anxiety anyways. I have taken prescriptions that are suppose to reduce sweating. They make the pins, needle, and hot feeling I get with anxiety not as intense. And I don't sweat as much when it happens, but I still get the feeling, still sweat, and obviously still smell.

Society has made it ok to make fun of people that smell, I wish the solution was as simple as simply taking a shower. I take two a day cause I sweat so much even when I'm not active while asleep. But the situation is much more complicated than that. I hate it. I'm going to miss quarantine where I don't have to deal with daily harassment.

Thanks for reading."

2966,Anxiety,Breathing Exercises and CBT Methods that Changed my Life,"Hey guys, 

I had extreme anxiety that was debilitating and I'm now leading a life that is absolutely manageable. I have been doing breathing exercises that I found on this guy [Luke Horton's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAc9_Ug_adJvcKJhAIUqhIQ/featured). He doesn't have many subscribers or views and I don't know why because it was an absolute game changer for me. I would say start with the guided breathing exercises but he also has great videos that explain CBT and make life with anxiety much easier to understand. You can explore the channel and find out what helps you. 

He also has breathing exercises here: [https://www.headfulness.com/breathing-exercise-library-1](https://www.headfulness.com/breathing-exercise-library-1). I was reluctant to buy them but they were only 7 dollars and I'm glad I did. I mostly just bought them to support Luke because his videos have helped me so much.  

I just wanted to pass a long this tool because it has helped me so much and I know there are many people still suffering. My life is not perfect but it has improved dramatically. 

Take what works and leave the rest. 

Have a good day!"
2967,Anxiety,My anxiety is stopping me from getting out of my house to take a walk in a park near my house. I haven't stepped out of my house for 3 days. I don't know how to get myself out of my house.,
2968,Anxiety,Constant war in my own head,"I go through all this anytime i try to speak to anybody. I can’t make friends easily because of it and i don’t talk to my family much because of it. Everytime i talk to someone, I feel like I’m saying the wrong things. Every time I talk it feels like I’m picking the wrong dialogue in a video game. To deal with it, I usually try to limit how much I’m talking and let the other person take over the conversation but I look them in the eye and nod and smile to let them know I am engaged. But if I’m getting really overwhelmed and I start to feel like I’m bombing it I will wrap the conversation up ASAP and find any reason to walk away and go to a bathroom, my car, anywhere I can be by myself and calm down. I HATE when multiple people are trying to talk to me or get my attention or when there’s too many different things going on at once, it literally makes me feel like I’m going fucking crazy. I can only interact with others to an extent before I have to separate myself. If i don’t separate myself I’ll completely shut down and just kinda sit off in a corner by myself lost in my head, thinking about how much I want to go home and be alone. I want to go a therapist but the thought of telling a stranger all of my problems is so scary. I was in therapy when i was very young (like 8 or 9) but one day I heard my therapist telling my mom EVERYTHING and i completely lost faith in therapy. It was such a betrayal. My mother and I never had a good relationship so there was a reason I was telling my therapist things I wouldn’t tell my mom. It was so embarrassing and heartbreaking to know that this therapist who i had really grown to like and trust was lying to me every day about keeping my secrets. So after that I started lying to my therapist and being very general and standoffish in everything I’d say so she wouldn’t really have anything to tell my mom, and that’s kind of the personality I have now. I don’t tell people personal things about myself, just a very general blanket of information just enough for them to THINK they know me but not enough for them to get close to me. But yea, ever since then I’ve had quite the aversion to therapy. Recently, I’m noticing it’s becoming more and more difficult to perform daily tasks just because the thought alone of having to interact with another person is like the worst thing in the world. I let my car get down to E before going to a gas station because there’s always soo many people at the gas station and i hate when people look at me. I hate going grocery shopping for the same reasons so I’ll either let my house get empty or InstaCart whatever I can. I’m starting to think all my avoidance is not helping, in fact i think it’s making it worse, I’m so used to being by myself that I’d rather jump off a bridge than attempt to interact with others. I’m always very uncomfortable in public no matter what. The only time I can relax and be myself is when I’m alone. When I go out in public there’s like a voice in my head constantly talking telling me everything I’m doing wrong. I have not been diagnosed with any mental illnesses because I have never told anyone my problems. I would really like to get some help I can’t keep living like this I feel like a prisoner in my own brain it’s like sometimes I can’t control my thoughts or feelings because the little mean person in my head is constantly pointing out everything I do wrong. Even if i am talking to somebody and they seem to really like me, that little voice will say something like “they definitely don’t like you, they’re pretending.” When i say something dumb the voice will say “why would you say that, now who is gonna want to be around you you sound dumb”. If i smile at someone in passing on the street to be friendly, the voice in my head will say “why are you smiling at strangers that’s weird now they probably think you’re a crazy person”. If i walk past someone in public and DONT smile, the voice in my head will say “now they think you’re a bitch, you could’ve at least smiled”. I’m sorry this is so long but I’m starting to think I’m going crazy. It’s a CONSTANT war in my head me vs myself. It’s so tiring. The only time I can truly be happy and not lost in my thoughts is when I’m drunk and a few months ago I started developing a drinking and smoking (weed) problem but I’ve stopped drinking because i figured drinking would do a lot more damage than smoking. Smoking really helps me calm down ALOT I don’t feel crazy when I smoke, it’s easier for me to articulate and think and i don’t fixate on my problems when I’m high (sorry i don’t mean to promote drug use or anything, just explaining why this is my coping method). Anyway yall have a good day/night, thanks to anyone who took the time to read. Sorry if this is all over the place, I just thought it would help for me to get my feelings out so i apologize if this isn’t very well structured. IF YOU KNOW ANY GOOD ONLINE THERAPISTS PLEASE POINT ME IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I REALLY WANT TO FIX MYSELF I AM SO SCARED IM GOING TO HAVE A PSYCHOTIC BREAK OR SOMETHING AND I WOULD RATHER FACE MY FEARS OF GOING TO THERAPY THAN TO HAVE A COMPLETE MENTAL BREAK."
2969,Anxiety,DAE feel the same? Also can anyone please help with any possible advice they have?,"I get subtle trembles and racing heart when I have some worryful thought. The thing is when I get involved (yes, found no better word to use) in literally anything - the trembles/shakes/racing all stops to a halt UNTIL I notice that I had such a problem. Then somehow more thinking about it induces it on its own. I did a meditation session focussing on a prayer and I got involved so much that it disappeared and then I being the idiot I am started thinking more about this and now it has started.

I always think of the worst news that could possibly be delivered and I can't pick it.

2972,Anxiety,Really odd things i obsess over,"Hi,

I was diagnosed with anxiety over a year ago, and since then i started noticing the weird thoughts i have. Today something happened that made me realise how weird i am. 

Basically, i have a bestfriend, lets call her Angel, and Angel goes to a university in a different city. When I posted a picture with Angel on my Instagram story, a few people from my university followed her as they know we are bestfriends, and for some reason this bothered me. And not in the way you may assume, but for a very odd reason. I started thinking ""what if people at my university goes on Angel's instagram profile and see that she is followed by other people at our university and they assume she goes to my university, so they think wow her bestfriend is someone she met in university she has no friends outside uni and she has no life

I know its so dumb and weird but seriously i can't stop overthinking it and all i want is to just stop caring about things :( does anyone know how to get rid of these annoying thoughts? These are the kinds of things i suffer with everyday"

2974,Anxiety,How do I stop being anxious?,"My first relationship was very one sided. I always showed the proper about of affection and she hardly ever showed any. She would get mad if I ever shared my feeling and she would start an argument everytime I would do so. Then she said she was crying one night and when I asked about it she said she wasn’t crying and I didn’t press the issue so she said she thought she could hide her feelings and not bother me. She then confided in all of my friends and made herself look like the victim and me the bad guy. After she broke up with me she led me on for a month making me think she wanted to get back together. Even going as far as to kiss me and say she wanted me back. My very first relationship left me with no friends and I get really anxious whenever I see her on social media and stuff or I think about her with another person. It has calmed down but I recently saw a picture of her with a friend who played a big role in rumors, and stuff being spread around, and our breakup in general. I got really anxious because I knew they were going out with my other “ex-friends” and I don’t know what to do to not be anxious. I’ve tried meditation and going on walk. Everytime I try to distract myself with something else I get more anxious and I stop doing whatever it was. It’s really hurting my ability to interact with other people. After the rumors getting around everyone thinks Im a dick. And I find myself getting angrier at little things. I’ve even got a girl who wants to be with me but I don’t think it’s fair to be with her and still get anxious over my ex. I need help

The only place I feel remotely comfortable is in my room with the door closed and the lights off, but now it's becoming a prison. 

I wish I could go outside like everyone else without being scared of being judged.

2978,Anxiety,Can anxiety and panic attacks have extreme physical symptoms?,"Hello there. I am 18f and have been diagnosed with episodes of panic attacks for 8 months now. My parents do no believe in ""mental health problems"" or them needing to be treated so I can't go to a therapist as of now. 

The problem with me is that the symptoms I feel are too physical for me to sideline them as panic attacks. The first time I went to ER was because i had severe trouble breathing, my chest was thumping as if i was scared as shit as if i was having a heart attack. It had happened before also but i tried ignoring it. I didn't imagine having mental health problems since i have a fairly normal life. The hospital discharged me after running couple of tests on my heart saying I am physically fine so it has to be panic attacks. So they recommended seeing a therapist which my father obviously ignored completely. 

My physical symptoms haven't gone away even after the meds I was given. I can't ask my parents to take me to doctor again as I feel like a burden when i go.

My physical symptoms appear way too randomly even when am feeling peaceful and am not stressed like I have trouble breathing for some time then suddenly my heart starts beating like anything then suddenly everything goes away then it all comes back together and i feel like I'm going to die. I really don't know if its panic attacks or something is wrong with my heart or lungs.

Has anyone else experienced such physical symtoms? Please help."
2979,Anxiety,Debilitating “imposter syndrome” and intense anxiety over my job/career...need help changing my mindset please.,"I apologize in advance if this is long! I have been dealing with this for over 9 months and it’s sending me into a depression and just overall ruining my day to day life. Any advice or resources to help would be fantastic (with covid, I’m not in a position to be able to see a therapist right now although I should have months ago...)!

I’m relatively new in my career (2 years) and I feel an overwhelming amount of daily pressure in my job to where it’s ruining my relationships—my job has become the only thing I tie my worth to, I’m constantly working in order to prove my worth to my managers/team and I think about work constantly on the weekend. Not just “oh I need to do this on Monday” but literally dread-filled anxious thoughts of “this is a mess, I messed this up, I’m going to get fired if I screw this up.” I hardly spend time with my husband and I’m always in a bad mood and snap at him all the time because I’m stressed and anxious nearly 24/7 and constantly thinking about work or working.

The messed up part is that I’ve never received negative feedback from my managers—in fact, it’s always the opposite: I’m doing an amazing job, etc etc. but this makes me feel WORSE and full of even more pressure, like I have to keep it up and stick to these high expectations and I can’t let anyone down. I’m afraid with any slip up or mistake, they’ll “find me out” and fire me. I know this is 100% pressure I’m putting on myself, but I don’t know how to stop. In theory, I actually do enjoy what I do, but I dread every single Monday. After the work day is over, I’m constantly checking my emails and responding to people until late when I go to bed—I feel like I can’t leave anyone waiting or they’ll complain that I’m unresponsive/not working hard enough. I only get paid hourly with no OT, so I’m doing all of this unpaid. But I feel like the unspoken expectation is that I have to do this in order to keep everyone happy (my boss has literally said before that I’ll succeed in this field if I just keep everyone happy).

I think there’s a lot about my work environment that is toxic, but because I’m new to the field, I feel like this is the best I’ll get and I’m worried if I find another job, I either won’t get paid as much (I already feel I’m overpaid) or the environment is even worse. I truly feel so stuck. I simultaneously am terrified of being fired/laid off, but also hope that it does happen so that I can breathe again.

How can I change my mindset to stop being obsessed with work and tying my self-worth to my career/money? I can’t live like this."

2981,Anxiety,Severe Caffeine Sensitivity - Anxiety attack yesterday,"As I get older I have noticed my sensitivity to caffeine has increased. It's very frustrating as everyone around me downs their coffee and goes back for a second round, or drinks their energy drink with no problem. Yet I go into full panic mode if I go beyond my (very small) threshold. 

I've been managing it well for several months drinking matcha and limiting caffeine. However, I decided to drink some coffee yesterday AM, just because - it was great and I wanted it! In the afternoon I was working an event and a friend brought some organic Yerba Matte energy drinks for everyone (160mg caffeine). Worst mistake... 

Within an hour I felt that familiar uneasiness (it's the worst, and I know you guys know!). Heart racing, anxiety, dread and worry something terrible is going to happen. Moreover, I started to get pain between my shoulder blades and freaking out because I started googling that and seeing awful things like cancer, heart attack, etc... which kicked my anxiety into high gear. I walked away and felt light-headed and low energy. Just bad. 

Came back and friend gave me food, I realized I had barely anything to eat and I was in the sun all day.  I started to feel better after eating and the anxiety attack and symptoms dissolved within that following hour. 

HOW do I stop this from happening? Obviously I may be sensitive to caffeine and it is a trigger but... it's just not fair! I don't want to feel like something terrible is going to happen to me if I decide to have an energy drink."

2984,Anxiety,Health anxiety,"Trigger warning: talks on disordered eating habits and fertility issues.

Hi guys. To get straight to the point, I’m having health anxiety pertaining to possible fertility issues.

I’ve had irregular periods since menarche which I think are caused by disordered eating habits. It all started when I was a teenager, probably around 13, when I developed an unhealthy relationship with food. I would restrict my calories. Whenever I ate, I’d make sure to purge. If not, I’ll exercise the heck out of myself. This made my period very wonky.

I’m 22 now, with irregular periods and I’m afraid I can’t have babies. Yeah this may seem too far-fetched of a problem to think of but I’m genuinely scared. The only reason I have to live is that I want to build a family of my own and make my parents happy. Sad to say that if I’m unable to do these things I’m better off dead. I’m chronically depressed so really, there’s nothing much to lose.

My appointment with the gynae is on the 11th. As the day comes closer I get even more anxious. I’m afraid they’re gonna tell me I did this to myself. In fact, I’m pretty sure I did. I’m afraid I’m gonna have another breakdown because of this. I’m afraid I can’t forgive myself. I failed my own body."

However, as I am still a beginner, running everyday is not recommended because of the strain on my joints and muscles. I can really tell the difference between a non running day and a running day. For those of you who run, or do other workouts, and notice a similar difference in their mental wellbeing; which other type of exercise really helps you?

Please let me know if I’ve used the right flair, I’m new to this sub. Was doubting between this one and Health, but I could of course also be wrong altogether."
2987,Anxiety,How are you meant to process to possibility of bad things? What’s the meaning of all this?,"That’s a confusing title, but let me try to explain what I’m saying. Hypothetical scenario:

Let’s say a beloved family member is in the hospital with a rare disease that’s potentially lethal. However, with their age and body type, they only have a .1% chance of dying to the illness, and you won’t know they’re safe until 2 weeks pass. How are you supposed to be able to function in those 2 weeks? Why does my mind see the bad outcome as something that will surely happen? It would be like I already consider them dead, and start trying to cope with life without them even though they’re right there and will probably be fine...

As I said, none of this happened. I’m just trying to explain my problem in hopes of someone being able to give a solution

I can’t just keep on living life like this... scared my bank account will be hacked, scared I left my keys in my car, scared I’m gonna fail out of school, scared my parents will forget me

And of course scared I or someone I know would get COVID, which is what inspired this post. The past few months of my life have been miserable because of so many hypothetical things I’m scared of, is there no way to get over this? Is this all there is to life? Just constant fear and worry accompanied by painful symptoms? All the while people just see you as weird or ungrateful?

Please, I look at these forums every day and I refuse to believe this is some incurable mental illness that god gave to some people for seemingly no reason? Why wasn’t I given the ability to stay calm and enjoy life as it is?"
2988,Anxiety,Good and Bad?,"First panic attack since March 11th. I started Celexa 10mg on March 4th, had a sort of hard time for the first two weeks but got better fast. Doctor wanted me on 20mg but i’m scared to up it because of the heart issues that are known to happen at higher doses. I’m 23 Female. I had a little panic attack just 15 minutes ago it’s 5:30am where i’m from. To be honest I handled it pretty well, normally i’d start bawling and shaking and pacing and calling my mom, i live with my boyfriend but my mom comforts me more than anyone, and id flip out saying i’m dying. Well, I did pace a little and did have thoughts i was dying but it went away in 15 minutes and i handled it better than before. Although I was hoping for the attacks to be gone completely, they have simmered down a lot which is great. Asking doctor to prescribe me low dose ativan until i can beat this anxiety with my psychologist. Does anyone have a similar story or anything i can do to help bump up the success of possibly getting rid of panic even more? thank you much"
2989,Anxiety,i don’t feel anything,"things that used to make me happy, I don’t care about. I used to be so passionate about dancing and it was my world, now I don’t care for it. Same with school, I used to be committed and motivated and inspired and determined to be my best all the time but I don’t feel anything.

I work hard in school. I study every night for 4.5 hours and I've always done this. well for the last 3 years, before that, I was rebelling, I didn’t care about education. I got suspended twice and got in trouble at school. then I did. I went from Cs to straight Bs within a year. Like I was doing great. First place in Drama, best female athlete, top 10 in all my classes.... whatever

My school isn’t full of the smartest people, they don’t care about education at all. There’s a class for those who care and they happen to be arrogant so I never joined that class but had so many opportunities to. I wanted to prove everyone wrong and show I could do it without being privileged and I can do anything because I'm intelligent and determined.

I developed an eating disorder after being surrounded by friends who called me fat and ugly all the time so I made it a goal to lose weight. I was bullied by my dance group badly. so shit was tough. it became my norm that I was never going to be good enough no matter how good I was. but I got over it because I'm tough and I'm strong and focused on my grades. I’ve still been struggling to eat but I try my best. 

my issue is that I never get rewarded for how hard I work. I'm always second best and I never get a chance. sometimes I think the teachers are biased because of who I used to be and the fact I challenge them academically with debates just pisses them off. (pls understand I go to a low SES school) my grades are now a mix between mostly As and some Bs, still hold the best female athlete award and still first in drama. I did a lot to get where I am but unfortunately, I just feel everyone is so against me. I got told that I did super good in my pe assignment and that there were no changes to be made. after I handed it in, I got my marks back, 13/15, second best and my teacher had a long paragraph to criticise my work but he gave no feedback in my drafts. I got 25/25 for my CAFS assignment, first place for once and I was so fucking happy and thought this was my breakthrough. this was my shot. Then I found out about 6 people also got full marks. that’s when I started to feel absolutely nothing for anyone or anything because this has happened to me for the last 3 years. always second best. not good enough and will never be good enough.

I’m not complaining about failure. that’s life and I just have to work harder next time. I understand that. I feel like my efforts are never properly rewarded. I work so hard and don't get recognised ever like fucking ever. these teachers blow so much smoke up my ass but it's all a lie, it's not genuine. I've lost all motivation and have lost purpose. I deserve better but I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore. why the hell do I want to be the best? 

for a long time, I just wanted to prove them all wrong. prove my haters wrong. show them that I can do anything. but now my whole world is falling apart and people keep letting me down... I am tired of not being seen for who I am. now I’m constantly angry and I’m not that type of person. 


please give me some solid advice because I’m not one to give up easily but I’ve been trying so hard to feel something, anything and I can’t... I want to be better. I want to be me. I want to care. I want to find joy in the things I used to.

maybe isolation is killing me."
2990,Anxiety,Listening to music gives me anxiety because I think other people might hear it,"does anyone else get this? if I'm in public listening to music with earbuds I constantly take my earbuds out to make sure it isnt too loud and no one else is hearing it. I will then repeat this process in 30 seconds cause I think it's too loud. 

Or if I'm in my car BY MYSELF I turn the music down because I think people will hear it. Like in my head I imagine my mom for example is sitting beside me and I turn it down because I dont want her to judge what I'm listening to, even if she isnt in the car."
2991,Anxiety,Anxiety causes intrusive thoughts,"Does anyone else’s anxiety just overwhelm them into thinking just impossible scenarios or things you’d never worry about when you’re not anxious? I feel like a shell of my confident self when my anxiety settles into my mind. My OCD tends to linger on things where I become acutely aware of trying to ignore it, etc. I am in therapy and I know all the techniques but I just wonder if anyone else has these impossible scenarios too. Sometimes they worry me even though I know they aren’t real."
2992,Anxiety,Random and Sudden Anxiety,"Hello!

I have a problem that I thought had been resolved, but I had another episode for the first time in a while so I guess not. It’s basically these random, sudden onset’s of anxiety that put me into a state of fight-or-flight panic where I make irrational decisions that I end up beating myself up over after the episode. 

Here’s an example of it:
Today I went on an amazing hike with my bf. It was wonderful and I even went the long drive there and back without issue (which can be hard for me). We got back to his parents house (yay for college being canceled and returning home) and ate an early dinner. I knew in the back of my head that I was a bit nervous because I was over there much earlier than normal and didn’t want to overstay my welcome. I hate bothering people, especially those who I see are in a higher position of power. This small but or nervousness did effect my ability to get comfortable, but I eventually tried to ignore it. It was all good till his dad calls up and asks how long I’ll be staying over (in a nice manner). This caused an a fight-or-flight like response in me. I immediately got up and decided I needed to leave because I was being a bother, while simultaneously not wanting to leave then and make things awkward. 

My bf picked up on this and went and got my purse and shoes and helped me leave. I felt horrible afterwards because I felt like I ruined a wonderful day all because I had a sudden anxious episode.

I’ve noticed that it happens more whenever I’m tired (either mentally or physically). I just need some ways to calm down when I’m in this situation. Or some things he can do to help me calm down (because I know he thinks that no matter how hard he tries he can't make the freak out stop, which may be true idk). I don’t want it to ruin another relationship, especially when I thought I had resolved it."
2993,Anxiety,What medication helps with anxiety,"I'm going back to school to get an advanced degree and I've taken another bachelors to prepare. Anxiety is pretty constant, but it isn't stopping me from doing well. I am afraid that once I start going to school where the pressure might be much higher that it'll effect my performance plus I don't want to feel like a weight is on my chest all the time. Next time I see my doctor I'm going to talk to him about it, but what sort of medication do you guys use? I use xannax for sleep.

Thanks."
2994,Anxiety,Laziness,"when i feel overwhelmed i feel best when i’m doing nothing. but then later i feel anxious because i’ve accomplished nothing. and especially with this whole pandemic and being home i’ve had this happen 2-3 days a week where i just do nothing even though i have a lot to do, i just can’t bring myself to be productive. just wondering if anyone else gets like this, i believe it’s the combination of depression and anxiety just messing with me a little extra"
2995,Anxiety,I feel like I’m dying,"I’m having the worst anxiety attack I’ve ever had right now heart is racing beyond control hot flashes , feeling sick to my stomach , dehydrated and shaky anyone else get this how do you come down before your heart explodes"
2996,Anxiety,Anxious and cheated on my midterm through respondus lockdown. Thinking about telling my professor. What should I do??,"This is the first time I’ve ever used Respondus Lockdown before. The professor required us to use webcam. I was very anxious to begin with, knowing that I’m being recorded and sent to the professor, just completely stresses me out. And I’m very unprepared. I wasn’t aware that we’re having midterm until I it popped up just today on the announcement. I was feeling overwhelmed, I literally spent the first 25mins on the first number. I’m getting so worked out that I’m not going to finish on time plus I feel pressured to get good grades (my gpa’s really low) and I failed the class before. I opened the book, and finding answers on chegg, I was out of time. I think I was at question 11 /18 and only 40/ 120mins left. And stupid me took a pic of the rest of the question, to do it after the time is over. Its a test where you write the answers on paper and upload with cam scanner. 

I feel so guilty and anxious right now. I’ve never cheated before on a quiz/midterm/finals. I’m thinking about telling my professor about it.. and have a discussion but I’m scared because I know I’m going to get 0 for it and get reported to dean. I’m an international student, so this will fucked my visa big time. What should I do??? Please help."
2997,Anxiety,I'm such a dumbass...,"And now I'm forced to lay awake thinking about it.

I've always had issues with processing. I'm not sure why but I'm assuming it has to do with my childhood trauma.

I was at a thrift store and I went to a change room with 5 items.

A lady who worked there said something to me (she had an accent which makes things SOOOOOOO much worse with my processing) and I didn't understand so I asked her to repeat.

I didn't understand again so I asked her to repeat and at this point, she looked frustrated so I panicked and did the first thing that I thought she could mean and hung the clothes on the stall door.

Why would she even have been saying anything like that to me??! There are hooks on the wall and I just looked like a complete dumbass.

Turns out she said ""only three clothing items"" and she let out a huge grumpy sigh as she took my extra clothes away herself...still with me not knowing what was happening.

I had to ask my boyfriend afterwards what the fuck she even said...at which point, I felt like a complete dumbass.

I know I come off as rude/annoying because I can't just listen and I know I can't fix it but the anxiety it causes me is so fucking much to deal with."
2998,Anxiety,Getting a job,"Earlier this year I quit my job at a popular grocery store because of a situation with another employee and management scheduling me when I had class after writing down my availability several times. I decided to take a small break but now it’s time to get a new job. Does anyone have any suggestions for someone with extreme social anxiety? The jobs I struggle with most are serving, hosting, and drive through restaurants so none of that please."
2999,Anxiety,Buspar,"Hi there! Just recently started Buspar. No complaints, hasn't even been a week yet though. My 21st birthday is coming up, and you guys know what that means.. my friends are going to want to get me WASTED. Has anyone mixed alcohol and Buspar? It says not to, but I have a strong feeling people have done it. Any thoughts?"
3000,Anxiety,Anxiety/ derealization/ lexapro?,"This will likely be long, so thank you I’m advanced for reading. So I guess this all started about 3ish weeks ago. I have always been somewhat of an over thinker throughout my life, almost never depressed, and have been able to overcome these feelings almost overnight. I am 22 yr old who has been physically active since I can remember and never had any mental health issues. I almost believed they didn’t exist only because I had always felt pretty normal. 

I was pretty on edge about Covid, since I am a Senior in college and have felt robbed of my last semester. I feel like I won’t have closure from my college experience. It definitely weighed me down but it wasn’t anything that was too overwhelming and still felt alright. I also was pretty scared of contracting the virus and falling seriously ill from it. 

But one night a couple weeks ago, I got too high and had a panic attack. ( I have smoked that last four years almost daily so I definitely had built up a strong tolerance which makes this so weird. ) I never had experienced one before and truly felt that I was going to die or pass out at times. I had gotten too high once before like that a couple years ago and felt feelings of derealization, but those feelings quickly faded. But this time it was different in that I felt entirely like a different person after this event. 

Since then, I have been almost constantly anxious and have had multiple panic attacks. I feel out of touch with reality at times and feel a constant brain fog along with this anxiety. It is just so bizarre to me that I have never even felt close to this, and it hasn’t gone away over the past couple weeks. I have vivid dreams almost nightly now as well that often leave me shaken up the next day. I feel better at times, but then I just remember how shitty the anxiety is and it comes back with a vengeance. 

I am going through job interviews for post-grad and trying to plan my next steps, but not being able to overcome these feelings has left me depressed as I feel like I can’t do these things I had planned for after my graduation. 

I consulted my doctor and was prescribed 5 mg lexapro, but I haven’t started as I feel that it might do more harm than good. I feel out of touch with everything and honestly just feel like an entirely different person. I want to feel better more than anything, but I am not sure if taking lexapro will help. 

Not really sure if I’m looking for any kind of response, I just really wanted to get this off my chest and see if anyone else had experienced anything like this."
3001,Anxiety,did your sexual side effect after stoping Celexa go away ?,please mention your ;[gender.age.how](https://gender.age.how) long you took it for what reason.what were your side effects.and how long it took to sexually you return to normal and if you havent return. how serious is your problem thank you (: this can be helpful
3002,Anxiety,I went through a drive thru today,"I know it doesnt sound like much but I've put of driving for so long. I am 25 and I just got my G2 a few months ago. I'm a super anxious driver and it really stresses me out because the one road to get to all the grocery stores and restaurants is really busy and aside from the ten blocks in town it's a highway so ppl from the city drive like crazy.

But today I went to a grocery store on the other side of town and then picked up dinner for my family. I went though a crazy busy intersection twice and then did the one thing I've been super scared too. I have no idea why a drive thru seemed so scary but I did it. I even had to do it a second time because they messed up one of the combos and I didn't notice until I was home.

So yea...today I went through a drive thru and I'm kinda proud of myself, regardless of the fact that the first time through I hopped the curb by accident. 

Thanks for reading"
3003,Anxiety,"I don't know how to answer when I have a panic attack and someone asks ""what can I do to help?"". Does anyone else feel this way?","
I really appreciate it when a friend is trying to be supportive and asks what they can do to help.
The thing is, I don't even know what I can do to help myself so I just don't have any ideas what they can do to help me.

Also, I end up just isolating myself because I find myself caring too much not to bother them (this alone is tiring) and I'm just too used to being on my own. 
Again, I appreciate their intentions but it's hard to answer.
Does anyone else experience this? What do you say to them?"
3004,Anxiety,:),"In life we must accept that we will lose everything and everyone we have ever known. Whenever we hold on to something out of desperation just to say we still have it we ruin our joy. It is truly an illusion to think that there is anything to hold on to. The act of letting go and being in the present moment towards the things we experience in life is were we find fulfillment. To experience without the desire of holding on :). 

I found so much happiness and comfort in this. I hope this helps."
3005,Anxiety,Today Sucked!,"Today just wasn’t  my day. I’m tired of the shadow of anxiety that lurks behind every corner, every door, every damn notification. I’m tired of the ball of worms that reek havoc on my stomach. I’m tired of feeling like I have to vomit just because I got triggered. The worst part of anxiety is knowing it’s all irrational.  Sometimes life needs a damn pause button. I’m tired of being drained from this evil thing.  Yet, my ball and chain will be there tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. Sometimes you just have to ride the wave I guess. Cheers for a new tomorrow."
3006,Anxiety,"Will everyone catch Covid-19 eventually? I'm doing as much right as I can to prevent it, but thinking about catching it makes me anxious all day and keeps me up at night.","Does anyone know the answer to my post's title question? Or at least some more of possible answer?

I am suffering from lots of anxiety these days, over the possibility of catching Covid-19.

I am told by my health care professionals, that due to my very weakened immune system, I won't be able to fight it off. (I'm mid-twenties)

Is anyone else scared shitless?

Does anyone else spend too much time reading about the virus and makes you super anxious all day?"
3007,Anxiety,Anxiety around older family members who in the past constantly made you feel like shyt,"Me and my mom are better now. But 3 years ago and so forth, we were not. It's great that we get along WAY better now, but I still feel anxiety like I can't mess up around her or else I'll start crying. I wish I didn't feel this way, but being cautious of myself around her is what I had to do growing up with her and without her or else I'd be degraded, grounded, spanked etc. I guess I'm just here to vent, because no one in my life will listen to me"
3008,Anxiety,Environmentalism and existentialism,"I hope this isn’t too political, this is just what I can’t stop thinking about.
I don’t know how to sleep at night.
I’m three years deep into an environmental science degree and I feel like I’ve cursed myself with forbidden knowledge. All we’ve learned about it how screwed we are, and god damn has it scared me straight. Yet, I don’t feel empowered or knowledgeable. I feel hopeless. I can’t count the amount of sleepless nights I’ve spent lying awake fearing for the inevitable and uncontrollable environmental collapse that seems to be getting closer and closer with every study. Despair about why people in power don’t care, guilt for not being able to change my lifestyle in a way that I should/need to, knowing that even if myself and every other person overhauled their lifestyle it still wouldn’t be enough. 
It makes me not want to care about my future, it makes me not want to have kids, it makes me resent those older than me and those who aren’t as conscientious as me. It makes me wish I was just ignorant and stupid. I wonder how I’m supposed to function and be happy with this feeling of existentialism constantly drooping over me. I can’t even talk about it with people I know because it’s either preaching to the choir or talking to a brick wall. I need a big warm hug and the earth needs a big cool washcloth on its forehead. Damn."
3009,Anxiety,How can I stop looking into the past?,"I keep getting anxiety from past things and I stopped doing some things because I remember when I did them while being on panic/anxiety situations, whenever I think of doing them, my mind just kind of creates some sort of fear towards doing that thing again because of the last memory I had about it. As an example, when I think of drawing, my mind holds me back from doing it because I remember that the last time I was drawing, it was during a moment filled up with anxiety."
3010,Anxiety,Life on meds,I feel so alone taking these pills everyday to take the edge off of my anxiety and depression. Tried talking to friends and family. No one understands they look at me as if I'm mentally unstable for being on antidepressants. Being honest I'm just feeling alone. Not fishing for attention just trying to feel less alone on this planet.
3011,Anxiety,How many “I’m going to die” panic attacks can I have in a week?,"Totally irrational. Don’t make sense. I’m not going to die. But you couldn’t convince me of that otherwise.

If you never see me make another post, this was it. I died.

Do you want to know what I am worrying about? That I accidentally swallowed some taco meat up into my nose and it’s going to kill me. But I have no idea of I actually did. This was yesterday. Now, my nostril is clogged up and my ear fills full. Waiting for the fever before I freak out. Not googling symptoms or time lines or anything. Fuckkkk I hate this. Depression has me “I want to die” and anxiety is all “omg we might die, panic!!!” I know you can die from that stuff. But seriously could I just calm down."
3012,Anxiety,Working from home during quarantine but now I don’t want to go back.,"Being able to work from home has completely depleted all the stress hormones I experienced when having to commute to an office everyday in a crowded train as well as just being in an office with lot of other people.  Everyday at work my anxiety is always high throughout the day to the point id get headaches from all the stress. Been working from home for almost two months now and I no longer get headaches in the middle of the day. I feel lighter and more productive for work. I almost feel like a new person. I actually notice I smile throughout the day because I can feel the sunshine while I work unlike the office where I can only stare at the white walls. 

Im scared because i need the paycheck, and i don’t know if i have the right education or experience for a better job, one that may let me work from home permanently. Im dreading like hell having to go back because I don’t want to experience that shit anymore."
3013,Anxiety,Panic/hypochondria issues tonight.,"So tonight I was feeling over all decent. But after I finished playing a video game ((sitting on the floor with crossed legs for about half abs hour to an hour)) my legs were asleep. I instantly began to freak out. Looking up things about diabetes. Or other health related issues. This started around 1:30am. It’s now 3:00am and I’m feeling fine physically, I’m just still extremely anxious. I have been drinking a good bit more ever since quarantine began. Sort of my way to ‘cope’ with everything. Though I know it’s not healthy. At least the way I drink. But my anxiety has been at an all time high tonight. I can’t sleep. If my legs or feet feel any weird way I begin to freak out again. But keep in mind, they don’t feel weird unless I really begin to think about them. Like now. My psychiatrist told me at my last visit that I’m definitely a hypochondriac. I pretty much knew ever since I was a kid. I’m just having a much harder time tonight. Thinking I have issues I may not. And before you recommend it, I don’t have a primary care doctor to see. I’ve been going to the urgent cares/minute clinics for about 2 years now ever since my old PMC office shut down. My mind just won’t settle tonight. Maybe I need to lay off the alcohol. No, I know I need to. It’s just hard, especially when you want to numb your emotions/anxieties... tonight has just been anxiety overload"
3014,Anxiety,Prozac withdrawal,"With the pandemic putting a lot of pressure on healthcare workers, I haven't been able to get some of my medications in time. Today marks the second week I've been without Prozac/Fluoxitine, and I've been feeling a weird ""fading away"" feeling. Like, if I don't pay attention to what I'm doing and my surroundings, I feel like I'm fading out of reality. There's even a sort of soft ringing in my head when it happens. I can't find anything on the internet that says anything about this, but could this be a symptom of withdrawal? Sorry if this is a bit disorganized. Typing is getting difficult.

Before you all panic, please know that I'll be able to get my medication tomorrow if not the day after."
3015,Anxiety,"Want to start working, but anxious at the idea. Any tips?","I really want some extra spending money, but I'm anxious at the idea of a part-time job. I initially was thinking about doing something this summer, but because of everything that's happening right now I'll probably have to push that back to next summer. Either way, does anyone have any tips or things I should know before I get a job? (I'm considering babysitting and or petsitting)"

3017,Anxiety,Intimidated,I just got a new job and i has to go in to drop off some paperwork today and the people that I’m gonna be working with intimidate me. I’m against racism but when I’m there they all stare at me. I get it partially because I’m the new one but I also feel like it’s because I’m white. The managers there are white but i don’t have any coworkers who I feel like I can start a friendship with because they all are in their group already. Everyone I saw in there today were in their 20’s and were all men. I’m 18 and a girl and white and I’m super scared. I took melatonin to sleep cuz I have to go in at 6am today for my first shift but I woke up at 2 and can’t sleep cuz of my anxiety. No one else is awake right now and I’m trying to calm down but man it’s just hard.
3018,Anxiety,Stuck in a loop,"I've never been diagnosed with anxiety, and I don't know if I even have it, I just don't know where else to put this. 

I start thinking about something normal, like today I was thinking about when I'd start work up again (I teach kids to swim), but I starting thinking about every little thing that could go wrong, even though it is something I do everyday. I don't know why it happens, but it gets to the point of all I can think about it how terrified I am of it. Today I couldn't stop thinking what happens if I get coughed on? Will I get sick? When If a kid slips and breaks a bone? What if one of the parents starts screaming at me? What if a kid drowns? What will I do? What if I just freeze up?

It got to the point that I started thinking of suicide. It can't be healthy, but I have no idea how to deal with it. I am near tears for hours at a time.

Please help."
3019,Anxiety,Anxiety over returning to work,"Hi everyone. I hope you’re all staying healthy and calm! I was laid off at the end of March from my hotel job and have been in quarantine with my fiancé since. It took about a Month to adjust to a routine but I’ve actually started doing great! I got my eating on track, I’ve taken up yoga and roller skating and we’ve finally gotten some movies off our “must see” list. But today it finally happened, I got the phone call that I can return to work. At first I asked if I could return towards the end of June which my boss was fully supportive of (my fiancé is immunocompromised so I was worried of endangering him). Until my boss informed me that if I turn down the work right now I’ll have to report it to unemployment and potentially lose my benefits. Can’t have that, gotta pay bills. SO I agreed to go back. Since that call I’ve been so anxious. I just feel dread and panic sitting on my shoulders. I JUST got adjusted to this routine and now I have to go right back into work and try to navigate. I know many are doing it right now and so any tips from those of you working with the public right now would be really encouraging. I just feel anxious that nothing will ever be the same and I’ll never have time like this ever again. Its been nice to actually have time to focus on my hobbies and interests and spend time with my loved one. I dont know. I know I should be grateful, most people DONT have the luxury of returning to work. I’m trying to stick with the gratitude and let the rest melt away. Stay sane loves!"
3020,Anxiety,Feel like my anxiety is not as good as other people's anxiety,"Like many, I've been especially anxious since the lockdown started in my city. I started following a couple of anxiety related pages on Instagram. Every post that I see makes me feel like there are people out there who have real/ actual/ significant anxiety. I haven't had a panic attack in months and my anxiety is so lame or superficial when compared to what some people are going through.

Not even my anxiety is tier 1, you know?

I am a 32M,who suffers from severe anxiety,OCD and mild depression and as a result lead a very dysfunctional,sheltered life.I used to believe that sad,painful works of fiction could work therapeutically for people with mental health problems but after reading this manga series I don't know anymore...That sense of resignation,the reminder of how chaotic and messed up life can be was something I currently didn't need in my life and I almost regret reading it.I know it's just fiction but I feel burdened with the weight of witnessing everything that unfolded in the lives of these characters,which is of course the point and aim of this story but was in worth it?I'm in more pain right now than I already was before reading it and in the verge of crying just by writing this.

I'm sorry if there is no real point in my post,I just needed to vent a little,maybe even talk about how sad media affect us.I really hope everyone who posts or lurks here can find happiness and hold on to it as long as possible."

3026,Anxiety,I Posted this in R/HealthAnxiety but couldn't get anyone to give some advice. I'm losing sleep over this and don't know what my next step should be.,"I hope it isn't against the rules to post this here. 


I'm not really sure how to start this other then that I could really use some advice or some help. About 3 months ago I woke up in the middle of night shaking. The kind of shaking you get when your stomach hurts, or you're About to throw up. But my stomach wasn't hurting, nor was a I cold. It scared me and I was convinced I had some type of illness and this was just the start of it. Over time I just forgot about it really and moved on convinced that I was okay and have been fine ever since. Then 3 days ago I woke up in the middle of the night with my palms drenched in sweat, and them being a bit cool and clammy. I've been known to hyperventilate in my sleep it's a reoccurring habit when I panic even while I'm awake and thought to myself that this is just a side effect but I've been doing this for years and have never had this happen. I also noticed my veins were receding and the color under my nails went pale white as they do when something is severely wrong with your liver and or heart with that came this weird feeling like I knew in my head that something's not right with my body and I'm unsure of what it is. But because of this I've been getting little sleep as I'm a bit afraid to fall asleep. When I do, I usually wake up every 2-3 hours panicking. The one main thing I noticed from this is that when I yawn, or take a deep and even laugh the lower part of my abdomen feels tight or full and I'm unsure of what that is or if it's just a side effect of anxiety. Any help is very much appreciated as im unsure of whether to go to the ER if it worsens or is persistent.


Edit: I have been working a ton of 3rd shifts but I usually end up sleeping 8-9 hours after working those 3rd shifts"

3029,Anxiety,How do I talk to my family about my need for counseling?,"Hi! New to the sub. Hope this isnt like a over asked question, but I'm really at a loss.

I've always had a lot of anxiety and self esteem issues, and its sucked, but for the most part life has been busy enough to keep me distracted from impending doom and self destruction. I mainly have social anxiety, and believe that everyone secretly hates me, and that I'm not worth the effort. 

Quarantine has destroyed all my efforts at bettering myself. Because of school, I've been forced out there around people and friends, forced to face my constant fears and anxieties. But now in quarantine, all my progress towards being a better me has disappeared. It's been like 50 days at this point, and it's really destroying me mentally. 

I feel like I need to see someone. I have no idea how any of this works, as I've been hiding how bad it is, and have never had a counselor or therapy before. How do I introduce my family to the idea? It's scary to think about talking about just how bad it is on me right now, I dont want to seem so weak and vulnerable... yet I fear how bad I'll be at the end of this. 

Tldr: Anxiety, self hate. How do I talk to my family about a need for counseling?

Thanks for reading!"
3030,Anxiety,I feel like vomiting every time I feel excitement,"I’m a 15 yr old guy and I’ve suffered from really bad anxiety for the last couple of years. Every time I want to meet up with a friend, I get excited of course, and then that leads to a stomach ache. As time passes my stomach ache gets worse to the point where I feel dizzy and ready to vomit, which has actually happened once before while going to a friends house. Luckily her and her mom were completely understanding of my anxiety and didn’t have a problem with me coming over again sometime. Today I’m going to be meeting up with the same friend to go on a little walk, and as you may have guessed, I’m starting to have this anxious feeling again. The thing I fear most is vomiting, that’s it, and I really do want to see my friend and hang out with her more, but it’s kinda hard when every single time you do something that gets you excited, you start feeling sick to your stomach. Any advice or encouragement would be appreciated."

3032,Anxiety,Guilt Over a Mistake,"Just looking for some support to maybe lessen the guilt and anxiety after making a mistake at work. I worked with corporate to have a member of upper management fired for stealing - this is not what makes me feel guilty, she was stealing a tom of money and trying to make me an accomplice. The official statement was that she chose to not return to work and stay home with her family (she just had a baby). The rumor was already gloating around since last year, and word got around about what happened. One of my coworkers got a little gossipy and gave away more information than he should have. My guilt and anxiety comes in here. When approached by people I didn't deny the rumors and even agreed with some of the statements. Later, corporate told me our location is the source of the rumor and if they find out who it was they'll be fired. I know realistically they likely won't fire anyone, people had already suspected it and there were some things I couldn't avoid, like another manager seeing me pack of the offending manager's office before she was let go. But I can't stop feeling incredibly guilty and sick over the part I played in the gossip and absolutely terrified about losing my job. I'm the sole provider for my family. I know I shouldn't have even engaged in the conversation and I'm dying inside. I've always had anxiety but at this point I spend all day on the verge of tears and am physically sick. I asked my now immediate supervisor for guidance and she never responded to me which is making me even more anxious that they're planning on letting me go.

Sorry this is so long, I just need some help/advice."

3034,Anxiety,Did an online coding challenge but after submitting I realised it could have gone better,"As per the title I was really pleased initially with what I submitted to this online test.

I was under a lot of time pressure and completed the tasks with about 15 minutes to remain.

There is no way to go back and review and revise my answers now.

It's really winding me up as I know I could have given a low efficient answer now.

Is it worth me contacting the recruiter and outlining what I could have done better?

Should I just hope I get through to the next round and then discuss my improvements with the company?

I strongly believe I've done enough but it's just not optimal. I think I'm judging myself unfairly and it will be enough to know what could have been done better and take that knowledge into three next round.

What do you think I should do?"

My whole life I’ve wanted to do something a bit more creative for a living and once I actually got into music I realised that it was the thing for me. I love the idea of playing for people and writing music. I love creating! The only thing is that I get extreme anxiety attacks during and after showing someone a riff I came up with.
Yesterday my music teacher wanted an example of a rock riff to show the class so I volunteered. My hands were shaking and my mind went completely blank. I had an attack that lasted for an hour and the rest of the day I was exhausted and I felt like an idiot. I’m finished school next year and this is the only thing that sticks out as something I would really love to do but my own body is working against me.

3045,Anxiety,"I think I may have anxiety now, Help?","Hi Redditors

So it began by procrastinating a lot on assignments and papers, which worked for me. I managed to get things done on time and with a level of quality that was acceptable for my college self, but over the past 2 years it has evolved into something much worse and incapacitating.

Now I'm 5 days away from graduating with approximately 10 large assignments I have left to finish and every time I try to sit down and work on them I start to think about how monumentally fucked I am and my heart begins to race, my breathing gets hard and loud and my hands start to shake until I stop and start doing something else like watch TV, play video games, or browse reddit. The shakiness and heart rate comes whenever I'm not thinking about anything specifically distracting me from my situation.

Any advice on how to mitigate this so that I can actually sit down and get at least some of my work done so that I can graduate would be greatly appreciated!"
3046,Anxiety,Can't decide to take my driving license because of panick attack,"Hey everyone,
I have been delaying starting the driving license courses because for some reason it makes me very anxious. It's not something I want, but I know i have to take them so im not a burden to others. 
But I already get a few panick attacks once in a while (nothing serious, its still manageable), and i am afraid it will get worse. Just the thought of me driving is terrifying, I cant even picture it.

3048,Anxiety,Hitting myself on anxiety attacks,"This post will be deleted in a couple of days (maybe weeks) because i don´t want it to appear on my profile history. I´m actually writing this because it is my only way of asking for advice/help.

Sometimes, all of a sudden, i get a feeling of uncontrollable anxiety attacks, i start hyperventilating for no reason and the last times i channeled it in the form of rage. I feel an enormous preassure and angerness building inside, mostly because of stupid and meaningless things, till the point it seems that the only way to make it stop is to explode on the outside, screaming and sometimes, even hitting myself. This past years the number of attacks decreased signifficantly than before, it had gotten worse

To make it clear, i´d never, ever hit a wall, a glass or a person/ animal. I mostly hit cushions or stuff that i know it won´t break. The thing is, sometimes i hit myself, yesterday i got so mad i ended up having pretty bad bruises on my fingers that still hurt .I don´t have enough words to describe how ashamed i am of myself for doing that. I´m afraid of doing something unforgivable.

Does anyone else has a similar experience?

I teach stress and anxiety management and want to start teaching online.

To get comfortable with the platform and method of delivery, I am looking for a few people that are experiencing stress and anxiety and want practical tools to manage it and gain power over it.

Please send me a private message if you are interested."
3050,Anxiety,"Quarantine makes me want to try to stop using SSRI (Paxil/Seroxate/Paroxetine), tips appreciated since after 21 years I have never actually quit successfully and the withdrawal seems worse than my anxiety.","tl;dr: How did you successfully taper off the use of Paxil/Seroxate/Paroxetine? (I'm on 20mg btw)

&amp;#x200B;

Yep, like the title says I want to quit I'm doing fine in life but generalised anxiety makes me dry heave and is a low key ""energy leak"" that makes me exhausted, but I want to try being off them to see how it is. After all, it's been a long time on them despite I feel relatively like a mild case of a person with anxiety. I'm happy for that despite this being like having an invisible ball and chain around my leg. 

I've realized that the pandemic actually could give me the 3 months of calm work life, a window I feel I would need to discontinue the damn thing. My meds do not make me indifferent or anything, I think I'm actually very much ""me"" compared to the typical posts of people wanting their personality back. 

So why do I want to quit? I want to test ""me"" without the meds. I want to find out if I could be more energetic and get more shit done as I feel sluggish. 

  
Paxil  are known to be hard to get off as the half-life is just 24h, this I really just learned these last few weeks. Prozac on the other hand has a halflife of days, which should make it easier to quit. But I don't want to go through a process of switching drugs if a different drug actually would make me that classic indifferent person as SSRI is often known to do. 

I also have, when lately reading up, suddenly understood that the  weird phenomenon I have of feeling feverish every evening for days on end is most probably the quick half life of my SSRI and not me brewing on something. Just that feeling alone leads to lots of wasted evenings as I stay inactive in front of the TV rather than going for a jog or cleaning the livingroom etc. Stuff like this is what I at least want to try off SSRI no matter if I manage to quit or have to get back on the regular dose. 

I was at the doc today and told him I had already started going down slowly a few weeks from 20mg to 15 to now maybe week 4 I'm on 10mg. And the problem is instantly that I notice the weird mental effects of being on a low dosage or a dosage that is wearing out too fast. I'll get most of the usual dizziness, feverish feeling and basically it makes me want to do as little as possible. At times it feels like the ground is moving like I'm on a boat too. 

Tomorrow I'll be at a small social gathering, I really don't have social anxiety, but knowing I'm on a low dosage actually makes me wonder if I'll suddenly feel queasy due to being on low dosage or any random feeling tapering off this shit can be. I still haven't had those horrible jolts yet. So to morrow can be the classic being anxious about possibly getting anxious. I already feel and fear I will loose track of conversations or somehow my friends will go ""huh, he's weird tonight"". 

And my doc today suggested doing the tapering with 10mg every other day... he clearly hasn't been on SSRI because that was exactly what I feared he'd suggest. There even seems to be drops of SSRI you can do to micro dosage, or I misunderstood.

 My current tactic is doing 10mg today, but 5mg every 12h to avoid getting dizzy due to the low long tail, but I also feel I actually feel dizzy due to doing 10mg that actually could fall off faster than 5mg every 12h. Because I might feel the negative sides strongly 5-6h after I popped a pill, not necessarily 12h after. So it's like a higher concentration leads to a steeper fall in blood concentration (or whatever it is)  and thus a steeper fall and more a sense of ""something is messing with my head"". 

The 10mg every other day-thing seems bad as it will be pretty easy to feel when I am on a higher concentration than if it's near 48h since the last pill. So my tactic is more of splitting the pills smaller and smaller, but as I get into these lower doses I feel I am already getting withdrawal symptoms quite clearly. 

My problem now is also that just as I am getting withdrawal symptoms pretty clearly the world seems to be opening up again, and I don't want to be at work feeling all weird, tired etc. 

I dunno, any tips? Right now it feels like I have 20% of unrest lurking in the back of my mind and in my body, if that gets worse it's like drip torture. It's not super horrible right here and now, but over time it's amazingly tiresome, which is exactly what I guess we all want to get rid of."
3051,Anxiety,Severe stress because of classes,"Hello guys, this is a throwaway account as i feel like my problems are laughable at. I am 22F and going to one of the best Universities in my country (second year). I was a straight A student ever since 1st grade. Literally I have never failed a class. Now, even though my parents say otherwise, I feel like expectstions for me is really high. The bar is set so high, every grade related thing makes me want to puke or feels like my heart stops beating. I am afraid of making a mistake, this leads me to make more and it feels unacceptable. I do not have many friends, I only have my family. Please give me some advice. I do not want to live like this anymore."
3052,Anxiety,My anxiety makes it hurt even more when people are mean to me. Should this even be bugging me?,"So, my husband’s family has always been a major source of anxiety to me. It wasn’t like this at the very beginning, but over time it developed. 

He has two brothers. One of which is older and one is younger. The younger has always been nice to us, until recently. The older has always tried to compete - compare his house to ours, his relationship with his wife to us, his CATS to ours (he literally said “not as cute as our cats” the day we adopted our cats and sent him and his wife photos). They’ve made jabs and then gaslit us every time we tried to explain that what they are doing is hurtful. 

I used to try to talk to them regularly via text, but every time I would say something, no one would respond to me. Then, minutes later one of them would send a text totally unrelated to mine and start talking to each other. So I decided I would give up trying to engage now. Well, we found out they had dinners (the 4 of them - 2 brothers and wives) and other hangouts and never even invited us. That hurt both me and my husband. 

This bothers me everyday. I hate competition. I don’t want to be any part in it. My sister and I are always cheering each other on and happy for everything good that happens to the other without ever feeling resentment, so I don’t understand this behavior. I also hate being ignored and feeling like what is supposed to be my family, hates me. It hurts. It gives me tons of anxiety. It doesn’t help that my MIL is so close to them and never sees any of this because they are good at hiding their snide remarks and jabs from her. So we always end up looking like the bad guys when we decide we don’t want to be around them.

I’m not sure what I want from this post, I’m just really anxious and hurt. Plus, we are trying for a baby and I know they will be angry if we do get pregnant before them, which hurts more because I feel like we aren’t “allowed” to have one now, even though it’s all we think and talk about. It’s like we cater our lives to them and walk on eggshells to not upset them, but they still treat us like dirt. 

TLDR: “family” treats husband and I like we are competition and never includes us. Feeling hurt. 

Anyone experience something like this? How do you handle it?

It usually happens when I’m particularly anxious (I.e. about a fight with an SO, breakup, argument with family,etc).

I posted this on r/askdocs and my friend told me I should post it on here too. 

I am really panicking since I can’t breathe all the way in and the breaths I inhale are very unsatisfying. When I breathe deep it feels like my lungs are not completely full and it’s making me really anxious and uncomfortable . My chest feels tight. 
this would happen occasionally when I get really upset or really mad or anxious but it wouldn’t continue for days. The recent one started three days before when I was feeling really low and anxious and overwhelmed. I was guessing it’s the anxiety that’s causing me to have unsatisfying yawns and short breaths but now I’m worried bcz it’s been three days and I’m still struggling to take full breaths. I I DON’t have any other symptoms at all but yesterday my finger nails were a pale bluish which I found out was lack of oxygen in the body. I’m really worried, I can’t go to a hospital bcz of the lock down and the hospitals are quite far.

I did ask him like 3 days ago if something was up and he said he was just busy helping his dad because he broke his back but I feel like that still doesn’t mean he can’t send me cute bitmojis anymore when I send him them still and that he doesn’t reply back to messages any sooner than like 2-3 hours now or an hour at the least when he used to reply every 30 minutes at the longest even when he still was helping at his dads when his dad wasn’t injured. So I’m super confused if I should ask him about it again or just let things go? I mean it’s giving me mixed feelings because he still replies to texts it just takes him a lot longer now and he doesn’t send anything saying I’m cute or I miss you or anything.
3061,Anxiety,I'm anxious to talk in messages,I'm too anxious about talking in messages because I think I look fake. It's probably cause I think too much before saying something and I want to talk like others like not really caring and be relaxed but I think I look fake so I just say simple sentences when someone sends me a message and they probably think I don't like talking to them. Example on how fake I sound: person: lol why you answered so late? me: oh i didn't see your message sorry 😂 person: hmm. I think they said hmm because I sounded too fake. What do you think? Any advices?

At first i thought it was some bird, but i soon realised it was a person screaming right outside my house. Then there were two screams, then none. Nothing, no sounds at all. I live in an area that not many people would go walking up at 1:30 am, and i am freaking the fuck out. I looked out the windows everywhere but saw nothing. Wtf"
3064,Anxiety,Bizarre Anxiety Symptom?,"So, as I’m sure most of are, I’m having a seriously hard time coping with my anxiety while being at home 24/7. I was asked to stay home because I had a sinus infection and since a lot of my anxiety is health related, that’s when I started feeling stressed through the day. I was them given a temporary lay off and things have gotten quite a bit worse. I’m fact, I’ve never felt so out of control mentally. My eyes don’t focus, my mind races all the time, my shoulders and neck feel limp periodically, and I seem to constantly be either stressed or panicked.

Last night I fell asleep on the couch facing my TV and I started to have a dream that I was on my phone in the exact position I fell asleep in. It was blurry and very quick because it spooked me and I woke up. It happened again this morning. I woke up with an adrenaline rush around 7:40 and my body felt panicked but my mind didn’t seem to care and I tried falling back asleep and had these types of dreams again. It’s like I’m half asleep and half awake at the same time. 

Has anyone else experienced this? 

P.s I took 2mg of Ativan almost 30 hours before the first time it happened."

3070,Anxiety,I (F24) can't stop having panic attacks whenever my boyfriend mentions other girls. Anyone else get this? How do you make it stop?,"I've been diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. Last year, my mom revealed to me the reason she and my father got divorced was because he was having this affair and the whole thing played out very nasty.

Ever since she told me, I've been getting panic attacks whenever my boyfriend mentions another girl. We've been together for 6 years and he's never done anything to make me not trust him, we have a fantastic relationship, and I love him to pieces.

But, for example, he mentioned he talked to a girl at work (something that would normally never bother me) and I got lightheaded and felt like I was spinning, I was sick to my stomach, and it felt like my mouth was glued shut. It lasts for easily 20 minutes and happens every time, over the slightest mention.

Although he knows about my parents affair and my diagnosis, I don't want him to think I don't trust him because I do. And I don't want to ask him to not talk about other girls because they are obviously going to be a part of his life and I don't want him to feel like he has to walk on eggshells in our conversations. I've tried using the grounding techniques I was taught by my doctor, but they don't work. 

Does anyone else have this problem? And if so, how do you and your partner make it work? How can I make it stop?"

Wading through a 2 week period of symptoms would suck, but i know that my heart would be pounding the entire time which would make it a lot worse. And elevated blood pressure (which goes along with my anxiety) is a big factor in fatal cases. Has there been any research about taking xanax while infected? Anyone know if this would be safe or if taking xanax would do more harm than good?"

3073,Anxiety,Is it sage to split Citalopram?,"My doc gave me 10mg pills, told me to start with cutting the pill in half or even quarters. He mentioned “its ok even if the pill are uneven sizes”.

Well the first day I split the pill I felt really tired, when I ate the other half the next day I felt this sudden nervous energy, third day I split a new pill and I felt tired, when I ate the other half the next day I felt this nervous energy again.

It seems as if when I take a fresh pill and take a half it makes me tired. When I take the next half the following day it gives me nervous energy and jitters. What could this be? Does having a pill cut in half and leaving it stored affect its potency? My appointment isnt until next week so I can’t tell my doc yet."

3075,Anxiety,Anyone else afraid of needles but not because they’re needles?,"I need to get a shot. I used to be fascinated by needles, blood taken out, gore, etc. but, I’ve always had a huge fair of loss of control AKA fainting. I never have fainted. Getting a shot, I never felt scared or light headed. In one of my classes 2 years ago we learned about how seeing injury/blood/getting a shot commonly makes people faint. Well. Good thing I was up to date on vaccines because I’ve been avoiding them since. I’m better with blood now and but still try to avoid other people’s injuries at times.

I am terrified of passing out or getting close to it while getting this vaccine. Also, my panic attacks around fainting are the WORST and I already know I’ll look like an idiot fidgeting, panicking, pacing, etc. 

Has anyone gone through something similar? If I or family members have never fainted from getting a shot, would I not too? Thanks."
3076,Anxiety,Getting a lot of anxiety about defacing a bible 6 years ago.,"I’m not religious. When I was 14/15 I was on a school trip and my roomies and I put our social media handles written on pages of the bible. 

It was a cheap motel and the bible was one of the basic bibles that are often in motel rooms. 

It was a stupid move, I know. Every year I get such horrible anxiety about how what if someone happens to read through it and out ya? I’ve even considered changing my username so that I can’t be found but part of me feels like I deserve it. 

If this gets out I could get in such horrible trouble because I want to work in schools one day.

3083,Anxiety,Dealing with physical symptoms of anxiety: A (very long) story time.,"Hi all,

I'm writing this for future people who may stumble across this thread in a search result. Threads like this helped me in some way, so this is my way of giving back. A lot of this will seem discombobulated, but I'm not proofreading this.

Around 4 years ago, I woke up one day with a very strange symptom. I don't know how to describe it other than a ""waviness vertigo"". Essentially, it feels like the earth is moving up and down slowly. This feeling was 24/7. Sometimes, it will feel like its dropping very quickly. At this point, I was an undergrad. When I noticed it wasn't going away, it consumed my whole life. I couldn't focus in classes. The thought of having this forever caused some dark thoughts to rush to my head. I started googling symptoms. Was 100% convinced I had a brain tumor.

I've always had anxiety issues. Before this, I had symptoms which had a similar progression. For example, in high school, I took ibuprofen when I got headaches. It always worked. When one day, it didn't go away with ibuprofen, the headache persisted for months. All of my doctors told me it was physical symptoms produced by anxiety. Eventually, my doctor caved, and ordered a brain scan. It came back normal. A few weeks later, the headache subsided. I thought to myself, man, maybe it was anxiety after all.

Sorry for the tangent. Back to this ""episode"" in undergrad. My point is, when you have an anxiety disorder, the next time a similar thing happens, all logic goes out the window. I went to every doctor imaginable. Everything came back normal. This consumed my life. I thought, once again, I had a brain tumor. For a long time, my therapist encouraged me to try medication, but I refused for the longest time. When I hit rock bottom, I thought to myself, what do I have to lose? I was terrified, but I finally took that first dose of 25 mg of Zoloft. Of course, with that small of a dose, nothing changed. I had to drop the semester and go home because I could not function in school. There's so many more stories I could tell, but they are quite personal and involve family. All I can say is, I'm grateful I had such a supportive family throughout this ordeal.

When I got home, a few weeks went by and things still were not better. I broke down one day and demanded another brain scan. We went to the ER, and they obliged. Once again, shocker, no brain tumor. I was temporarily relieved from the stress. But the symptom was still there and the feeling of dread came right back. As this was all happening, I was slowly increasing my medication. Eventually I got to 100 mg of Zoloft, which is a pretty standard dose. Because I was so bored at home, I started getting out of bed and playing League of Legends. The turnaround here was when I noticed I didn't feel anything when I started playing, because I was so focused on the game. I think the medication helped me think in a more rational mindset. I thought to myself, it suddenly goes away when I play a video game? I didn't know League was a cure for the other things I thought I had like MS. Of course it isn't, but this change in my thought patterns was helping tremendously. Within weeks, I was 100% back to normal. I couldn't wait to go back to school! I eventually finished undergrad, and the symptom subsided for 4 years. Keep in mind, I was still taking 100 mg of Zoloft every day.

Fast forward to September 2019. A few months prior, I moved across the country to pursue grad school. I was trying to go to sleep one night, when all of a sudden, that feeling of ""waviness"" came back. I couldn't believe it. It was almost 4 years to the exact date when the other episode started. I tried convincing myself that it was because I was taking a different manufacturers generic Zoloft. When I switched back to the original manufacturer, it still persisted. I was devastated. When I wasn't forced to do work with classmates, or go to class, I stayed in bed almost all the time. My appetite became non-existent. I could not believe this was happening again. I was terrified to go out, because I was scared of falling or something? I don't know. My psychiatrist recommended I up my medication. I obliged, first going to 150 mg. This is now getting into the higher doses of Zoloft. First thing I noticed was a massive increase in appetite, which wasn't a bad side-effect in my case. Unlike the last time this happened, I never missed a single class. My grades didn't slip. I powered through it, unlike in undergrad 4 years ago. But mentally, it was taking its toll. Dark thoughts started to invade my brain again. I wouldn't say I was suicidal, it was more like, if a car ran me over right now, I wouldn't care, you know? After forcing myself to go to class, go out with friends, go to events, etc, I started to become more confident. Yeah the symptoms were still there, but I could at least function. However, I really wanted to destroy this waviness. My doctor upped my Zoloft to 200 mg, which is the max recommended dose for anxiety (I think you can go higher for treatment of OCD.)

The symptoms still persisted 7 months later. I would periodically google symptoms. Started to convince myself I had Menieres Disease (even though I had no hearing loss, lol.) Got sad again, because it's incurable. I finished classes, and quarantine started. I had all the time in the world, which for someone like me, is both a blessing and a curse. However, every time something like this happens to me, I learn a little bit from the last experience. I knew I couldn't just stay in bed all the time. When there's nothing else on your mind, your brain will invent something for you. And for someone with an anxiety disorder, it's usually destructive. So I started getting back into hiking. I only drank socially, very little prior to this. But I figured I would get into craft beer, so I started bringing beer up with me up the hikes. When I got to the top, I would treat myself with a beer. Before I say the next part, I just want to put a disclaimer: I am not recommending treating anxiety with alcohol. I don't drink more than a pint at one time, unless drinking out with friends, which is rare. I also try to drink not more than once every two days. Anyways, when I would finish my pint and get buzzed, I was so fucking happy. I felt like the person I should be. Just enjoying life. That feeling of waviness/dizziness? Yeah, totally gone. Didn't even come into my mind. You know what alcohol does? It has anti-anxiety properties. Once again, I am not advocating treating anxiety disorders with alcohol. That would be very stupid. However, it helped me put two and two together. Alcohol led to a complete elimination of the waviness, at least until it wore off. Like how League of Legends did the same for me 4 years ago, drinking helped my thinking become more rational. The symptoms became less and less apparent after this experience. They are still there, but much less intense, and not 24/7 as before. I feel like I got my life back. I never saw a single doctor throughout this ordeal (except my psychiatrist), so I guess I pat myself on the back for that.

When I began to realize this was certainly caused by severe anxiety, I started to notice other patterns in my behavior that were caused by anxiety, but always thought were normal. For example, when walking down the street, I always have to look back because I think the person I just walked by has a knife, and will turn around and try to kill me because he/she is crazy. Of course, this is not rational thinking. Another thing is, always thinking that people are looking at me in a large setting, like a supermarket. Once again, common in anxiety, but not rational. But this is how my brain is wired. And you know what? That's OK. I definitely need to work on these thoughts. The one regret I have is not seeing a therapist throughout this, but that is my next step in my journey.

In closing, here's a few key tips I have:

1. Don't be scared of medication. I was that person who was absolutely terrified of side-effects. However, I had zero negative side-effects from Zoloft, even at a high dose of 200 mg. As long as you start small and titrate slowly, side-effects should be minimal. But everyone is different!
2. DO NOT GOOGLE SYMPTOMS. This is 100% the worst thing you can do. Every doctor will tell you this. They know you and the diseases you think you have a lot more than you. Listen to them instead of WebMD.
3. Try to force yourself outside your comfort zone, and do some activity that doesn't involve sitting in bed. It will be incredibly tough at first. You won't want to do it anymore. But you must persist. Doing nothing will only cause you to be trapped in your own feelings. And feelings lie.

Sorry if this is difficult to read because of the stream-of-consciousness-like writing, but I had to get this off my chest."
