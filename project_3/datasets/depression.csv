0,depression,what do i do? i feel lost,"I dont know what to do. Im in college studying computer science and it all just feels too much. I dont want to participate in life. I just want to play games with my friends, and exist without reason. I dont want to have to be worth something. I dont want to have to do all these things thrust upon me. I dont want to pay money to learn things. I don't want to have to work to justify my existence. I miss my hometown. I want to feel full and happy. Not empty and hopeless.

 I dont even know if this is the right place to post this, but i want solutions not workarounds. I dont want to find ways to cope with the problems, i need answers to dissolve the problems. Im not suicidal, but i do not feel when i do things I do not want to. I wish i could get away from it all."

3,depression,Am I weak if I ask for help?,"(19) I'm not sure why I'm doing this, maybe I just need some advice or something  I guess, but I just feel so weak all the time not just physically but even my brain is being stretched to its limits, I don't cry or really even smile I don't feel much of anything, and I wish I had someone to talk to personally instead of crying to reddit for help, and if I did I probably would it's just idk I'm just so done, with everything, I'm not a good person, I'm not smart or fun to be around, hell that's probably why I don't have any real friends anymore, why everyone gives me the cold shoulder, am I just weak for not being able to handle my emotions on my own, is it because I'm not strong enough that I let all this slip, I just wish it would stop, to fall asleep and never wake up, idk what I want anymore, I just want it all to end, all the intrusive thoughts, all the shitty memories, I just want to feel again, I hate being so cold and empty inside, I post on my page but that just makes I worse, I get all the attention someone could ask for, but it's just not the same, all these people cheating on their S/O to talk to me and I love posting but when I'm the main cause for relationships to end it just hurts even more, I didn't mean for it to happen, I didn't know, I just wanted to make people happy because I couldn't make myself happy, but I feel like I'm doing it all wrong, I'm still not happy in fact I feel even worse, I didn't ask for this, I just wanted to be happy, why is happiness so hard to find, I'd even settle for contentment, but even that's so far out of reach, and idek if I'll post this because now I'll make people worry, I'll make people question me and I don't want that I just don't know what I want anymore, everyday is just gets harder and harder and idk what to do, idk anymore just please make it stop, make it all stop."
4,depression,I’m surly destined to be alone so I’m going to commit suicide tonight fully.,"Drinking a shit ton of alcohol does the trick Im going to commit suicide by hanging it’s over Im 19 I promised myself to see how it will get better within the future but it’s just gotten worse I don’t know anymore this is it I’m going to kill myself tomorrow by hanging or a cliff I know wrote and told my family and so on about this I’m just really done. I’m so alone just existing for the sake of it the loneliness is eating me up I can’t seem to look at myself and feel useful. I feel like this world has nothing for me. It’s like nothing is waiting for me in the future. I don’t want to survive this time I really don’t I rather best be dead and observe everyone live there life and be happy. I hate myself and never want to be alive again. Idk who will find this but thanks for being in my life. I've also been feeling extremely suicidal lately, I can't take this total isolation anymore. Even if I have an opportunity to talk to someone at all, I can barely even manage to form a sentence. Never mind a girl. Stutter, stutter fkn stutter. Even if I have something in mind I find it so difficult to actually say it. Who on earth would have the patience to listen to me? Even if I tried to talk to someone how could they ever be attracted to me? I can't even talk to them properly.

I'm so crippled with anxiety I can't even go outside or talk to someone online anymore. Sure I'll comment here and there, but I can't actually have a conversation or form any kind of friendship and relationship.
Goodbye.

Have to say thanks to the people who constantly reached out to me and on posts these couple of weeks it did seem like I was not taking it in but I sure did that’s why I was and am still here not anymore now."

6,depression,Nothing,"I need nothing. I want there to be a place where nothing can be experienced. Where nothing can be discussed. I'm staring into my sheets wishing I was nothing. ""Nothing"" is subjective. You never have nothing in this life. Anyone can experience nothingness at any time, but there is never just nothingness. It's any oxymoron, you need something to have nothing. So what is nothing and why do I feel like need it. Have I already obtained nothing? Everything is in my grasp yet I feel nothing. Am I dwelling on nothingness to long? Is there something I am after that I can't yet put into words? I feel I am nothing. I feel I need nothing. So what is it?

I have no drive to do anything. I have no interests.I’m tired of having to put on this stupid fucking smile everyday. I’m just living day to day waiting for it to be over. I don’t even cry anymore. Nothing affects me or gets me excited. I’ve done drugs, drank alcohol, but I still felt nothing. I went and made more friends thinking it would help, but now I’m just stuck with them. I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m at the point of giving up."
8,depression,Looking for reasons to live,"Basically just title. I want good reasons to keep on living and trying in life that my brain won’t immediately reject with negative self talk. I feel like everybody around me knows something I don’t know about the purpose of living and trying so hard to achieve.

For context I am bipolar and in college. I feel a depressive episode creeping up on me. Every day seems to give me less and less “satisfaction” or whatever you want to call it. Having intrusive thoughts about wanting to just give it all up and just stop struggling. I don’t plan on acting on anything, I have never attempted before.

So, what do you tell yourself when your brain comes up short on reasons to live? What reasons do you have that your brain can’t argue with?

Thanks"

11,depression,Stuck in a rut,"This is more of a vent than anything. I was recently diagnosed with clinical depression, but have had it for about 15 years. It has impacted every aspect of my life and I am at a point now where I am just numb and exhausted. Every attempt to get myself out of this rut has failed miserably. Friends don't reach out and don't respond and act extremely distant and inconsistent. Work is giving me major imposter syndrome. I found out that I have cancer in my genetics. I lost a parent to it several years ago. I try so hard to put up a front that I am fine and going about life just as anyone else, but it is like climbing Everest to get through each day. I've tried many therapists who just hand me worksheets as a way of giving me advice. Meds made me ill. I'm not even sure where to turn or what to do anymore because nothing gives me an iota of happiness, not even my hobbies. I am the loneliest I have ever been in my life. I'm at a loss. I don't want to be like this but have no clue what to do to help myself. I feel stuck."
12,depression,I genuinely want to be a good person but don't know how,"Before anyone hits me with the ""good and bad don't truly exist"" I know that. But I can still try to be better. I can still try to do good actions and be defined by that. But I don't know what those are. I don't know how to benefit others. I don't actually care what others think of me it's weird, I only care if I feel like I'm being a good person. Maybe that is my problem. I don't care what other people think. I want to help people, but nobody ever taught me how to be a good friend and give good advice. Nobody taught me how to be a help to others. I can't figure it out for myself, I'm not smart. Maybe I do care what others think since I'm asking you all this but I just want to know how I can become a good person."

15,depression,I feel like I don't want to get better,"made this account because I needed to vent and didn't think it would be fair to say it to friends or family

I'm in my mid-20s and have been struggling with depression since I was a teenager. I know exactly what the reason is, too. it's embarrassing how obvious it is 

my father was an abusive alcoholic. when I was about 15 my parents separated. he's made no effort to stay in my life, and while I didn't particularly want him around (he was abusive, after all), it hurts that he doesn't seem to particularly *want* to be around. I was his child, but he was fine never seeing me again. he was my father, and he just...didn't care about me very much 

my mother is wonderful, but it felt like she stopped wanting to *be* a mother around the time of the divorce. I've had to be her emotional support so, so often and hide my feelings so as to not upset her. it feels like she needed me to be a peer for her to lean on, and I understand that to an extent - she had a traumatic upbringing, and the divorce was because she had an abusive husband - but it's painful to feel like both of your parents decided they didn't want to take care of you anymore

I have no extended family. no one on my father's side has stayed in touch and my mother was estranged from her own family, so that makes things hard, too. it makes me feel resentful towards my friends, sometimes. they all have aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents they can turn to. even if their relationships are sometimes complicated, when it comes down to it, it feels like everyone else has people who want to take care of them, even if they're bad at it 

now that I'm an adult, I live very independently. as in, alone. I struggle to make friends in real life, although I do have people that I talk to online. it's hard to open up. this is the embarrassing part, because I can see exactly what led me to feel this way. I was emotionally abandoned and it fucked me up; now there's a part of me that's convinced I'm inherently unlovable no matter what I do

I feel ugly, stupid, annoying. I feel boring. I can't talk to people because I'm convinced I'll say the wrong thing and put them off. I'm scared to spend time with people because I'm convinced they'll regret it. I feel like I have to apologize for any and everything I say or do, but that apologizing is annoying too, so I can't. I just have to keep myself as quiet and unobtrusive as possible so that I'm not burdening anyone with my existence. I'm constantly afraid that the people who say they care about me will change their minds. I don't feel capable of trusting that they mean it; I'm always waiting for the other shoe to drop 

I hate myself. I feel as though I have no right to be alive. I haven't done anything to ""earn"" what I take from others. I'm not worth the trouble I cause anyone. but I want to be loved. I want to be cared about. I want to be loved and cared about so much that even I will believe it. I want someone I can trust won't go away

everyone says you have to love yourself first. you can't depend on others for your self-worth, and nobody can ""love"" my depression away. I know that. but sometimes I really resent that

I hate taking care of myself. I hate trying to love myself. I've spent so much of my life feeling like nobody wanted to take care of me - that I wasn't ""worth"" it. trying to force myself to do it feels unfair. I mean, why should I have to? why didn't my parents want to? why didn't my family want to? if I'm the only person who will ever do this, is there even any point? do I really want to be alive if I have to feel so forgotten and unnecessary the entire time? no amount of self-talk seems to help. in the end, it always comes back to ""you have to do this for yourself because you aren't worth it to anybody else""

I've seen tons of resources about loving yourself. I have no idea how to *want* to love yourself"
16,depression,feeling like garbage,"I have been depressed since I was a child. I'm currently 21, and have no aspirations in life. I hate myself so much that I feel like I am beyond repair. I have been somewhat consistently medicated starting around my preteen years. Along with seeing a therapist and occasionally government services. I really wish I could just kill myself without hurting the ones I care about. I am so unhappy. So unhappy, I just wish I could be okay just for a month. I wish I wasn't in constant pain. I wish I wasn't scared of dying. I am so beyond stressed because my family has been having a lot more issues than usual and my memory has definitely been reflecting that. All I want in life is to be happy and to have a pretty garden I can tend to. It's usually that I don't want to die but I just don't want to live, but life has just feel so overwhelming. I've been finding it so hard to even do the little things that make me happy. Sorry this post is all over the place I just feel like I have no one to talk to as I don't want to burden my other friends who also deal with mental illness and I don't have therapy until a couple of days and journaling has been only doing so much lately."
17,depression,I'm either gonna attempt to kill myself or have a psychotic episode.,[removed]
18,depression,i have a serious confidence problem,"I've always tried to be as knowledgeable as possible to compensate for my stupidity, but now that I have no energy to study or even get out of bed, I'm starting to think that I'm closer to an amoeba than a human.

When I was little I was a narcissistic prick who thought everyone was more stupid than me, but now it's quite the opposite.

I can't think of anything I'm good at. I'm even terrible in those things I've spent a lot of time on in the past. As if my practice meant absolutely nothing.

You might say: ""It's just because you left them for so long, you simply need to practice a little more to get back to where you were"", but I have no motivation to get back into anything.

Right now I'm even struggling writing this vent because I'm not sure what words to use or if my sentences are correct and even when I'll ultimately post this I won't be sure it's going to be correct.

I don't think I'll accomplish anything in life at this point.

I keep asking myself if it is even worth living anymore, but in all honesty: I don't think I'm even capable to end it.

For now I'll just sleep in my bed trying to dream something nice.

Doubt anyone will read this, but I need to get it out of my system."
19,depression,I’m spiraling and I can’t get help.,"I have a history of depression, since I was probably six years old. I’m not the person you would ever think would have mental issues- I am a married mom who honestly is so happy in her family situation. I can honestly say they are the *only* bright spot in my life. All that aside- I’m not ok.

I feel like I’m so desperate for a connection that I flirt with/hit on every person I interact with. I’m scared to get a male therapist, because I’m afraid that I will try to seduce them. My self-worth is literally trash. I’m not suicidal. At any time a therapist or a professional asked me what keeps me going, the answer is because I don’t want to disappoint the people around me. I couldn’t give a fuck about myself, I just don’t want people around me to be sad or disappointed. 

ALLLLLLL to the reason I posted this. I’ve finally bit the bullet and decided to get therapy, so I reached out to betterhelp. After five or six different therapist that I ruled out for different reasons, I finally found one that I felt like aligned with me and my situation. Well, I just got a message from her. She wanted to let me know that my “issues” are too much, and she advised that I should only have in person therapy, and should never be helped via telehealth.
She let me know that she contacted betterhealth to close my account, and I would subsequently be refunded.

I am so humiliated, and I have never felt like more of a burden in my entire life. if I had the ability to do in person therapy, I would have. I don’t have that option, which is why I chose an online therapy option. 

I don’t know what to do. I literally want to disappear. I have never felt more like a burden. 

Currently I am the sole provider for my children, so my options are limited."

22,depression,I don't like myself,What do you do with this feeling. I can't be sad or angry. I can't be anything. I can't feel the people around me or the music I listen to. I am just disconnected with reality. I wish I wasn't here. All I can do is distract myself for the moment but then it eats at me subconsciously
23,depression,Life is shit,I have tried to change my life my whole life and maybe for a few years I had the strength to fight what was set for me. I remember being 8 years old with the thought In my head I’m a grmlin I won’t go to heaven or hell I’m a useless trash used by god or the devil I’m not sure. But I remember having these dreams as a kid and kids don’t think these things. I’m convinced I am some henchmen in this life. Let’s start at the beginning I was born to a prostitute mom never new my dad. Was raised by my sisters dad raped from 3 to 8. I was born ugly. My mom couldn’t take care of herself she provided roof and food and did the best she could. My sisters and I were left alone for days at a time. No lights or heat. My mom died when I was 19 been on my own ever since. I grew up ungrateful and a horrible human. I tried for years to fight it and I had strength for a long time but it’s gone. I never had friends. I moved every year to a new house. And never stayed more than a year in a school. I ate in the bathroom at school and not a soul ever reached out to see if I was ok. No teacher ever asked me if I was alright. And I ate my free lunch on the toilet crying. I never had a bf. I grew up got one and was abused bc I had no self love. I was never pretty enough no matter what I did and I tried everything possible to change it. I’ve been homeless and slept on the ground. I’ve slept in my car. And I try so so so hard to change my life but no matter what I do something happens and I have no more fight in me. I really wish I would die. I’ve only been here 30 years and I look 100. The relationships I have everyone and I’ve tried different types thinking it was who I was choosing have always always abused and bullied me bc I wasn’t good enough and I was too ugly. I was made fun of for everything I did and one person two peiple ok but after two you really know the problem is you. I just am ugly horrible trash that is floating in this world to absorb shit. I am shit I guess
24,depression,"drunk, confused, and depressed?","I dunno, I'm posting here cuz I think I'm having an episode but it's hard to tell through all the booze. Im so touch starved and lonely in the presence of loving people that I just don't know what to feel anymore. I have moments where the fog clears and I realize how truly depressed I really am, but it's like I'm pretending so well I fool myself sometimes. Sometimes I feel fine and normal, and other times, like rn, I feel like I'm a hopeless messa nd it's only a matter of time.before I'm dead. I dunno... Anyone wanna talk?

My teacher wants us to submit them online and scan/take a picture of each document. Im so tired i can’t even do something as simple as scanning a document. I wish I was dead already.  As a result i’m turning them in late. I’m so pathetic compared to the rest of my peers who consistently get their work done.

Whenever i feel good i gotta fall so hard and i want to get better but i’m prolly neurotic or some shit lol but i don’t even trust myself enough to validate how i feel

30,depression,Sleeping too much. Advice?,"Background: Been diagnosed with depression, anxiety disorder and OCD. Been on Citalopram 20mg for the past 2 years. That helps with the anxiety and OCD a lot, but it makes me sleepy.

For the past year or so i've been occasionally suffering with Hypersomnia = sleeping too much. This fall it has caused me a lot of problems. For example, i can sleep for 14 hours, then be awake for 5 hours until i feel super tired again. I go for ""a nap"" and sleep another 10-14 hours. And then i'm just stuck in this cycle for weeks. I feel fatigued all the time, like i can't even sit on my computer without getting tired.

I've been prescribed Bupropion in the past. It helped for one week, then the stimulating effect weaned off and all that was left was my brain going too fast and then i couldn't fall asleep at all. It made me feel psychotic at night.

Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you come over it? I don't want to sleep my life away..."

I grew up in a cult and lost my whole world of people and everything and am now 17 and missed out on my entire childhood. I’ll never get to know what it’s like to be a teen. I’ve tried so damn hard to get friends, take every opportunity but I still feel so depressed. I’ve made some connections this semester (doing a college program offered by my state) and have done a couple more things with people but still don’t have that community, those friends that you don’t worry about if they like you or not, the ones who you know value you as much as you do to you. My whole childhood I was did all the work in my friendships and right now in my life I still feel like I give people more then what I receive generally and that’s hard. I want to be appreciated and loved, I want my group of friends who I go to watch movies with. I’m an outsider who knows some people but I don’t have that connection. Doesn’t help that there was this guy that I liked (and still do) who I thought liked me back but turns out he’s asexual. Also worries me cause he used to take more initiative with me but now never checks in on me or asks to hang out. Worst part is I can’t get over him and feel like I’ll never get an opportunity like this again or at least be a teenager like this. I’m just really depressed and do have mental health issues but just feeling very crummy about this tonight. Yes I’m gay fuck off. I feel so sentimental, it feels like a dream reality and I don’t know I am so nostalgic and feel out of this world. Please universe help me.

34,depression,Life just doesn’t have that spark anymore,"I’ve been depressed for years, with the depression varying greatly depending on the era. I’ve also been looking back at 2020 and how much has happened in that year globally. How many memes, how much destruction, how much international attention certain things received, etc. At this moment right now, it feels like nothing big is happening, and hasn’t happened for like 9 months. My personal life hasn’t seen much surprise and ambition either, and it’s been like that for months. Life all around just feels stale. Like I’m still alive for no real reason. Like the show is over. I just can’t take it anymore. 

I guess my point is I want big things to happen again. Whether internationally or personally."

36,depression,The winds that blow South,"I have been for over an year, all I see is dreary and lack of affable opportunities. I am not a native, I am a migrant here from North. I eat, sleep and get through the day. Sometimes I play a part, sometimes I play many. I am no longer able to recognise the man I come across in the mirror, sometimes I am myself, and those times I struggle socially.

They ask me nothing, I am always all ears. I never speak. When I do I'm so apparent. But that apparentness is apparentless, they never acknowledge me or my feelings adequately.

I have lost the ability to form meaningful relationships with women. I have lost my ability to form a romantic relationship. My past truama still haunts me. I am 21 and lost. Maybe I'll get out and be better, maybe it's not that bad. But each day I'm struggling to get out of my bed.

My dreams are better than my real life. And they wonder why I don't wake up on time. Going to uni is such a drag, the burden that weighs on me crushes my windpipe, I sometimes hope it really would. I can not be here any longer."

41,depression,I don’t understand how people care about life,"I don’t understand how people find the motivation to care about life. I’m 25 and I’ve been sitting on my ass for 4 years avoiding working. I have no energy to do anything unless it’s a spur of the moment thing that involves 98% fun and less than 2% work (like watching YouTube, playing video games, watching tv). In the past year I have quit 6 jobs after being there for less than a week. I have never kept a job for longer than a week other than Doordash, which I’m able to continue doing because I can set my own schedule. I’ll go a week or two without dashing at all, and then dash for a couple days nonstop when I need money. I say I want a relationship but I never put in any work to have one. I have ZERO social life, I haven’t been to a social event in 3-4 years, and even then if I went to one I’d leave after 5 minutes because the social situation made me uncomfortable. I get nervous and sweaty just from going to a restaurant or store. And the worst part is I don’t WANT to get better. I don’t want to work. I don’t want to socialize. I just want a girlfriend, money, to be able to live how I want..basically I want the end result without putting in the work and I have no clue how to change that. It’s so deeply in me to not want to work, I feel it with every fiber of my being. When I tell this to my family they just don’t understand. I lie to my family and say I have a job just so that they’ll continue helping me pay for things I need and so that they want constantly pester me about needing to get a life. I understand people who commit crimes and hurt people more than I understand people who work and socialize and try in life."

44,depression,Art and limbo,"I'm out of options. I've reached what feels like a guarantee that nothing will change for the better from here on out.

Imagine this. If you went to a therapist, because you're suicidal, because say you lost your arms and can't use them, what will they do? They'll try working you around it. Getting you to just live with it, to cope with it. They can't make your arms come back.

It's a drastic comparison, but it still works. You can picture this with my art pains.

About two and a half years now, this same thing has haunted me. And as much as I love talking about it, I'll admit it for once that this is merely the straw that broke the camel's back. I already tried shooting myself in 2016. And I failed.

It's the single biggest regret of my entire life. I could've been nonexistent by now. I wouldn't have had to experience an ounce of the envy. I wouldn't have had to find a version of myself who didn't fail in every aspect. I wouldn't have had to witness my ideas and desires already executed and perfected. I wouldn't have had to end up slamming my head into walls out of the frustration, the anguish, and the emptiness it all brought onto me from then on.

I have no passion, and I can't force it either. So I can't enjoy the process. So I won't just do it, and I won't go anywhere.

It's like the universe is looking me dead in the eyes, and asking. ""Why haven't you necked yourself yet?""

Because I'm scared. It's because I'm scared. No amount of being pissed off and resentful of the universe for existing will make me feel even slightly comfortable or entitled to something that isn't just more bullshit waiting patiently on the other side.

Even if I somehow pushed through this passion barrier of mine, it'd be years of work before any of it looked tolerable. My ideas can't even be considered my own anymore. And awful free-time lacking adult life is kicking in, in a world that already provoked a suicide attempt out of me before any of this art crap, way back when I was just 14.

I'll say it yet again. Everything I should've been is already out there. And I'm not exactly puncturing a hole in the art spectrum with my death, or just lack of contribution.

I'll never write anything worth reading. I'll never compose anything worth listening. I'll never draw anything worth witnessing. I'll never do anything worth acknowledging.

And sure, not if I'm dead. And if I'm gonna die anyways, why not try? So I tried.

I tried once, it felt awful. Soul-draining, tiring. I ended up going nowhere, and haven't touched drawing for 8 months now.

Then I tried again, something else. Doesn't work, my circumstances forbid it. Probably wouldn't have gone anywhere anyways.

And then I tried again, something else.

""dime-a-dozen""

""boring""

And I couldn't agree more. That's just what happens when I try to do anything. Not like it would've gone anywhere in the end, it depended on me being capable of art, but I'm just a complete failure.

Everything sucks. I hate it all. Nothing interests me anymore.

My only dreams are perpetual infeasibilities.

The days of having free time and getting enough sleep to make waking up worth it are long gone.

I wish my dad loved my mom.

I don't want to die. I don't want to do anything anymore.

I just wish I never existed."
45,depression,How to university/college with shite mental health?,"Basically i have no energy to do anything but sleep. I literally spent the entire weekend sleeping. IM 10 weeks behind on content and have 3 finals coming up in 30 days yet i cant bring myself to study at all. I procrastinate every single thing. It was 50 days 3 weeks ago but in the blink of an eye i wasted 3 weeks just like that. My gpa is already shit and this is my last chance to improve it. I also need to learn coding in 3 weeks and code a simple game.

Im so lost. i skip lessons and dont go to campus. I got no friends or money. Sleeping helps me escape for a brief period of time. I have a report that is due in about 40 hours that i had 3 weeks to work on but i havent started jackshit. Seeing people on campus being happy and enjoying the ebst times of their lives gives me so much anxiety and that is why i stopped going to campuis. I thought this year 2 would be different but im repeating what i did in year 1 again and again. I hate my major and cannot change it. my brain just feels like it is in a permanent brain rot. 

Please what do i do."
46,depression,My own mother,My own fucking mother makes me want to kill myself at times. She lies and does me so fucking wrong. I’ve made mistakes in life but why does she have to keep bringing it up. Why can’t I ever just be good enough. She has messed me up so bad I can’t even find a job and I’m 26 living at home. I’ve had to grow up bullied and treated wrong by everyone. People who we’re supposed to be friends stole from me. I went all through school wanting friends and to just be happy. In college I just kept getting bullied and then having to go home to more abuse. Even my professors treated me bad. I don’t feel like I have a purpose in life. Everything I ever do fails. I try my hardest every fucking day just to fail. It’s so bad I play games and make goals in the game to try to feel like I’m good at something just to never reach the goals I set. I just want to feel like I’m meant for something.

53,depression,Scared to be completely alone,"I’ve been living and working in another country for the past 13 years. Im 38 years to be soon, and newly single, just out of a toxic relationship. I only have my mother, who’s always been a single mother. No siblings, no new partner, no kids. Im scared to hell of being completely alone when my mother goes. I feel so depressed, no energy, no ambition, feels like there’s no future. I wonder what it’s like to stay home without a job until all of my savings are gone, and then end my life after I become completely alone"
54,depression,My friend needs help and idk what to do,"Hi guys. Here is some background. Me and my floor mate are first years in college. We are both engineering majors but different majors but tons of overlap so we have similar classes. Also, we are both bs/ms students. What does this mean? We are already committed to grad school and we need to maintain a 3.4 (all As and A-s for the most part). We are supposed to finish what takes most people 12 semesters in 7 plus an internship or two. Also we r both ahead of plan as we r in 2nd year classes some and next semester all 2nd year classes. 

Now I got lucky this semester. I got the best proffessors and classes. My floor mate on the other hand got one of the hardest math professors ever. And he’s a smart guy. He got an 83 on the recent test when the class average was a 63. This shows u how hard this professor is. But it’s not only this class. He has another like it. Anyway, he isn’t keeping up that 3.4 for now but I think he can get it eventually. Regardless, it’s rocking him hard. No matter how much work he puts in, he just keeps getting beat down. We only chose this college because of this program so now it’s seeming like a distant dream. 

Today I found out that he is being put on anti depression medication but I don’t think that’s going to fix anything. He told me a lot that no one else knows and I don’t want to tell them because then I won’t know if something more serious happens cause he might not trust me. I fear for him and I don’t know what to do"
55,depression,how do people live,"I hate my flat. I look for work, but pay is so low that the best i could hope for is to work to 70 to buy a shithole comparable to the shithole i currently rent from a shit tier hoa. Ohhh but you have to start somewhere - except my cv isnt blank, i had shit tier jobs when i was younger. Ohhh why dont you go back to studying - except i have qualifications that are apparently worthless and any further study stops my benefit unless i want to commit to 8 years of study to get an undergrad that'll start me off on a shit wage anyway and still be trapped in the same dilema. Life just doesnt seem worth living. The monotony is and idea of being trapped in this flat until i die just makes me want to die faster. It's a situation that just feels impossible to escape. If it wasnt for my cat i wouldnt get out of bed, most likely wouldnt still be here, but im considering giving her up, can barely scrape the motivation to look after myself"
56,depression,Does therapy help,Just wondering if therapy even does anything been on antidepressants for around a year now even had my dose made higher three times but they still don’t work I just want a way to feel something again
57,depression,How do I stop the cycle?,I have been super depressed for about 4 years and only mildly depressed before that. But the decisions I make I can see why I am depressed. I can’t tell if I make myself depressed or I make bad decisions because I am depressed. Where do you get the willpower from to change after its been so long and your life is so bad that even the smallest things seem so big to change? I can’t get out of the cycle.
58,depression,Confused and lost,"Is it just me or does anyone else feel more and more restless everyday, waiting for something to happen, but you don’t even know what that something is. And as days go by, you become more and more disillusioned and lost and you don’t even know what you’re doing anymore or why you’re doing anything at all. And all this just makes you so exhausted that you wonder what even is the point of anything and you just have energy left to go on."
59,depression,I'm giving up. last therapy appointment today,"Its 330 am. Its been 2 years of ""therapy"". 3 years of not working. I do nothing. I am nothing. But a burden. Its not a idea. Its a fact.

61,depression,Exhaustion,"I’ve never been happy my entire life. I had a horrible childhood with abusive parents to the point that I can’t function. I hear a loud noise and I lock up for a bit because I’m afraid it’s my dad ready to hit me again, I wasn’t allowed to leave my house and socialize so I have no social skills to go out and make friends. My only relationship after 21 years of living turned out horrible and scarred me multiple ways

I finally found someone who I truly cared for, loved deeply beyond belief and would do anything for, literally everything I’ve ever wanted out of someone in a relationship, but of course they are on the other side of the world. Like how cruel is that. It’s like I finally get handed a bone in life, but it’s got all of these different catches for me to actually earn that bone (even though my entire life up to this point might as well have been the catches to earn the bone). Then when I finally decide to make the most of the situation and rise to the challenge, that bone is taken away.

I just don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t find enjoyment in anything anymore, I have no drive to do anything better with myself, I just don’t know what to do. I did everything I could to make her as happy as I could and it wasn’t enough. I just never feel I’m enough and life keeps proving that feeling correct

I don’t even have the energy to finish this post. I just want to be ignored by everyone, I want to rot away and do nothing with my life. 

I don’t even know what I want from making this post. Maybe I just want someone to hear my problems and pretend they care, maybe I just want to vent my problems to the wind and then forget about them like I’ve always done, maybe I want someone to reach out. I don’t even know. I guess maybe some guidance on what to do with myself would be nice"
62,depression,I CARE!,"I will read your post and try my best to respond because I care about you, anyone who’s dealing with sadness, anxiousness, loneliness, depression, etc. I care!! You don’t have to go through it alone! If I could/can help and and save someone, I freaking will!"
63,depression,I think I might explode.,"Hey. I have controlling parents, I cut off a really close toxic friend a month ago (he has depression, anxiety and ADHD) and this is the longest I have spent not talking to him, my boyfriend doesn't have time for me, I lost my position in my college society because I failed to come to the interview, my friends are in different states, I have harm OCD and basically I feel lonely. I am not lonely mind it...but I feel lonely.

Sometimes I think....if I off myself...that'd be the most peaceful I'd feel in a long time...I cannot believe I am saying this; I swear if you saw me at my prime I was so happy, joyous, laughing girl. I made everyone's day. People called me because they knew talking to me would make them happy. I have some really genuine friends....and my boyfriend loves me. My parents do too...but I just wanna rest man. I felt so happy looking through some tombstones epitaphs. Somehow.

I feel drained now. I don't really have much expectations from anyone. I have been let down too much. Fuck I have let myself down too. 

I talk politely. I have never raised my voice on anyone. I dont have angry outbursts. I dont even remember the last time I felt angry. I find no will. I am surrounded by people who love me. They really do. And would be broken if I leave. But....

I think I have lit the match. I will soon burn the bridge. Not anytime soon but I know I would go down with it.

Things will get better tomorrow, I will laugh and go on a double date with my boyfriend, meet my friends, go to college, study literature...do the things I love but now it has become lifeless. I don't...feel it.

Sorry if this seems like a damsel in distress lmao. Just letting out stuff buried in me."

66,depression,Wondering if I’m getting depression?,"I’m 21F in college. Found out I was pregnant and got left by him after. I loved him too.

 I’m trying to be logical about everything: that we wouldn’t have ever worked, that it was a matter of time, that I really wouldn’t want to be with a person that abandoned me, that I dodged a bullet. 

Now I’m done with dating until I can figure out how to be happy by myself. But that’s turning out to be more difficult than I thought. I’ve lost interest in everything. I don’t feel happy or even feel like myself when hanging out with my friends (I was an extrovert). I don’t crave anything (food/cooking used to be my hobby). Getting out of bed is hard bc I think about how he wronged me the second I wake up. My mind just feels lost. 

I’ve been through breakups before. I worked out, cooked, wrote, joined a sorority, went out, made great girl friends, had a blast with them. This time feels so different. Therapy is good in general, but I don’t have the finances to comfortably support it. Any advice? Should I just really turn for medical help?"

I look in the mirror and don't even fucking recognize myself, and the loneliness is so fucking bad, so so bad and I can't fucking take it, I haven't genuinely talked to someone in 2 fucking years and I'm fucking losing it, I don't go to school and I don't work so I can't meet anyone and I think I'm just fucking ready to end it"
70,depression,Help for an empathetic psychopath?,"I'm gonna make this short and simple. Due to childhood and family trauma, I have different personalities where I organize different feelings. My main me is an anxious and depressed empath who wants harmony and peace in society. My doppelganger is psychopathic serial abuser, drugger, manipulator, prospective killer, and suicidal maniac. He has more than a dozen sexual harassment and assault victims. I have been firmly in control for the past couple years, and he's done some regrettable things but nothing prison worthy in that time. I've only recently become aware of his existence and most of his memories I had no recollection of. Every day I remember more and become more and more terrified of the monster inside of me. He can do anything and has no limits. He has every psychopathic tendency at once. 

I know I need help. A lot of help. The only therapists I've ever been to were religious gay conversion therapists that my parents sent me to as a kid, so I don't have the best reaction to therapy, but I need to push through it. I'm completely broke rn and going through a lot so I can't afford therapy if I wanted to. I can't ask my family for help because they'd inevitably send me to a religious counselor and I'd just gaslight my way out of it as usual. I can't ask my gf's family to pay for it because that's not fair and they have their own struggles to worry about. 

I really need help and I don't know where to look so here I am."
71,depression,Having a day scheduled to die,"Thoughts of having a day scheduled to die maybe in 5-10 years and during that time you would do your best with whatever *you're* interested, *you're* enjoying even if they're not considered as things worth doing or important by *experts* in the society.

I have finally caught a break from school now, and at first I knew I was being lazy but now I feel this heavy exhaustion and anger. I have done nothing for 4 days, and I have pending deadlines that NEED to be met. I don’t feel the numb depressed feeling, I just feel angry and lazy. I have managed to make myself shower and still eat and function but I have things I want to get done but can’t perform properly.

73,depression,Sometimes I Look Back and Hate Myself For What I've Done,"A few years ago my mother (who emotionally abuses me) took me out for a night on the town. We grabbed drinks and then she took me to see a concert.

I was so ungrateful that I had a shitty attitude all night long. I remember when the band was playing a song (I can't quite remember the name, but it was light and uplifting) I had a massive frown on my face the entire time.

Maybe this was her way of apologizing? Was she trying to make things right?

I'll never forgive myself for being so negative and sour. She wanted to do something fun with me, her only son, and I let my bad attitude spoil it.

77,depression,I booked a flight (other side of the world),More than 10y of depression and I STILL dont know how to manage it. I'm on my dark period right now I stopped working for months and on the paper I'm studying from home (UNI) but I didn't open a single pdf since the start of the year. I took my saving Less than 3k and booked a flight with the hope of feeling a bit better i'm leaving soon for a country that I like but i'm not that excited I used to travel a lot but this time i'm feeling NOTHING i'll just get on the plane and i'll see. I'll took my computer to see of i'll want to start studying(It will be a miracle). My mental health is a complete mess yesterday I took a shower cause the smell was just too much after 1month. I'LL come back with nothing but I HOPE to regain a bit of energy to take care of myself. I'm a female (29) a complete failure I didn't graduate from my studies yet cause I was never able to EITHER finish the year or start one. Worked part job never full time cause i just can't follow the rythm. SO that's it I just wanted to vant. Thanks
78,depression,I am sad. PLEASE help me.,"I'm sad. Please help me.

Backstory: my mom had me as a teenager. My biological dad and his parents all died (not sure whether this was before I was born or not). Mom married another dude and this man hates me.hes always hated me.i know it. My mom's whole family knows. Nothing could ever be done cos people had to protect my mother marriage.

Moved out at 23. We live on diff continents now. Still no relationship but they reached out to reconnect and hopefully help since I live in a country alone w no support system. Their families are in my city but they hate me for not getting pregnant young cos that's all they know and who do I think I am to escape that. So no relationship w them.

Turns out my mom didn't send her husband to reach out cos they wanted to help. They wanted to keep tabs on me to see how much I was failing since the pandemic has destroyed the 2 industries where I make a living. They wanted to gloat at how much I am a failure because I should've listened to them and rejected my dreams and opted to do life their way. Be in corporate and get a husband. Turns out my getting a husband was their only future plan for me.

Anyways: while working to make ends meet, my landlord had an affair and was kicked out of his house and I was evicted cos he needed to stay in my apartment. I packed my belongings into storage cos I've had a really tough year. I've had accident after another w broken bones, nursing myself back to health so I haven't worked this year as I was bed ridden. When I healed, I had to move. Flew across the world to visit my parents as my baby bro invited me for his graduation. I knew this was a bad idea but I'll do anything for my bro. The idea got worse cos now I'm no longer just a kid my mom's husband can abuse, now I can stand up for myself. My mom can't ever defend me, she has nothing. Standing up for me will leave her homeless cos she gave up her career to build his and today she's just broke w nothing to show for it. 

I have had the greatest career in the past decade. I kick ass. I am amazing. And talented w awards to boot for all my incredible work. I worked hard to build myself a home. Security. Something my mother failed to give me all my life. A safe space. I have failed multiple times in my life but I have always gotten up to fight. But not this time. I don't know how to get back up. I'm broken. All I do is cry. I don't have any money. A friend put me up in their vacant apartment. I have lost my purpose. I feel like I've lost everything. I'm broken. I don't know how to get up. I can't look for work cos I can't sit up for 5min without tears. All I've done in the 5 weeks in this apartment is allowed myself to be sad, feel it and allow myself to work through it but I need money to feed myself. 

The positives: I've been absolutely stress free for the first time in my life. It's such a big deal all the inflammation in my body is gone. I no longer need nasal surgery, my endometriosis has subsided, no anxiety or panic attacks. 

I need to work but I'm not finding the reason to motivate myself. It's getting very dark and suicidal and I don't want it to get there. 

I feel like I gave my everything to build my life. Dropped the ball once by having an accident and now I've lost my home. If I can't build a home and give myself some security, what am I working for? What is the point.

Someone help me!"

89,depression,The apathy is terrifying,"I feel like a robot. Everything is falling apart but I can't care about it. It's as though depression is leaving no room for any emotion other than ""meh"". 

I've suffered depression since childhood but I have never before felt this level of apathy. What's different this time? What the hell is my brain gearing up for?"
90,depression,doubters,what do you tell people who say that depression isnt real?
91,depression,I finally accepted that I am completely alone,"I live alone, I work alone, I have no friends, but it never really clicked until last night that I really am alone. I'm introverted and I talk to myself and I spend a lot of time daydreaming so it's easy to ignore the loneliness for months at a time. I haven't even left my room in three days.

My family always wanted a normal son and never thought I could achieve anything in my life, but I am not normal and I will never live the life they want me to live and I refuse to give up on my dreams. So I moved as far away as possible as soon as possible and I only see them several times a year. I haven't achieved the life I want yet, but at least nobody's telling me what I can't do anymore.

There is nobody coming to help me, but there are plenty of people who will take advantage of me. I can't say how many times I've been screwed over in business and by friends. You can literally shake someone's hand and make a deal and the second they have to live up to their end, they betray you.

There will only ever be one person who will always be with me and that is myself so I may as well get used to my own company and try to help myself, because I can't be sure that anyone else will. There may be other people in my life, but I must always remember that I can't rely 100% on anyone. Friendships end, business people betray, lovers cheat.

It's a shame there isn't a way to know who you can trust, so I guess I just have to play the odds. I will always need people around me to work for, and eventually I will have to date and make friends in order to live the life I want. If I replace everyone I can't trust, eventually I'll have a network of people who are likely to be there for me, but I always need to remember that I'm the only one who will 100% be with me.

So I want to know how to be my own best friend first and do for myself what I would do for others. I can be a great friend to others, but I have difficulty helping myself because truthfully I don't like myself. Any advice is appreciated. Sorry for the rant."
92,depression,A nurse made me promise I wouldn’t kill myself today,"I recently went to the ER for self harm and had to call my primary doctor to set up an appointment for a medication change + talking about the whole ordeal at the hospital.

I contacted through a nurse first to explain what happened and see if I could get a earlier appointment than the one scheduled for two weeks from now. 

I have never met a nurse so personally worried for my well being. She talked to me on the phone and multiple times asked me not to kill or hurt myself before my appointment tomorrow morning. I kept reassuring her I wouldn’t.

I’m not uncomfortable with this at all, it was weirdly comforting. So, thank you to that nurse."

95,depression,Having a cold/flu and being depressed and anxious? Advice needed,"Hi all,

Recently I've been suffering with some mild COVID19 symptoms after testing positive last Thursday. I'm out of isolation tomorrow but over the last 3-4 days I would say that my mental health has taken a hit. I'm taking Escitalopram 10mg but was finding that was working well before my positive test for COVID. Over the last few days, I've been feeling down, anxious, restless, irritable, grumpy, you name it.  I also have little interest in doing things. It's almost like being ill has made my antidepressants stop working and I'm undergoing some kind of withdrawal. 

Does this feeling go away when I recover from this illness? I just feel so low at the moment, whereas I would say I felt pretty good before my test last Thursday."

She is showing signs of early onset Alzheimer’s and I’m feeling extremely alone. Any advice for me?

im not really sure if I feel love. I feel it in like a transactional way. Like if someone can do shit for me and other super selfish shit. I don’t really understand loving someone or something without intrinsic value. is there a disorder or something associated with this? I have autism, sensory integration disorder, a mood disorder NOS(not otherwise specified), and “major” depression if that helps. Is this maybe BPD? I have looked into BPD a lot and it seems to fit with other stuff I’m going through. If it is BPD, that would help narrow down the mood disorder. Please help, I really don’t know and no one will listen to me about this. Thanks"

I really don't have any options, I don't trust therapists, I don't want to take antidepressants, and I don't have anyone I can talk to besides my mom who isn't helping. It feels like I'm trying to do 1000 things at once, i have to go to school for 7 hours a day and help my little brother with his work even though he is perfectly capable of doing it himself and just plays video games all day, deal with my 27 year old brother throwing temper tantrums about the smallest things and screaming at my mom all while pretending I'm ok because if I so much as sigh my big brother will say some dumb shit like ""at least you didn't spend 40 dollars on some Yu-Gi-Oh cards and didn't get the one you wanted like I did "" When someone goes up to me and starts talking to me about how much worse their life is it makes me feel way worse, I WISH I had 40 bucks to spend on cool shit I wanted. like earlier today he told me to my face  (your anxiety isn't anywhere near as bad as mine) if anyone would've asked me if I could kill myself like last year I would have said no, but now If I had a gun I probably would.

114,depression,I think I made a mistake getting out of the house,"I've been going through this episode of crippling depression since Thursday-ish, and today I decided to accept an invitation from my group of friends to go out. I was not sure at first since the idea was to go grab something to eat and I've haven't been eating really. My boyfriend said he wanted to go so I said ""hey, maybe could be good for me to get out"", we ate, all good. Then we decided to go for some beers, but now I starting to feel really anxious (I think it is anxiety, but not completely sure, haven't really confirmed it with any professional), pressure on the chest, can't stop moving, I'm always moving my leg, scratching my arm, and all that I can think of is that I really would like to literally run away from here. I'd really like to run all the way home, get I'm bed and just watch something with my cat. I feel like I should not have gotten out of the house...
One of my friends is really annoyed by me because I've not been much in touch with any of them. I didn't want to let down any of them too... I'm afraid to lose everyone 

And this crippling depression is really bad dude. Haven't been able to get myself to eat anything more than crackers and milk at nights. Same dishes in the sink since Thursday...
I've been even breaking one of my most precious rules: ""everything might feel likes it's falling apart, but my apartment is not going to be one of them""
I feel so done with everything. Not so nice thoughts constantly..."
115,depression,I've had enough. I'm tired.,"Everything hurts. Sometimes I just wish for everything to end. But both life and death scares the shit out of me. I'm tired of life, but I'm too scared to die now. I don't have the courage to continue living my life but also to confront death at this moment. I'm lost and I'm stuck.

I find myself wondering how nice it would be to just end it all. Like, when I'm driving, I sometimes wonder what would happen if I just turn the steering wheel and hit the gas pedal all the way down. I know that drowning hurts so much but it's not uncommon that I find myself wishing that I'm floating in the middle of the ocean, moving with the waves, engulfed by the darkness underwater, and just be. 

I find it quite ironic that when I lay down to sleep, I always thought how nice would it be if I don't wake up at all, but I always pray so God would wake me up with a new good day before I go to sleep.

Everything and everyone, including me, sucks."
116,depression,Gluten Intolerance was causing a lot of my chronic depressive symptoms,"I’ve changed my diet and am feeling a lot better every day.

118,depression,Depression management from lifestyle changes alone?,"I've been trying various medications (Various SSRIs, SNRI, and Wellbutrin) over the years now and it seems like
there's either no benefit to taking these medications or the side effects are even worse than the symptoms associated with my Depression and Anxiety. Did anyone get out of a depression rut through lifestyle changes (exercise, diet, etc.) without the use of medications? I'm really struggling with fatigue and
hypersomnia and there doesn't seem to be issues with my blood work."
119,depression,&lt;3 A lonely rant about 'loneliness' &lt;3,"Sometimes I wonder if I have anyone.

I know I do but maybe it doesn't always feel like it idk.

I guess I just wish I knew what it was like to have someone that's always there for you. Someone to encourage you and to rely on. Someone who will sit there, listen to you cry, tell you that you're gonna be okay, and to remember that the pain is only temporary.

I wonder what it's like to have someone wipe your tears away when you can't stop crying or to hug you so tight you're forced to take a breath, sit with you just because you need the company.

Sometimes I feel like being lonely is a sickness, Something that cripples my body, continuously aches inside me. I know it's there but no matter how hard I try nobody has answers and I am never any closer to finding out a cure. The worse it gets, the more desperate I become, giving into half assed back alley work which only ever seems to make it worse. 

The realization that nothing is working and that no matter what you do, it's not gonna go away.

Staring out at everyone else just existing, that one person with friends they've known since they were 6 yrs old, turned into now highschool sweethearts that feel like a cheesy movie no one would ever believe could actually come true.

Watching two people hold hands and skip through the store like idiots just because...

Or a group friends in the car all singing backstreet boys as loud as they can because it's cringe and abnoxious but life is too short so who tf cares. 

Sitting around and talking about serious shit most of you know nothing about but you all think you're somehow the only people on planet earth who are smarter than the rest of the world.

Inside joke after inside joke without any hesitation.

Trying to rap to random beats that just end in you all laughing until you cry because the raps are so shit.

Literally just chilling by a fire and eating s'mores with the stars in the sky, crickets the fill the silence and the cozy flame that makes you feel right at home in that shitty lawn chair you keep in the trunk just in case.

Sometimes I believe I'll find this one day... And then sometimes I don't, idk. 

I'm just tired of waking up everyday, knowing the day has so much potential only to be disappointed by how hard I try to make it different but it ends up feeling exactly the same.

I don't want to deal with the trauma, the triggers, the panic attacks, the emptiness I feel when I'm struggling and no one is ever around, wishing I had someone to call who would just listen and talk to me. Someone I could trust and know that they care and aren't just manipulating me for their own personal gain. Someone I know who wants me around regardless of the constant struggle, the tears, the pain, the paranoia, and impulsiveness or weird/odd things about me like wanting to build shit with Legos, playdough, K'nex, popsicle sticks... Spontaneously wanting to go to the trampoline park and then realizing I'm too scared to attempt any tricks. Or maybe just sitting out on the balcony wearing a fluffy sweater in the cold autumn weather because it makes me feel all cozy inside.


I hope everyday that it's not true... but maybe I really am the only one.. because if I wasn't, then why am I still alone."

122,depression,Lost fear of death,"2 nights ago I overdosed and essentially died. I hadn't touched opiates in over a decade but feeling depressed I took some when it was offered. I don't remember much, seems like it was very easy to just... slip away. Suddenly I was awake and in pain and vomiting as paramedics revived me. My friend had given me several shots of narcan and I didn't respond so he called 911.

Ever since I've been pretty messed up in the head, both thinking about how easy and calm it was, and wishing I hadn't been revived. It's shown me that the part of this I've feared most can actually be peaceful. While I am not planning suicide, I've always felt it's how I would go, and now I'm a little more sure of it. I don't know when it will happen, but it's getting close."

I’ve gone to a therapist which proved to be of no help. And I’m at a loss. 

I don’t find joy in anything, I recently started a job that’s causing more depression for me (but I can’t quit it since I have bills to pay, and I’m actively looking for another job, nothings worked out yet), I spend most days in my room doing nothing because I have no motivation/energy anymore (even though I use to be a very active person) up until I have to work (3rd shift), I’m more tired when I wake up than when I go to sleep, and every single day I think of new ways I can “off myself” quietly and quickly so I don’t bother my family and so I don’t suffer any more than I already have. 

Before all this I had started to get clean off of nicotine and alcohol, but that quickly came back. r/

Since whenever I'm in school I'm distracted by classmates and studies. But whenever I'm home, i have nothing else to do which makes me overthink my life.

I (24) suffer from diagnosed treatment resistant depression, cptsd, and gad. I got away from my abusers when I just turned 21, unfortunately I fell right into a different kind of abuser, and then I was in a youth homeless shelter for 2 months, and then I had like an assisted living youth apartment thing for about 6 months until I lost the fifth job due to my crippling mental illness, and I went and lived with another abusive person for about a year and I got my 6th 7th and 8th job while I was living there all of them I ended up getting fired for basically being unable to work because if I actually tried to work I would break down and literally cry and like have an anxiety attack. my seventh job actually paid somewhat decently and I ended up getting kicked out of this person's home just as I got it I had support from my SMI clinic to help me get like a normal apartment and help me pay rent for the first couple of months I lived there for about 6 months before I was hospitalized for 12 days after trying to kill myself, I came home I worked that next week and then I simply could not work anymore the thought doing pretty much anything was so dreadful that I couldn't get out of bed most days much less work I simply laid in bed and distracted myself with like YouTube or sleep and that's pretty much all I did until I was officially fired on December 10th after that job refused to work with me and my issues at that time I had also run out of the savings I had made and despite my best efforts I wasn't able to come up with rent I got an eviction notice and on the final day before I would be evicted I was intending on becoming a statistic, but for some reason I contacted crisis and ended up back in the hospital for 22 days and after that I've been living in like a housing program kind of thing obviously now we're at like the end of September I have tried several times to get a job or really do anything but have been just unable, but my housing program love to ask me about what my plans are in getting a job and moving out and stuff as though they had done literally anything to help me over the last many months I tried to get my clinic to help me apply for disability but they basically refused to help me apply because I had had jobs before even though I have literally not worked in over a year at this point and very seriously doubt being able to do so anytime soon.

I just I wish my issues were physical I wish people could see them nobody I interact with on a daily basis understands what it's like to just constantly be in physical emotional and mental pain I slept like 20 hours a day every single day in August due to summertime SAD, luckily that is slightly going away now I'm almost at my baseline of everything I just don't know what to do. none of the professionals that I deal with really seem to understand none of them could do anything either way I try to make friends talking in like local internet groups but I can't explain to them in a way that they understand that I can't go anywhere I have absolutely no money nobody can come over to where I live cuz I live in a housing program I just feel so isolated and like nobody actually cares I just don't know what to do anymore. I think the worst part is that I feel like I could do some sort of job of some kind I could be quote unquote productive but I would lose my Medicare and I would have to pay rent and utilities and this that and the other with basically minimum wage at super low hours in a job that just abuses me which is just literally not something that I can do if I actually got a job, assuming they could look past the fact that I tell them up front that I have crippling fucking mental illnesses I wouldn't be able to do it. I feel like if I didn't have to worry about all of the just everything collapsing around me as soon as I try to get a job that I could like volunteer or something but I don't have any options for that I don't have any way to go anywhere I have hours of obligation to redundant mental health lecture bullshit things every single day everyone just wants to waste my time and suck as much money out of ""treating me"" as possible I don't know I feel like I've rambled enough yeah that's it I guess"

I get why they think it cowardly, but all I ever hear from people is how they always choose the easy path through life. 

People only pick the hard option when they have no option to choose from. It's hypocritical, even though I know they don't mean it that way.

Doing small things is hard, but I get zero satisfaction from getting out of bed or taking a shower. I'm not convinced going to work or finding a partner will be satisfying either.

Nothing less than a huge upheaval in my life will work and I'm not even convinced of that. I only believe that because it's wild to think a massive change of every part of my life wouldn't help me feel better. 

Suicide is sooooo much easier. It's guaranteed to satisfy."

I now realize that those weren’t scratches, they were cuts. Perfectly parallel, 4-6 inch cuts on her upper arm (on the inside of her arm around her bicep). I’m pretty sure I saw cuts on the stomach that almost went from hip to hip. 

It’s so heartbreaking to think that my beautiful, smart little sister could be hurting this much inside that she feels the need to harm herself. I have no idea what to do, I’ve dealt with depression for 8 years but I’ve never personally SH."

It took me 5.5 agonizing years but I finally graduated, but no satisfaction followed that, it felt stolen from me. I closed my laptop on the last day, and walked 2 feet to my bed, and that was it. No ceremony, no anything.

What really stung was how most people I was constantly there for and was close with in college all but completely abandoned me. One particular friend turned hostile towards me before they moved away. 

On top of all that, on and off for a few years throughout all this I was seeing a girl that treated me like shit. I had to break us up on her behalf when I finally got her to admit she just didn't like me that much.

I guess to wrap this all up, I feel like I get used and thrown out, over and over again, regularly throughout my life. I wish I could vent my frustration to these peoples faces about how they treated me, but thats not really who I am. I'm a pushover, and I have no self esteem. I blame myself and my mental health for why people don't like me. Of course they're all successful doing their own things now, and I feel stuck in a rut without  current employment and tons of anxieties holding me back. It all feels unfair and I'm just bitter about it, I wish I could just move on, but the anger and depression stays. If you made it to the end thanks for listening, hopefully some of you guys can connect with this."
143,depression,College isn't for everyone,"I'm currently in my senior year of college and it is safe to say that I have not enjoyed a single aspect of it. I have relatively no friends and the one that I had moved away and left me alone to live with three strangers in an apartment. There are times where I will wait hours in my room before coming out to be sure I won't have to bump into anybody in the common room/kitchen. I am a dual major with a minor, yet after many recent health issues including fainting from academic stress, I'm not even sure I can go through with the job I have been aiming for years to get. I feel very lost right now and spend almost every weekend at home even though it's a 3-hour drive from school. I just feel like all of my plans for the future are falling through and I can't even talk to friends for advice because I don't really have any. I cannot think of things getting better for a while and I'm just exhausted."

146,depression,weird med affects on dreams,"My whole life, I've never had dreams (at least not ones I can recall). The only times in my life I do get dreams is when I have a fever of above 101 and they are fucking terrifying (theyre these weird conceptual geometric things where the world shrinks/grows around you, time keeps marching on, and youre just stuck) (it doesnt sound scary but I've literally woke up screaming from them).

Anyways, since I was put on prozac, about three months ago, I have had dreams every fucking night. I literally do not understand how people live like this, having dreams and shit.
It's absolutely awful and I don't know what tp do about it. I know I dont like the dreams, and sometimes I'll wake up crying, but I can't even tell if they would be classified as nightmares, because they're nothing like the nightmares I tend to get. (for example, the past few have been my mother was a murderous excorcist, my house was invaded by squirrells, my grandma showed up and I was bit by a turtle, an entire history of mass genocide in a nonexistent country) I genuinely cant tell if they are nightmares and I have an actual issue to work through here, or if they are normal dreams and I'm just not acclimated
Every morning, I wake up utterly exhausyed from having had a dream, and I can rarely even fall asleep anymire wothout passing put from exhaustion.
Any advice for what I should do?
Or maybe any tips that could reduce dreams, help sleep, that sort of thing
any help is appreciated &lt;3"

I'm incredibly lonely, I was rejected recently by someone who I thought was into me as I was them, but it wasn't to be. My confidence is at an all time low. I have 2 weeks off sick from work but my boss keeps hounding me about when I'll be back. I can physically feel my anxiety in my head - not a headache as such, but just pressure in the front of my skull. I hate this. All I want to do is sleep but I have a pet that's dependent on me. It's so rough. Why was I not good enough for this person? Why can't I be better looking.

And tbh i feel like my life is already shit and i dont see my self dying by natural causes and im very confident that if i dont change something with my life i will end up killing myself in the future.

I just want to be happy again the main reason why im sad and depressed is bc how lonely i am. I have like 2 friends that im not even that close to. I just want someone i can go to after a rough day and pat me on the back and tell me everything will be ok. But no my social skills fucking suck and idk how to fix it.
And my antidepressants stopped working. I went to a hospital for 6 hours over that shit i had to piss in a cup and get my blood drawn just for them to say no we cant prescribe medicine. Idk"

153,depression,Depression room help!,"First post on here
So today I decided to get up and clean my depression room. With a positive mindset I started cleaning, took a break, then went back. Long story short I came back and starting removing some old food and saw some maggots. Wasn’t like hundreds of them, maybe like 30. That was the first time I had ever seen something like this in my room so I disposed of them ( searched on Google how) and cleaned up after. 
 Even though my room is clean, my closet is a whole nother story. I know I have some old food in there along with ( not proud ) very very dirty pieces of clothes. It’s a horror in there and I don’t even want to check if there’s maggots.

I was wondering if there’s some sort of cleaning service I can get to clean my closet out ( people similar to the hoarder shows cleaners ). Because I feel deeply ashamed of this and really don’t want to ask for help from my mother. Not that she would even help if I asked her."
154,depression,I want to die without my body destroyed,"You know, pills or something like that. It would be horrible thing for my parents to see me hanged or splashed in the pavement. It's the only reason. But drugs like sleeping pills are not easy to get so I don't know what to do."
155,depression,TW : Self harm - attention or something more,"Do you keep it a secret? Or do you make it obvious and use it as a way to communicate that you’re struggling to your loved ones? 


Long story short : I have dabbled in self harm over the years usually burning because I am very conscious of not wanting it to be obvious and I find burns are the easiest to give excuses for. 

When I reflect on the times I have burnt myself I wonder at the reasons I did. I tend to think SH as a release - the pain distracts and cuts through the heightened emotions I am usually feeling at the time and gives me clarity and calm. Kind of like the shock of cold water to wake you up when drowsy, the shock of pain and associated adrenaline seems to “burn” out everything else. 

I know some people do it for punishment or because they feel they deserve it or for many other reasons but usually I do it for the sensation and the accompanied calm. 

I have recently started taking some pills - not in a “self harm” way (although I acknowledge it probably still counts) but I do it for the same purpose of overpowering the other feelings I am experiencing. 

Both the physical SH and the pills is something that I hide because I fear the judgement and misunderstanding that will come with telling anyone. I am not doing it for their attention or acknowledgement but rather to get some relief from “noise” in my brain (aka emotions and thoughts) 

Does this make it worse/more dangerous?"
156,depression,"I used to post here a lot, then everything improved, and 5 year later I'm back.","I was extremely depressed. I would spend my time alone writing in my journal, filling many pages a night expressing my feelings. I'd fill up entire books and then light them on fire, tear them apart, or drown them for a cathartic release.

I would make posts on here explaining how I felt, and how lost I was.

Then I met someone who changed my life. A mother of 2 who I immediately felt comfortable with. Things progressed and eventually she moved in with me. Her oldest was 6 and the youngest just 1 yr old.

I was scared. I wasn't sure if I could handle it. I didn't have any kids of my own, I never had even held a child. But their mother made me so happy, and immediately took my depression away. It's like when we met, my lows elevated to just normal 'bad days'. It was like magic. I loved her immediately for that.

I have my own problems from past traumas, and I'm not a perfect partner by any means. But I decided I was going to go all in on being the best partner and co-parent I could. For 3 years, every decision I made and nearly every thought I would have was based around the question ""Is this good for my partner or is it good for the children long term?""

I devoted my life to them. I potty trained the youngest. I taught the oldest how to read, study, and do math.

I have a loving family, but until this point I had never come close to feeling the kind of love I felt for these children.

The youngest gave me a little pink bracelet of stars when she was around 4 yrs old. I've worn it every moment of every day since, as a reminder of what I'm working hard for.

This was my primary focus for 5 years. 

About a month ago, I found out that my partner was cheating on me. I confronted her about it and her response was to tell me how she was unhappy with me and then she took her kids and left. I haven't seen them since.

One morning I'm waking up playing with kids, goofing around and having fun with them, and the next night I'm sitting in my home alone and knowing that I'm never going to see them ever again. 

5 years or finally being happy. I would wake up every day feeling so grateful that the deep emptiness I once felt was gone. So glad to finally feel like I had a purpose and to finally feel pure happiness.

For nearly 10 years prior to meeting my ex, I spent almost every night writing about how unhappy I was. Almost every night going over the pros and cons of just ending my life.


And I've forgotten all of those feelings. And it's all come rushing back to me, and ontop of it all, I've lost the people that I have loved the most in my entire life.

I will never see 'my daughters' next birthday, let alone the day she graduates. I will never get to see 'my sons' first sports game or help him build his first computer.

This life is so unbearably cruel.

I am so scared of the future. Everything was so much harder before. And now I'm back to square one but with the additional weight of having lost everything I had devoted my life to.

Every night I'm alone and no matter how bad I feel, there is no one to comfort me. I'm in so much pain."

158,depression,I am afraid my mindset is keeping me from making progress. Do I get depression wrong?,"Hello guys
It would mean the world if you could offer me some advice regarding my mindset or sharing some personal experience.

I (F28) am diagnosed with depression for ten years and with BPD for seven years.
The BPD is pretty much under control by now (thank god!!) but the depression isn’t.
I am not sure it was like this over those ten years that I’ve battling with depression, but for at least half, I feel insanely tired.

This is important, I promise.

Over the last years, I probably didn’t have one month, adding up, that I felt energized, enthusiastic about anything for more than five minutes or just plain normal.

It’s hard to shower, to brush my teeth, to get out of bed, to go outside, to talk to people. It’s hard to do everything, even things I like.

I am taking my meds and seeing my psychiatrist regularly. I also do therapy.

My doctor is super nice and I don’t plan to switch, it took me forever to find a good match. But once in a while, she says things that make me question everything.

I will give some examples:
She says I need routine to get better. But this makes me wanna cry in frustration, because I can’t do it. The way I see it, it’s the other way around. As soon as I feel better, routine will come back naturally. This is how it worked when I had ups over the last years.

She also says that if I don’t do something, it means I am boycotting myself.
Ok, sometimes. But always?
Is it so hard to believe I can’t do things ?

I don’t know. I am confused. I wanna cry.
Am I being lazy or am I really impaired? I feel so tired. I just wanna rest.

What if I am not doing enough to get better?
Is it my fault I am wasting my life? It breaks my heart. I loved so many things. I wanted to do so much."
159,depression,"Bruh, I just can’t","Just why? Why does it always come down to this? I take my meds, I socialize, I call my siblings, I hand out in person, I play games with friends. And yet, it always ends with me feeling alone, suicidal, isolated, not needed, not wanted, out of energy, and ready to see what’s next. I just don’t know what to do anyMore.

I try really hard to keep everything a joke, keep it in perspective, focus on the good. Yet even when it feels good I’m just waiting for it to get bad again. Strangely when it gets bad is the only time I feel at ease, cause at least it won’t get worse.

I go to therapy, I manage meds with a shrink, and yet I always end up here. How many more times do I have to do this before I can finally call it quits and say I have it my best try?"
160,depression,"I was playing a game and pulled off a nice play, said 'sheeesh' died a few seconds later and asked ""Why am I so bad?""","Less serious but I thought the contrast was pretty funny

165,depression,I'm no longer entertained,"I've probably posted the same sorta thing before lol but I don't really care. 

I can't find a single thing to entertain me anymore, and I've tried a lot of shit. Games are all the same and are no fun. I can still play them for hours but it almost feels like I'm on auto pilot and just passing time. 
All my hobbies are just dull at this point. I got into playing cards recently but that got old quickly because I have no one to play with. I'm tired of scrolling through the internet and only talking to people over the internet. The only hobby of mine that I actually stick with is working out, because I have a decent physique and I'd like to at least keep it like that or improve it a bit. 
I dunno, literally the only thing that entertains me is being with friends but outside of my friend group I feel so goddamn alone. I do not live close to any friends and it's rare that I get a chance to hang out, outside of school. 

I'm sure nobody read this lol. Either way I just needed to rant to something, and I didn't wanna burden my friends with my bs. Yeah ima go back to dying inside lol"

167,depression,Who can I trust?,"I learned I can’t even trust my wife. I have nobody to talk to or vent to anymore. I’ve been really struggling and having some bad thoughts lately.

I thought I could open up to my wife and tell her some of the dark thoughts I’ve had lately in terms of hurting myself and my father in law asked me if I was okay then felt the need to check up on me a couple days later, she claims she didn’t mention anything to him.

A couple of my family members felt the need to call me and ask if I was doing okay less than a week later, again she claims she didn’t say anything to them.

Her coworker even “wanted to talk to me” but she claims she didn’t say anything to her outside of saying “he’s stressed out”

I know it’s all bullshit

I know she’s been talking about the issues i have asked her to keep private. She knows I’m looking for help, I’ve asked her to keep my issues between us and to just let me find outside help on my own, I’ve asked her to not mention anything I say to anybody we know.

I’ve had to lie to family more in the past 2 weeks than I have in the past 30 years.

I’m tired of saying “no I’m fine just a little overwhelmed” or “yeah no I’m just a little stressed out with shit”

I can’t trust anybody anymore, I have nobody to talk to anymore. I can’t trust her anymore.

I feel so dead inside, I feel emotionless, I can’t even sleep.

I can’t even confide in my wife about shit I’m going through without everybody in our family knowing about it!

All it did is make things worse.

I was clinically diagnosed with PTSD and I don’t want to discuss it with everybody, I really don’t even want to talk about it but I trusted her. I can’t even do that now…

I don't enjoy none of my hobbies. The only good thing i have left are my friends. They are the only thing stopping me from ending it all, they are the only thin that genuinelymakes me laugh but only for a few hours, once they aren't there Im back to being tired. It feels like the end for me, can't see myself in the future being happy or even alive. School started again and I’ve been stressing out what I’m going to do with my fucking life. I dont know if i can keep up with my grades and I don't know if I can do this for another year or two. I just want this shit to end, I want to be happy, I want to rest. I hate this shit."

172,depression,My gf flirts with other people while being apathetic towards me. All while saying she's not good enough for me. Yet I still can't leave her.,"There are definitely reasons I am with her still. The times she's not apathetic she's outstandingly loving and makes me feel better than ever before.

But, the majority of the reason is that I don't think I'm good enough for anyone. So, the fact that I'm good enough for anyone, let alone someone as amazing as her makes me feel like I got unbelievably lucky and like I'll never get this luck again.

So, I continue with her. She ""unintentionally"" flirts with other guys even after I've mentioned it makes me feel shitty and I only express displeasure. She tells me she's unsure if she wants to commit any effort to the relationship and I ignore it. She says she's not sure if she has a desire to be with me and I ignore it still.

I've come to the conclusion that this is because I feel like I have no real attractive qualities and would end up with no one to embrace, left out in the cold, alone and sad if I left her."

Drugs, therapists, I just don’t really see a light anymore. I’m not depressed, just empty. I’m going to keep trying, but I feel like I’m just prolonging the inevitable."
174,depression,am I the problem?,"I'm currently overthinking about all the problems that's happened in my friend group, it's all coming down on me and I don't know what to do. I keep going back and replaying memories in my head, thinking about what I did wrong. The main reason a problem starts is because I don't know how to talk to others, I've never really been able to be straight forward with something. There are times that somethingnis going on and i dont know what to say and i just stay quiet, or i want to say something but nothjng comes out.I try and try but it never works, I continue to blame my disability (aspergers) but I don't even know if it's that anymore. I'm slowly loosing my friend group and I don't want that, I want to try and distance myself but I'll only feel lonely. I want to talk and be serious with them about why I've been acting this way but the truth is I don't know myself, when I don't say anything they get mad and I apologize. I'm currently laying in my bed replaying every problem that's happened in the friend group, I've come to the conclusion that they all connect back to me, every single one. I'm listening to the voice in my head berate me saying that I don't deserve friends and I deserve nothing, maybe he's right.
I want to cry but the tears won't come. I want a hug but I can never ask. I want help but I'll only feel bad asking for it. I want to vent but the words don't come out.  I'm scared I'm on the verve of losing everything that made me whole.
Another thing is I'm making my girlfriend miserable. We've been together 2 years now and I've noticed I do the same with her, I don't know what to do. I'm terrible at relationships,  especially since one girl I was dating killed herself, she's ended up in a coma and forgot everything for a while. We still talk which is good, but I can't help but blame myself for it all, being as it I wasn't able to help or stop her, was I the reason she did it? Was I putting on alot of pressure? I don't know about anything anymore. 
I need to know, is it all my fault?
Do I have that bad of luck or is it just my poor decision making?"
175,depression,I’ve had enough,I can’t do this anymore. I beat depression and life stressors then they return. I want love then find someone new then it doesn’t go well. I worked hard.

I guess I am in the middle. Kind of overdosed on some meds. But I knew I will wake up. I am trying to figure out what dosage will totally knock me out for ever.

First time I tried , I slept straight 15hrs.

Second time 24hrs.


Hmm ... I definitely don't want to build tolerance.


I have to figure a dose that will be the end of me and peaceful sleep.

Waking up after 24hrs , just felt so good. Like I finally rested for a bit.


I wish I never wake up.

I am planning to end it during the holidays, that way, my family has holiday vacation to get organized,  mourne me and return back to life again in 2023.


Let them have a fresh start for 2023.  I am no use to them  now days.  I have helped them as much as I can.


Now ,, I feel like a burden . I am ready , I am tired of the hope, and tired of trying different ways to get better ,


You know what for some ppl it just does not get better.


Imagine a person who lost his leg, no matter what he does, his leg won't grow back. Or a person who lost there ability to see .

No transplant will let him see again. Nothing will bring back the sight.

Just like that nothing will fix my depression , no matter how hard I try , i cannot get better.

Same with the person  who lost their legs they cannot grow another leg, but they have to accept they don't have legs and learn to adapt and live a life without leg.


I guess being depressed,  kind of the same , learn to live with depression and do everything u can to function with depression.

Now days, becoming just impossible to function. I got a taste of nothingness and I want to go back.

Whatever rest I got from the nothingness felt good.

I want to stay there and thats its. I don't wsnt to exist  , I just want to be unborn , whatever that state is, I want to have never existed ."

Then my husband and I had a minor disagreement this morning (really, we were mildly annoyed with each other for about two minutes), and now he's staying in bed. He's not coming with us. The kids will still have fun I'm sure, but I don't know how to cope with this anymore sometimes. It's hard to talk to him about it because it will reinforce his belief that we'd all be better off without him. It's also hard just to keep it in because I know it will happen again and it just makes me sad and angry.
Not sure what I'm looking for. Some empathy I guess, and advice."
183,depression,What can I do for my depressed partner?,"My boyfriend and I are going through a very rough patch. Not because there's a lack of love but he hasn't been the same since months. First he was complaining about feeling burned out and stressed but I didn't take it that seriously at this time (ca. 3 months ago). Little did I know it would get way worse after that and his burnout would eventually turn into a really bad depression. Everyone handles their depression individually, I know. Unfortunately he feels most comfortable whenever he's alone and needs a lot of distance from people. But because I'm also carrying very heavy weights on my shoulders (family issues and my own depressive + anxiety episodes) it's very hard for me to understand that he's not pushing me away because he doesn't want to be with me. He told me several times that he's not capable of doing anything at the moment and that he can't meet my needs right now because he can barely meet his own. I understand that but at the same time I feel unloved and anxious. I miss the person he used to be and it pains me a lot. I often mistake his egoistic behaviour for one of his personality traits and forget that it's not actually him but rather his mental illness speaking. I really don't know what to do or how to help him. Everything I tried didn't really work out and we ended up being more frustrated with each other than before. We even talked about a possible break up but then decided to keep trying because our love for each other is not dead at all. I truly care for him and he cares for me. There's just something in his head that keeps blocking everything. We compromised and agreed that I should learn how to be more patient without giving him any pressure and he should at least try to get out of his cacoon from time to time to kind of ""nourish"" the relationship more with love and kindness. I think it's also very important to mention that I suffer from an anxious attachment style which makes distance even harder for me. I hope I can learn some new things here to improve myself and the relationship I'm in. Thanks for reading and eventually commenting :)"

You failed a test, not a big deal,
You lost a loved one, a healthy grieve,

192,depression,“You can still leave”,"I was out with a depressed friend of mine and I made a joke about how she likes making fun of my dumbassery and she said “Well that’s something you have to tolerate if we’re friends. Better think twice about wether you want this. You can still leave.”

And I was a bit tipsy so my head was empty but I was still like wtf. I ended up laughing and saying “What? Where should I go?”

And she just said “You could leave and it’d be a sign that you don’t want to be friends anymore.”

I didn’t say anything to that and we just kept talking.
But now, the day after, I’m really bothered by this.

Is this how she always feels deep down? Is this something Depression makes you think? I really want to talk to her about it and assure her that I like having her in my life. Would it be okay to ask why tf she’d think I want to leave?

Edit: Later she said I had a good time and I said me too and she asked “was that sarcastic?”
Of course I said no, I like you and I had a good time but still. What is going on and how can I make it a little better, if at all?"

I find it so difficult to live my day to day life. I am medicated with 2 antidepressants and adderall for my adhd but I cant consistently take it (adderall) bc if i do, the withdrawals make me feel x10 worse and i know using it for extended periods of time will fuck up my brain. I am too scared to take it every day bc of how it will affect me in the long run. 

I wish i could just forget about all the trauma and pain and everything that makes me want to turn to substances but i cant. I feel like i was dealt such a shitty hand in life and when im drunk or high i dont have to think about that. i can just exist but at the same time i know how unhealthy it is. i am afraid that i will become the person that i hate and i would rather die than be that.

i know this is just rambling but i am drunk and so afraid that i will never get better. i wish i could just be normal. it is so hard."
195,depression,I don’t know who I am anymore,"Back in 2020 I (male) was living in a foreign country away from home (Australia) for about two years. When the pandemic hit we had to move back in a hurry. At that point I had just made real friends and people that I was growing really close to. I was in my first year of high school at that point. I moved back to Australia after not being able to go to school for a whole year and not having a real place to call home. Just moving between different houses until my family eventually found somewhere to settle down. Over the last two years I have been in several groups moved schools again and life could not have gone any worse for how I planned. Got into fights with others I had just met after a ton of racist hate in my first term of school. Kicked out and made fun of by my group. Eventually so bad I had to leave and go to a new school. 

I had what people call a glow up. I used to be on the bigger side and had terrible skin. I grew a ton and got my skin sorted out as well as worked out so I started to get a lot more attention. It started to get to my head the more fun I was having. However as I would get into a new group of mutual friends I had from my old school it became apparent to me that everyone had been friends for years and I just didn’t fit in at all. Subconsciously I started to change in my personality and the way I acted to be more liked, chasing friendship. This would result in my downfall because now I don’t know who I am. I’ve become a background character in everyone’s lives and don’t have any friends that would even consider me to be anywhere at 5th to 6th in their circle. The people I now value the most out of my friends just see me as another mate who’s just there. I don’t know who I’ve become now chasing other peoples approval and I hate the person I’ve become. 


How do I find my old self? 
tl:dr 
After moving countries chased friends and lost my own identity in the process."

198,depression,potential minor depression?,"hey peeps

&amp;#x200B;

recently ive been in and out of suicidal ideation cycles and i feel really depressed. not srue if i count for a diagnosis though because I don't have most of the symptoms, and its highlighted only when someone is mad at me or i think someone is mad at me.

&amp;#x200B;

i guess, for the most part, have a low self-esteem or feelings of inadequacy. deep sadness, lack of interests, conentration, and social withdrawal, which is kinda PDD. but i think it mostly  arises when i think someone is upset with me especially on social media, normally i feel happy and optimistic but lately i just want to avoid my problems. i also think minor depression may fit as well because i probably have less symptoms than i think i do. i suspect maybe situational depression may fit me a bit more but i have a feeling im developing depression symptoms in this realm and i just want to wallow in self pity for the most part

&amp;#x200B;

what should i do?"

201,depression,I’m thinking of going back to doing virtual school,"I’m in high school and this is my first year back from being a virtual student. (I’ve been virtual since the start of the lockdowns in 2020). I was so excited to be back from virtual schooling and be in the building with my “friends”. I hate it, it’s terrible. I don’t understand why I’ve been alone at this school for so long, I help people when they need it, I help people without being asked to and that’s what got me used. Literally no one talks to me unless it’s about something about class work but even that’s rare because the smart kids are usually put together or are in the same table group with their friends while I’m alone. At lunch I sit with other people who I thought were my friends but nobody talks to me. Nobody ever really fucked with me at this school, I was always just someone there to get homework answers from and that’s it.I never really fit in with anyone, I’m not apart of any cliques so I guess that’s one of the reasons why I was always alone at this school. I’m not really a introverted person but not a extrovert either, I can be very social if you get to know me and if I’m comfortable around you. I feel like it’s hard to be myself around these people because they’ll look at me weird for being me, I also feel like there’s some animosity towards me because a lot of the people that are in my classes and some that aren’t even in my grade or classes are rude towards me and I haven’t done anything to anyone. It’s my first year back from being virtual how does everyone hate me already?  I’m not popular or anyone of importance if I was I probably wouldn’t be making this post. It feels like whenever I do something funny nobody laughs everyone just looks at me weird and goes on with their day but if one of the popular kids did it everyone would die laughing. I’m not a goofy person or a class clown, I pay attention to the teacher, I don’t disrupt the class like many of the “popular kids” do and try really hard on my subjects especially math (math is my weakest subject) and I turn in assignments on time sometimes before they’re due. I’m not the smartest but I’m not the dumbest either. When my school went virtual during the 2020 lockdown everyone would be blowing up my phone asking for answers to the assignments or homework but I got the feeling I was being used so eventually I stopped giving out answers to see who my real friends were and to my surprise everyone stopped talking to me. Then when my school went back to doing physical school I really didn’t hear from anyone and I was hoping when I came back everything would be different. Now I’m thinking of going back to doing virtual school because I’m not happy doing physical school. If nobody wants to talk to me and I’m not enjoying my time in the building then what’s the point of being there? I’m tired of feeling and being an outsider by everyone. The benefit to me doing virtual school is I can get my hours back up at work since I’m only working Friday,Saturday and Sunday because I’m doing physical school. My teachers are probably going to be annoyed at me for wanting to go back to being virtual but this isn’t about them. I’m doing what I think is best for me."
202,depression,I’m so tired,"I think I pushed someone away that I shouldn’t have. It wasn’t so much a push as it was a shove. I didn’t try to work it out between us because I was hurting. And asking her if I could fix it isn’t fair because I told her I had to not talk with her anymore to help my mental health. I know now that wasn’t smart or right, and that I was a complete asshole. I only have two other people I feel like I can talk to about how I’m feeling and they are unavailable at best. At worst they leave me unread for days. I don’t know that therapy would even work because I figure out why I’m feeling a certain way on my own because I have all this time in my day alone, thinking. Wishing I could just stop. That I could disappear and be so much better for it. I can’t do this for much longer."
203,depression,I wanna fucking die,"My parents are forcing me to do labour work since I was 15 or 16 I dont know , I am their second born . I don't know why they hate me so much , their first born is a girl , I hate her so much , we are not that rich , my sister is very lucky since we didn't have that much money for her higher education my aunt is paying for her studies. Now I have graduated my high school I wanna learn more, here in my city no part time work is available for students. My parents always tells me that I am a burden for them I just wanna fucking die. they abuse me mentally and physically in front of all our relatives and neighbours
Even in front of my teacher. And I am a above average student I scored 91% in my exams . They tell me to do household chores and other work in our farms . I do it with all my power even If I do so much work they neglect it and tells every fucking one that I am useless , it makes me feel like I am fucking useless what is my purpose on the earth. Yesterday my father hit me in front of my cousin so much . Currently my father is telling my cousin that I should and my other cousins are fucking useless we should all die . I fucking hate him so much 
😭"
204,depression,It comes and goes-I “should” be happy,"I should just consider myself lucky that I don’t feel this way all the time. 

Why can’t I just stay happy? 

People always tell me that I “should” be happy. I have a job, I have a car, I have a house, I have a future (if I don’t decide to just fucking kill myself) but I’m not happy

I’m such a selfish piece of shit. I’ve gotten life on easy mode and I still wish I was fucking dead. I’m not worthy of any of this that I’ve been blessed with. 

No one seems to care or understand. I can be pleasant enough on the outside. I just don’t want people to know how much I’m dying on the inside. I don’t want to be a fucking burden, I just wish this would all go away 

I just lay here and have to cry myself to sleep all alone night after night and I’m sick of this stupid cycle. I want it all to end, just end already. 

Whether that be through some sort of medication to my brain, or a bullet to my brain, I just want this to stop"
205,depression,I just spent a full 14 hours rotting on my gaming pc like usual,"I hate it when it gets like this, when I have zero motivation to leave my room and instead spend a quite frankly lovely summer day doing fuck all in the dark.

As usual I ate basically a morsel of food that I could barely even taste while sitting home alone. I’m dangerously skinny for my height as a result of my lack of eating.

By the time I’m done with my 14 hour escapism sesh playing league of fucking legends I now just lay here feeling physically ill. Uninstalled it but we all know I’ll be right back on it tomorrow morning first thing…

I hate my job, I hate my life. I can’t sleep unless I take anti - depressant/anxiety medication that puts me to sleep. Been like that for as long as I can remember. Doubled edged sword since I feel like shit on the meds but of course I feel like shit if I don’t sleep.

It’s so frustrating seeing former friends from high school and college travelling and having fun. I’ve distanced myself from all of them and they’ve moved on. My circle has completely collapsed. I’m left with a group of friends who are hermits just like how I am now which doesn’t help with my gaming addiction.

It blows my mind to think about myself from 2019. Studying hard, awesome girlfriend, fun trips with family. And all that has been completely ripped away from me. Such a short time ago but I feel like a completely different person and a failure above all else."
206,depression,Is this a normal feeling?,"Back when I was in my teens and not depressed I felt like I can chase a goal or aim for something I want.

That was then and now I’m 25 and in M2 medical and ever since the depression started the only way to get myself to do anything is to have some kind of terrifying outcome chasing behind me: I no longer feel like I’m going anywhere,I am just running from a future I’d rather kill myself than experience. 

I have 1 option; pass medical school and STEP. I am too old for second chances and have no marketable skills or work experience so it’s either this or kill myself if I fail. I’ve already ingrained it into my head that if I don’t make it I die, and while the me being dead part doesn’t bother me; what my suicide would do to my parents is more than scary enough to chase me to work the necessary 10-12 hrs a day.

Just wanted to know if this kind of feeling of not working towards something but rather running from something without any goal is normal. 

Basically good news: I can usually scare myself into working

Bad news: still clinically depressed but now I have anxiety and give myself panic attacks"
207,depression,advice on meds,"just wanted to know how other peoples experience has been with medication. is it helpful? how are the side affects? and is it really worth it? 

i have been battling depression + anxiety for a while now, and it is getting to points where it is unbearable. i have bad mental breakdowns whenever i can’t hold it in anymore, have bad anxiety in the pit of my stomach. and i either sleep too much or not enough, i slept at 6 am the other day. i am curious if medication would help ease the depression, i have had other friends on it and they say it helps. but i am still on the fence, considering it is a somewhat long term decision."

209,depression,It never gets better,"Here I go again. Another depressive episode, another venting post on the internet. 

I feel completely hopeless. I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts constantly for the better part of 7-8 years. I swear, the only thing keeping me from total shutdown is that faint flicker of hope that things will get better. But they don't. I held on all through highschool, just telling myself, ""you'll get out of school, get a job, and start meeting people"". But it just isn't working out that way. I feel completely ostracized. Everytime I go anywhere, I stick out like a sore thumb. I'm 18, 6'3, 285 pounds. I have a wide frame thanks to my broad shoulders which just makes me that much bigger and unnatural. I wish I was just like 5'10 to 6 ft and bone skinny so I could blend in with society. Obviously, that's a bit set in stone tho. So I'm kinda stuck with it.

I have heard all the bullshit ""keep your room clean, try to be social, try to improve your self-image"". None of it works. I feel like I've done everything. I've gotten my hygiene under control and back to normal daily routines, I've lost 90 pounds in the last year and a half, I started getting more confident. But it all just hit me out of nowhere. I will never get better. I have done all this, and I'm still a complete social outcast. I was sitting here, daydreaming about a future with a wife and shit. Then I just snapped back and realized I'll never get that ending. I feel like my ending is joining the statistic when my hope finally runs out."
210,depression,I don’t know if I’ll ever heal from the feeling of betrayal,"I just got out of a 7 year relationship where my ex led me on about wanting to get married, withheld sex for over a year, and didn’t think I made enough money even though I worked full time 50 hours a week. When I finally told her that she needed to commit to me or be done with me, she said she wanted to take a break and that maybe we could get back together. Well on that break she hooked up with someone else, and said that her real reason for withholding a physical relationship was that she no longer felt emotionally attracted to me. I’ve since cut contact with her but I feel so betrayed. I don’t understand why she couldn’t just be up front with me. I feel like a worthless piece of garbage and that some random dude was more worthy of what she withheld from me who she was with for years. I don’t see why anyone would want me if I’m worthy of being treated like this."
211,depression,Does adopting a pet help?,"I applied to adopt a rabbit recently and I feel like I'm being too impulsive for many reasons.

It's a big responsibility and I don't want to mess it up.  I had rabbits before but we had to put them up for adoption a few years ago. I'm afraid the only reason I want one again is to be like an emotional support animal. 

I always assumed having a pet again would at least distract me from my constant depression and anxiety. But I'm also worried I won't be able to financially afford one. There's so much supplies and vet check ups to pay for. Idk if I'm ready to take the chance and adopt one. What if I'm only wanting this because I feel so low right now? Will it help me feel better somehow? 

All I know is I'm just so tired of feeling shitty and a rabbit would make me feel better rn."

Just upped and abandoned it all. Left when I was grocery shopping to her parents house. 

All of our families are shocked. She just said she couldn’t do it anymore. 

It makes no sense why she would commit and make all those long term plans so recently then just leave it all without even talking to me."

216,depression,"what is this, a world full of malice of hate and jealousy?","I hate, so much hate. So much so I hurt myself mentally not physically. The hate poisoning that which allows me to feel love. It's filled with hate and jealousy. I need to fix this but how is the question. A world where people can do easily drift one person to the next without a thought. A world where people think of themselves. Who, if anyone out there can truly be guilt free of this? Not once in their life?
So why? Why do we continue on? Why continue in this world that is full of greedy people? They say people will miss us. They tell us to try this that and the other, but we know it'll never help. So why, why do we continue, not for us not for others but the small shining glint of hope that maybe, just maybe things will get better. So all those who still have that spark let us consolidate and make a flame. We can be each other's family, a shoulder to cry on, people who can genuinely understand and relate to how you feel. 
Just know you are not alone, even if it seems the world is against you."
217,depression,I will never be truly fine,"Most think they won't get better but I know deep down I am doomed to a life of disappointment because my brain chemistry completely prohibits me from seeing anything but the negative parts of my life.

I have anxiety so my brain immediately jumps to the worst case scenario and my depression keeps me unenthusiastic and in a constant state of stress and panic over small things that I let tear away any shred of content I have left. This, including the fact my issues with connecting to people since I push people away when I get close to them makes me really damn lonely. It feels like people around me are nice but I'm nobodies favorite and my only use is to serve others for just a little validation or recognition and if I wasn't there someone else would be.

I have been good to my friends and always try to be the guy people can vent to because I want nothing more than for someone to actually give a shit about what I feel. My family cares, but all talking about it does is bring them down with me into my misery knowing there's no way to fix it. I don't have hobbies, I don't have friends, every time I try to fix this I fall back into the same spot where I simply wait until there's work for me to do.

I've done everything from therapy to medication and there just is no piece that fits. My only option is to continue this redundant existence until I no longer do exist. I have covered all the bases but yet again my brain won't let me leave behind my mental anguish."
218,depression,i can’t figure out what’s wrong with me,"Hi, 16M here. I’ve been diagnosed with an Anxiety and Depression Disorder and i’m on medication for it. these past few days i’ve had super low energy and even today i started randomly crying in the middle of class. i don’t understand i think i’m happy? I’ve been taking medication for 4 years now. I’m just super confused and idk how to explain it. Like right now i have no energy and just feel like dying, idk if it’s because im getting older and i have more responsibilities like with my job, or if it’s something mental health wise. I’m just depressed i guess? I wanna go back to how i was last week where i was happy and more relaxed."
219,depression,SNRI saved my whole life but caused a problem,"Suffering depression for 10 years, finally I started the cure on May. I'm now taking snri, and it helped me a lot. Like I wrote on the title, it saved my whole life. I now don't think much about suicide and death, less negative feelings and thoughts. It also saved me from ibs (maybe not ibs I don't know actual disease name) which was killing me every day for 24 years of my entire life.

So, I'm very satisfied with my pill now, and don't want to quit it.

But after taking this pill, I have a problem on erection. I feel horny every day just like I did before. But every time I try to solve it, mine doesn't get up well, and easily lay down.

Does anyone have problems like me? How do you solve it?"

away, what’s the point of being here, i am scared to talk to anyone because i hate the word no or being rejected, i am scared to talk to my father because he gets angry for no reason, i have to build my self up for a couple days before i even ask to hang out with a friend( i usually just say i’m busy or just never ask) , i never had many friends because i was never allowed to do what the other kids did, i am 16 and have to get in bed at 10pm, i am a teen who sits in bed for hours feeing anxious and sad all the time, i only feel slight happiness when gaming, gaming is the only thing i care about, if i never had a sister there’s a good chance i wouldn’t be alive right now, i hate living but i don’t want to commit suicide, if given the option to randomly not exist i would take it in a heartbeat, i hate the person i am, i miss the mother who passed when i was younger, sometimes i still never grasp that i will never be able to see my mother again, never get to hug her or talk to her or be her kid again, i wish i never existed, i hate that i do, late at night i always think i’m going to be productive the next day then i wake up with 0 motivation to do anything except play video games, what’s the point of doing something that you don’t feel, my dad has ruined my friendships in both online and in real life, i always told people my dad said no and while on a decent amount of occasions that was true but on other i was just to scared to ask him, my dad claims i can talk to him about anything and he won’t get mad but as soon as i mention something he doesn’t like hearing like about a bad grade or a missing homework assignment i instantly bashed and insulted, my dad has an excuse when i’m lazy and he says “your 16 and u can’t even do this” but i’m 16 and still have a bedtime, he wants me to act like a young adult but then he treats me like a kid, my dad claims all these things but then his true side comes out when something angers him, i hate my life, why did i have to be born, why?"

227,depression,I don’t know what to do,"Hey Reddit I currently don't have anyone to talk to
or open up to about this so i'll rant here. Life just
seems meaningless, I don't have the happiness or
drive like other people do to do everyday things. I
struggle every night with the thought of ""why
should i continue"" i don't know what's keeping me
going to be honest whether it's my fear of making
my family/friends sad or my random spurts of
inspiration to do better i don't know, but i just don't
see the point in life. I don't wanna wake up everyday
and work a 9-5 job and slave my life away just to
live. I don't find enjoyment in my current job nor do i
have any idea what i want to be in the future. I'm 17
almost 18 i dropped out of school and i'm just so
lost and scared. I put on a fake smile for people, i
don't want them to know something is wrong like
they can't even help anyway i don't even know if any
of you can idk if i need help or just to ramble or if i
do need help i don't know what help to get i'm

someone or just write it down."
228,depression,I don't want to leave.,My divorce will be happening soon.  A divorce that I don't even want.   I'll be moving out next week.  I've never been so distraught about anything in my life.  I'm losing my person and my home.  I feel like I'm destined to be alone.  I'm absolutely dreading that first night by myself in an unfamiliar place.
229,depression,Horrible anger with my depression.,"I’ve been having horrible ocd and been going through some depression because of it. Feeling horrible anger, I feel angry and everything and everyone. It feels like I wouldn’t care if anyone died, if bad things happens, I’m just drowning in anger and despair. I feel so horrible and guilty about it because I don’t want to feel this way, I know deep down I probably still do care obviously I do because I wouldn’t be so guilty or worried if I didn’t. I just hate feeling apathy and anger towards everything"
230,depression,What’s the difference between living in the moment and ascribing to what you should be doing in the moment ?,"Is living in the moment ambiguous w living in each moment? Ppl expect smth with every interaction they have. I think that it is a privilege to expect anything. 


Butttt you can expect more from ppl than the bare minimum right? Especially if you know that people are privileged to be in the situations that they’re in? 


Pretty philosophical but I’m curious"
231,depression,"My cousin just died, and I’m not sure what to do.","I just started college, and it’s already been a rough start, and I’m stressed all the time, I can’t seem to feel comfortable here. two days ago I got a call to say my cousin who I grew up with passed away, I feel destroyed, I wish I’d talked to him more in recent years, he texted me a few days before and I didn’t respond really, he was such a young man, early 30’s, I looked up to him in a way, he taught me to be nerdy and comfy with being nerdy, I cried for a hour when I found out and haven’t since, idk why, I am hurting, I just can’t produce the emotions, I’m scared, and so sad."
232,depression,Genuinely Hate for other People,"Is it just me, or is the majority of People out there just a bunch of unempathetic Clowns , who don´t deserve to live ?

Most of the People I've met, especially at work, where awful , aggressive and hateful to me. Talking shit behind my back or bringing up lies to my Superiors, so I would have an even worse Time there, then I have already.  In professional school during my apprenticeship, I´ve received a lot of Insults  for being overweight and ugly ect. Later on, a few of my Classmates found out that I took ant depressions and they´ve made fun about me even more. Saying that I´m a pussy or that i should just kill myself already.  
 

My so called ""friends"" abandoned me after they´ve recon  that I'm unable to go to big events anymore, because who could have thought, the depressed and miserable dude couldn´t go to Party's anymore ? After I told them everything about my current Situation, they didn´t even care.

My parents are ignorant C\*nts about that Subject ever since. Just coming up with the typical Statements like : ""there´re People, who suffer more then you"" or ""Man up already"".  They genuinely don´t care about my Situation. Probably never cared at all. 

I´am so done with people . I´am currently not working because I´m mentally  uncapable of doing so,  what isolates me even more.  I´ve become angry and nervous being around other People these days. The is just this desperate urge to flee from it all."

234,depression,Is it normal to have a blank mind?,"My mind feels blank. Someone is there, but it has nothing to say. It sounds dramatic, but it's what happens when I talk to people. Or try to do anything by myself. Maybe I'm just asking too much of me. For example: I used to love reading. I still do but I used to more. I can vividly remember books, what I felt, what I saw, why the author wrote this thing that way. I can grasp why an author did a certain thing this way, but if I practice it in a vacuum, nothing is retains. Or it feels that way. The same thing for visual art. I can see why an artist did a thing a certain way. I notice the small highlight there makes the whole thing whole. But if I sit down myself, nothing comes. The same with everything else. I don't know, I just feel like I'm in this weird inbetween of knowing the reality of things and then not being able to live in it myself. If that makes any sense. 

When I talk to people, they have this really interesting reality  where all this stuff happens, and things mean so much, and the world just seems interesting. But the same stuff could happen to me and I'd think nothing of it, or be unable to make a sotry out of it. Maybe I'm missing something, I'm not doing enough or haven't lived long enough, or don't pay enough attention to myself (even though I think about what I'm doing constantly), or what. I think about what the infamous Louie C.K said ""I'm just smart enough to know how dumb I am.""

What gives. Sometimes luck works out in my favor and I do something right. But most of the time whatever I do feels wrong."

236,depression,"Being lonely and depresses these few days, especially because of many movies delayed to 2023","I was usually a lurker here, but I really need to vent my stress and depression and I really need someone to talk to, I feel very depressed and lonely these few days and I felt that my mental health was getting worse in 2022, I only get to see my friends on weekends amd I cannot get to see them more often yet, which didn't really help matters because it led me to increasingly doubting and getting worried more and more about the state of my relationships, I became more lonely even until now, 
In these few weeks and days I browsed the internet and reddit and found out that Warmer Bros Discovery delayed many movies to 2023, Shazam: Fury of the Gods was delayed to March 2023 and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was the worst offender;delayed to December 2023, but worst of many was Salem's Lot, a new adaptation of Stephen King's famous horror novel was taken and pulled off schedule, I wanted to see Gary Dauberman and the cast and crew's output in this film but because of this, it grew fears and doubts in me of the film's eventual state. I was still trying to move on from Batgirl's cancellation and many people like me lamented Batgirl's cancellation, the dire current state of Warner Bros Discovery and its leadership that caused all of these delays. The CEO gave a massive middle finger to everyone involved in the film, especially the directors and Leslie Grace, the cast and the crew.
On top of that I am still trying to find job and income, the inflation and recession made my family's economic state unstable and worrying, and we really need income, I need a job and a steady income to support myself and my family, and these few months were the worst for everyone, if only I can find a steady income I would be much relieved
I'm sorry for this lengthy post but I really need relief and someone to talk to to feel better about nowadays, hope you all have a nice day."
237,depression,75-80 hours alone 5 days a week every week.,"It's one of those nights where everything is wrong but nothing is actually wrong you just look at you're life and say wtf.
 
I did the math tonight and 5 days a week give or take a few hours I spend 80 hours alone. Monday through Friday. There are 120 hours in 5 days. 80 hours is more than half that alone. This is not by choice either. I have a rare auto immune disease that makes physical movement impossible sometimes. It sometimes makes normal functions impossible. Driving is a rare privilege. And I spend most of my time in extreme pain. 
So adding being alone on top of this self resentment and limitations. Life sucks. 
My husband doesnt even engage with me when he is home. He either sleeps or hes so enveloped with his phone that he can't even recall the last two words i said to him. So even when he's home I'm alone (not added into the pervious math) 

Looking on the outside things are great. I have a roof over my head, a husband, lots of fur babies... but seriously I'm so sick and fucking tired of the pain and being alone. I'm looking through my phone who can I call and cry to.. no one.
so here I am reddit. My first post. My expectation is more silence, more people who don't actually care and leave me alone in the pit of darkness to."
238,depression,miserable,"The fact It's a miracle to be alive, to be on this planet, in this so called universe to exist for only a short amount of time and everyday I'm spending here in my room, isolated, lonely, no passions no dreams, no ""big"" end goals for myself. I know there was a certain point of my life I didn't feel this way, I wonder all the time; where did it all go wrong?  People always say you can change your life and find meaningful purpose at any instance if you work hard for it and I find it so aggravating.  I don't deserve to feel this isolated and hopeless, to have literally no friends, no interest in anything or to set a plan and get myself on the right track. the sadness never goes away its always there underlying its so suffocating.

I thought I was doing okay, then I had a breakup, then the thoughts came back. I've been in the hospital 2 times in the past year, I've done IOP, I've been in therapy two years now, I've been med compliant for over a year, and I'm still just wondering what's it all for. 
I don't feel like committing suicide, but I just can't help but feel all of this work is meaningless and for nothing. What's the point of forcing myself to live if life just feels unfulfilling and dull and empty. It's like I have nothing to even look forward to. Everyday is just getting everything over with. I hate it.
I do no know anyone where I live very well and we've rarely talked. It feels uncomfortable to open up to them. I'm kinda just barely okay. I'm alone. And I can't really talk to anyone because none of them have known me for more than a few conversations. 
And I'm trying to be friends with my ex, and somedays it's okay, but I can't help but worry all the time that he's just being formal. Like he doesn't actually want me around.
Everything just sucks
I want to not live like this. I want to have something to make all of this effort feel meaningful.

255,depression,I really don’t make good friends,"Is it me or them?  I dunno. I’ve just been having issues lately. My son argued with me about money, took my babysitting privileges away, things escalated and I haven’t seen his family in 2 months. 

Meanwhile I was upset about that and my friend kept doing dick moves when it came to dumping our plans for his girlfriend. Here I just wanted hang time once in awhile but he either has to try to drag her into it or dump me for her. I got sick of it and he chose her. He was a primary support. 

A friend with whom I was fairly close pre-pandemic but drifted away from, they decided my Facebook was too negative and defriended me. 

One friend suddenly blocked me on fb and phone. This person was chosen family. As in we literally celebrate Christmas together and shit. He said something about Facebook (I think he was referencing me being mad at the friend from earlier) and said he needed to “work on himself.”  But you don’t just ghost someone you’re that close with. 

And finally Greg is an asshole. My car got stolen and he literally told me it was my fault. Fuck Greg. 

I basically have one close friend/support left. So as not to fuck things up, I probably need to get a bit of space in there."
256,depression,Is this depression?,I think relationships with other people are too stressful. There have been events to make me think this way. Like why do I keep trying? I don’t have any family. My mom is dead and my dad is a huge a hole. I joined the military and made great friends now we never talk. Had girlfriends but all of them cheated. It’s just what’s the point? Being sad and alone seems to be better than being happy in the moment of something fake. I don’t think two people can have an honest intention of caring for each other

262,depression,I'm not sure why,"So I've been detached from life for a very long time. I thought I was good since I would anyway have my dissociation and disinterest to just carry me through and get the basics done like a job, maybe an average relationship, and just enough energy to go through the motions. Hell, maybe even occasionally enjoy some things too. But recently, something that would not seem very big in the grand scheme of things happened, and I've completely spiralled into feeling panicky, lost, feeling restless while doing anything, finding even the basic tasks overwhelming. I'm not sure if I'm even articulating this right, but these feelings are standing on top of an underlying feeling of complete and total tiredness. Its like they've have sprung up from the numbness and I feel both together. I don't know if this is normal..! Does anyone else feel this way? Or has anyone else who was numb suddenly started feeling very panicky, lost and restless?"
263,depression,Wallowing,I’m sinking into the pain and I’m letting my brain tell me I’ve ruined my life. I’ll never be happy. I’m not sure why but I’m ok with that truth. Just going to sit in the pain. I want to cut. What do I do?
264,depression,Nothing to Look Forward to,"I grew up abused (NPD parents), not close with any siblings, immigrated to a different country to be away from my stressors. Have spent years (and will probably a lifetime) working on myself just to feel normal.

Things were good for a while (Okay job, I have my gf of 15 yrs). But I am childfree, recently tried to get a dog and failed miserably, realized I don’t have the mental energy. These lately I’ve been feeling aimless and stuck, like I don’t know why I’m here and it’s a struggle everyday just to feel normal.

Gf also feels more like a roommate than a romantic partner. She refuses to see therapist to work on our problems. My relationship was the only thing that worked in my life. Now it’s no longer the case and I just feel there is nothing to look forward to. Sure, I can travel, get a hobby, but in the back of my mind I always ask ‘what’s the point?’

I don’t think I’m that suicidal but I often think if there is a way to end my life easily and without pain, it would not be the most tragic thing. I know people who know me might feel shocked or miss me for a while, but then life goes on."
265,depression,where is my mind?,[removed]
266,depression,I think I’m finally done. I hate myself and everything I do. I just ruin everyone’s life eventually with self-sabotaging things I don’t feel like I have control over.,"I’ve felt depressed for as long as I can remember. I’ve lost contact with my family due to my parents abusing me throughout childhood. My grandmother (who really was more of a parent than either of mine were) died a few months ago and my parents prevented me from seeing her when she was dying. I’ve lost contact with a lot of my friends because I am barely surviving day-to-day. Not just mentally but financially I am just gone. I can’t even call it living paycheck to paycheck because i have to ration when I eat towards the the end of the month. 

My partner just left me, for good reason and I just feel this is another in a long line of repetitive failure. I just fundamentally don’t think I can cope without them. Im obviously not telling them this because I feel it’s selfish to. 

I just can’t live like this anymore. Nothing is going to undo the trauma I struggle with constantly. It’s hard to trust anyone has my best interests at heart even when they definitely do. I have ruined every single relationship i’ve had at this point and I’m done waiting to be struck by lightning."
267,depression,got out of depression + anxiety and here's how,"I started to notice how every time I was sad, anxious, or angry, it was because I was using too much of my head. In other words, I was overthinking too much, like right now. Then, I stopped thinking and could see, hear, feel, smell, and taste again. It was like thinking blocks your entire view of what's going around.

I went outside, and put my attention to how everything sounded. Even the cars, dogs barking, and the wind blowing all sounded equally peaceful. This all helped me stop thinking sexually, be happy consistently, and be way more productive.

A mindset I started to apply was not allowing myself to be sad ever again. When I feel slightly sad, straight up just said to myself 'no, I won't let myself be sad ever again.'

There are people who just want to be sad such as myself before. For those, do what makes you happy more often. If you have no clue, look around and try as much things as you can. I hope I could help"
268,depression,why do I feel this,"I can't shake this feeling of being lonely, but I have people to love and care about. It could be my family is spread out across America. I don't think that's it though. I went back to watch a show I used to watch with my brother and cried the whole time. Ugh, I just want things to be like the past again when me and my brothers hang out."
269,depression,I'm losing it,"Everyday is like a nightmare to me until nighttime hits, then my anxiety skyrockets and my depression takes a nap. it's always a dual fight between the two and I feel so exhausted about living more days to come. I have high ambitions but I feel so worthless that I feel like I shouldn't even bother achieving them. I feel irritated by everyone and everything, I fucking hate talking to people at this point.
everything is starting to make me gag, people being optimistic, marriage, shitty self care, fucking careers. it makes my stomach churn. Why do people do it
I don't want to live another 50 pathetic years before I rot in my grave, I want out while the wound is fresh.
I don't know. lately I just feel sick, metaphorically and physically. I can't stand life and whatever the fuck it's about.
These mundane tasks give me fucking cancer.
I don't want to fucking cook and eat and shit and take a shower and run shitty errands.
I have no control over my emotions anymore, one minute I'm crying my eyes out, the next I have a little hope then all goes downhill again until I start being a nervous wreck and weirdly give a fuck about lame human society stuff. 
I zone out to such an extent that I cant hold a two minute conversation

274,depression,Hi could you help me,"this I am not sure where to go with this but I’ve been struggling for a really long time, I uh don’t know how to word it all but basically I don’t know what to do? Like in a general sense of living


As a kid my dad was pretty abusive and I ended up with anger issues that I got therapy for as a kid, anyways he got increasingly more abusive until I started standing up for myself and fighting him back ( physically and by threatening to call the police) and my mom I thought really loved me as a kid but as I grew older she became more and more verbally abusive , one that really stuck by me was when she told me she could never love me because I couldn’t behave like a normal kid ( I think I have adhd ) I couldn’t tell u because I never got tested for anything since my parents “don’t  believe in that’s stuff”. (Also for a really long time I had a hatred for my skin colour since I got made fun of it in like grade 1 by a white kid) but I’m over that (it took a long time though). anyways here are the problems that arose from that. 
am extremely toxic to the people around me, I drag them down and hurt them but I don’t mean to, I don’t know why I do it it just happens. and the thing so do become increasing more and more unforgivable and cruel and mean and disgusting (I would explain in further detail but you’d also hate me like I hate myself )  I rarely try to get girlfriends because when I do I am manipulative and dismissive, when I have crushes I become creepy and obsessive. I put my friends down and hurt them and break their trust, i also never reach out to any one  (unless I want something from them) but I’ve worked on this in particular  a bit since everyone has complained about it, (I feel even though I’m a bit sensitive I am very open to criticism). i want to know how to become a better friend/lover if you could help ?

Secondly I have rejected every open opportunity because I feel I am not worthy of them (also for some reason every time I openly talk about these opportunities them magically and randomly always fall through?) (like they just disappear completely?) and for some reason I can’t keep a job because I always fall through with commitment and also just being a general  dumbass (I would tell you my stories but they’re extremely specific and if anyone I knew read them they would instantly know it’s me (like on the level of reading a “Florida man….” You know it’s bad and very weirdly stupid and specific. Like these are very costly mistakes or very stupid mistakes that no ordinary person with half a brain would make, and I am very ashamed of them so I don’t actively go out and look for a job anymore (I’m a neet) 


Thirdly, I said I was good at school as I was but I never tried to go into university or anything similar because I don’t really want an actual job ( I don’t want to work till I’m old) also there was never really Anything that particularly interested me depending on my mental state I could say I equally enjoy/hate everything and anything. and if it died I would probably need to upgrade since I basically stopped showing up my last year of school and dropped 2 of my sciences because I became extremely depressed  (even though the were my easiest subjects) and got  60s in la and social (I did no assignments at all the entire year) (I still got 90s in math and calc because there was a rule that your assignments would be filled by your test mark.  I don’t hate school I just hate the idea of working in general so I didn’t go to uni or any thing like that (I would be open to the idea but I don’t really know where to start or how to look for something I’d enjoy ) 

The main problem I have is that for some reason  everytime I try at something it fails and explodes in my face, that harder I try the more it ends up backfiring,  then I give up  and 3 months later after a lot of pep talk I try and and the cycle repeats itself and I go back to into a depressive episode, I can’t seem to make any progress in my life no matter how hard I try and I don’t know why, it also feels like everyone is looking down on me now cuz they  see I haven’t accomplished anything and I always get asked “what are you song with your life?”

For reference I am 20  have no job no car I don’t go to school I am not particularly good a anything I have no hobbies I mostly just spend my time jerking off in my room (I do go to the gym but I don’t particularly see the big thing about getting muscles or anything I just do it because I heard it suppose to help even though it really hasn’t done anything for me (expect make me look bigger I guess) like I said before even though I’m not particularly  attractive or anything I’m pretty short too I have never really struggled getting attention from girls but I don’t seem to be able to work up past initial attraction anymore ( I’ve been holed up So long I forgot how to have normal conversation  or flirt or make comebacks or anything like that, I think I am still funny because people seem to laugh when I talk but maybe it’s because they’re laughing at me idk :(. I should probably mention my friend are kind of all growing more apart  from me (distancing  themselves) I don’t blame them because I’m kind of a loser that just annoys and hurts them.

Anyways bro or broette thank you for listening to my rant but my question is how do I fix myself? I have all these relay internalized problems that I don’t really know how to fix? i don’t really doubt myself but I conditionally judge myself for just living? I can only hope that it’s gonna work out for me but I don’t really know where to start anything? Also I want to say that I know my childhood trauma doesn’t excuse anything i do or have done but I just don’t know how to be better (everyone has baggage but it shouldn’t affect the people around you) I just need help on improving? and I’ve made mistakes that are unforgivable but how do I move on from them? And how do fix a relationship I’ve broke with a friend after I did something unforgivable but they still forgave me? Also i am not trying to hyperbol anything or blow anything out of proportion everything I wrote is what I think is to scale/realistic."
275,depression,"I just can't study math alone, almost every time i do so i just think about suicide","I feel extra dumb for this, it's embarrassing i couldn't fix it for years, because of that i failed school several times, like when i do programming and computer science in a way my neurons are fine, but some reason i already struggle with my mental health since i have a bunch of issues with getting more than 2 people interact with me at the same time and a bunch of other things i just don't get, i just can't get an hold on myself, it doesn't make any sense

It's kinda depression but it goes from entire months in from days yes and no and just straight up nothing, very random, i just can study a few subjects i have passion for 

Maybe I'm just stupid, no idea"
276,depression,I just feel like I can’t breathe anymore,"Idk what to say… everything’s going so fast and I can’t keep up. The mental stress itself is eating me alive much less the obstacles ahead. Some people believe in me but I think I polluted their views on me. Right now as I’m writing this I feel as though I keep getting these weird waves of not being in touch with reality? Idk how to put it. It’s like a haze. Also it just feels like I’m being left in the dust. Idk if I want to get better cause it’s something I’ve known for so long, as bad as that sounds. But I’m so tired. I genuinely can’t take it anymore. A friend of a person ik committed suicide due to the same reason I’m currently stressing right now. I see it now, well Ig ive understood it from before but I actually FEEL how bad it is. I’ve also realised that no matter how much I speak about it, no one can ever remove this tumour. Im practically being poisoned slowly. I sort of called it though. Whether it was me being psychic or it was a self fulfilling prophecy, it just might lead me to my life being ruined before it even started.  It’s this weird concoction of fear desperation and a lot of hopelessness all mixed into one. I don’t think I would recognise myself if the me of 2 years ago saw the me of today. I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know what to do. It’s raining right now. I like the rain. But I know it will come back to me. And it will cripple me and render me immobile once again. I want to be like *them* but it feels sort of impossible. They will never understand. I just want to be free. Not tethered to some self constructed void that draws away any remaining life force that I might still call mine. But what even is mine anymore. Who *am* I anymore. Everyone looks for happy endings, but I think that’s too unrealistic and jubilant. Maybe life doesn’t always have happy endings. Maybe we should just learn that, and maybe then we will be a bit more free."
277,depression,How does depression affect your relationships?,"Depression affects everyone differently. I’ve struggled with trauma-related depression off and on for nearly half my life. For me, with regards to relationships, it can impact my ability to get close to people because of trust issues and low self-esteem. It doesn’t impact my ability to fall in love and continue to experience deep feelings of love. So when I start feeling the urge to isolate myself, I pretty much exclusively withdraw from friends and turn to my partner and family for support.

My last partner was different. He also suffers from depression and it’s prevented him from figuring out what he wants to do in life and then doing it. And it seems like because of that, he has trouble feeling strong feelings of love, to the point that he constantly questions his feelings in relationships and only realizes after it’s over that he loved that person. When he’s really struggling, he wants to run away. On the other hand, he has no trouble connecting with more “superficial” relationships (acquaintances, not-close friendships).

I would like to know, how does depression impact your relationships with people?"
278,depression,what is this fuckery,"why does depression actually just suck ass. when u get out of an episode you feel like you might be actually acquired the skills to know how to not fall into another one again but no. this shit just happen a over and over and over and over again. I'm sick of getting my hopes up and finally feeling like I could live, when another episode happens and you are literally back at square fucking one. I'm tired."
279,depression,Helping an introverted friend with depression/ASD,"A friend of mine, who has been diagnosed with depression and ASD, rarely leaves their house (they are at an online school), except to spend time with me and my friends. They have some good online friends they spend time with online, but never IRL.

When my depression was more severe, spending time with friends IRL not only alleviated my depression in that moment, but for some time after. They might be an introvert, but I can't imagine that never seeing anyone face-to-face except for your parents (who they don't have the best relationship with) is healthy or beneficial to anyone's mental health, even if you have autism, right?

Now to the immediate problem: Every time something is slightly different/uncomfortable about the (weekly) meeting with my friend group, they say they don't want to come anymore. Examples include: someone else (from the friend group) has to pick them up, someone they don't know as well joins, we have to play a different game because too many people are missing, their depression is worse than usual, and so on.

Most of the time I can convince them to come anyways, and most of the time they seem to be completely fine. They say this is because they are masking their discomfort, and they say that they are exhausted after the social interaction, and that might be true. 
Now my question (and I hope especially that some introverted, depressed people with ASD can chime in): Do you think that it's still a net-positive to meet your IRL friends? How much of their initial unwillingness to come is cloudy judgement because of depression/social anxiety? Is it actually better for them to sit in their house all day, covers shut with depressed thoughts?

I really want to help them, but I don't know if I'm doing it right."
280,depression,I feel like I don't belong in human society,"I don't know what else to say about it or I have too much to say. Basically I don't know how to have close friend and have never been in a relationship. I don't like the way they work but still feel inadequate for being the only one not participating. In short I just feel so fucking lonely and am afraid I'll never experience love or intimacy or anything like it, and it all seems to come so easily to everyone else. Anyway I'm feeling low today and it's nice to vent here instead of bothering the few people willing to talk to me."
281,depression,Is there such thing as weather depression not just seasonal depression?,"Can anybody relate to having depressive episodes directly related to the weather on a particular day? 

I’m aware of seasonal depression but my understanding is this is caused by a period/season of darker colder weather which repeats each year in a cycle. 

For me (36/m/UK) a single dark and wet day can send me into a big depression whereby I feel zero enthusiasm or hope about life. I’m just floating in a trance through the day and cannot even imagine there being another sunny day in the future. Straight away I’m thinking I need to live in a warmer climate and fixate on planning where I’m going to move to. 

This week has been a prime example in the East of England. We’ve had gorgeous weather and I’ve been on top of the world. Bouncing out of bed each day, exercising, eating well, etc. then yesterday was a very dark, cold day and I just felt awful. However today is bright and sunny again and I’m perfectly fine and cannot understand how I was that awful person yesterday. 

Can anyone relate? Is this a known disorder? 

I’m a smart guy, I’m well read about depression and I’ve had a tonne of therapy over the years so I understand the theory behind how our surroundings effect our mood and techniques to lessen the impact, but this is something that seems so overpowering. Nearly everywhere in the world has winters, and those places that don’t will have awfully hot summers. There is no perfect place to live, but that awareness doesn’t seem to help. 

TLDR: Can seasonal depression actually present in a more short term form of daily weather depression?"
282,depression,My brain is a broken mess,"I’m breaking people. I can’t stop posting about my issues. I can’t stop thinking about how great one year or so was better and I was happy. 

I have ADD, health anxiety that patting  myself down with every jolt of the head in fear of a concussion (my brain is too broken for me to chance breaking it even more). 

I also have Depression.

I just can’t take waking up into a world of boring rejection. My hobbies reject me, my friends somewhat reject, my mind rejects me.
If I was to kill myself, my family and, if they exist, god would reject me.

I try to reject me my reality on a daily basis but it’s just so hard when your brain is so unbelievably unmendable that you can barely read your own name or the description to a show you’re interested in. 

Idk"
283,depression,My life,"I go to work at 7:40am and push carts for 7 hours in the summer weather. No time to socialize just carts. I go home tired. I don’t have anyone right now. I really want relationships and human connection and I got the balls to try to reconnect with an old friend but I could tell by their lack of questions and dry responses that they’re not interested. I feel I dont have value as a person. That’s why nobody wants to be around me. I have passions but im too tired, too much of a loser to get up and do them which just makes me more depressed. Ive been in therapy for 9 months and I doesn’t help at all. Every day just makes me more frustrated and mad. It looks so easy for everyone else."

285,depression,I am planning at some point to no longer exist thanks to my profession as a teacher. I just don’t know when or how yet.,"
Been dealing with a lot of shitty stuff at work and my job is in limbo.  I made a long post yesterday about being the subject of an investigation that I ended up deleting because I was legally advised to in case it turned against me.  I’m afraid of letting everyone down, even though I know I did nothing that was criminal or worth losing my job over.  However, unfortunately we live in a society where people want to shoot first before they hear your side of things. It’s a long story that I don’t really want to get into again.  My family and friends know I’m depressed and want to be supportive, but I don’t really think they know how bad it is.  I’ve been seeing a therapist and PA that prescribes me meds but I cannot say it’s been helping. When I choose to stop existing, I would like to get it done as quickly and as painlessly as possible. In the end, we’re just meaningless and replaceable and I’ve become discouraged from wanting to continue, because I can’t trust anyone anymore.  It’s going to feel embarrassing to return if/when hopefully everything works out because who knows what students and staff have been saying about me throughout this time reassigned.  If people knew how to communicate an issue to begin with and not go behind someone’s back and put their livelihood on the line, life would be so much easier, but people have to panic and treat everything as if it’s some federal incident.  Now I’m stuck in limbo in a corrupt and slow bureaucratic system that is indifferent to the well-being of its schools and teachers.  I feel that if I resign it will make me look guilty.  I feel there’s no other way out of this.  I am sorry."

If I tell my psychiatrist that i have a plan to commit suicide (overdosing on sleeping pills) and the means to do it, but I'm currently not actively suicidal nor do I intend to proceed with the plan (as of right now), would I be forcefully detained in a hospital?

292,depression,possible reunion with childhood bff,"Today I met her mom by chance, dad and I were eating at a stall and suddenly a woman came to our table. She introduced herself and I can barely recognize her, it has been at least 15 years since I last saw her. I'm friend with her oldest child while my younger sister is friend with her younger child. My sister is still in contact with her friend while I lost all contact. The reason being we don't have phones back then. We went to different secondary school and life just goes on I guess.

So now we're both in the late twenties and haven't been in contact since primary school. She has had a great life from what I hear. She went to elite secondary school, studied oversea, have a great job probably. The siblings are all successful people. My sister is successful too.

I don't feel like contacting her because how can I explain how my life turned out. I'm depressed and unemployed. I used to be a bright kid but my performance declined because of depression I guess. Many things happened to me, I was bullied, humiliated, etc so I became depressed. Her mom asked for my number so she could give me her daughter's number. I saved her number but I don't know what to do with it. So now her mom has my number and if I don't contact her, she'll probably give my number. Her mom said she'll be happy if I contacted her because she has no friends if she's back in town. She lives like 12 hours away from our hometown.

I don't even know what I want to hear from you guys, but any feedback is welcomed. You could share your similar stories or any advice/input. Thank you."
293,depression,Depressed but restless and agitated?,"I've had severe depression for 4 years (20F) and go through very low spells where I feel v suicidal and down and fairly low in energy but push through. Prior to or following these periods I get very restless and agitated for days/weeks. I can manage on only a few hours of sleep and feel ok, I feel very restless and shaky like I have lots of energy and need to just go for a long run or do a workout or something to burn the energy otherwise I get so restless I need to self-harm instead because it feels like sm built up negative emotion. Sort of like a fight-flight response all the time with no trigger. Or like i've had loads of caffeine constantly. It's hard to direct it into something positive because underlying this is negative thoughts. 
This makes it a dangerous cocktail of having strong urges and the energy to act on dangerous thoughts. 
This does pass after a week or so though and i go back to normal/a bit slower to my usual depressed state. 
This is when I need much more sleep and feel slow and lethargic but still carry on as usual. 
Does anyone else have these periods of high energy anxious-like feeling?"
294,depression,I’m just so tired,"I’m so tired, I can’t deal with reality. I don’t want to be present, so I’m constantly spaced out. I’ll do anything to escape. Drugs are my release. I know I’m hurting myself I just can’t stop, I don’t want to face the real world. I want to rot in bed, but I can’t. I study and I work. Then with 10 hours to spare at the end of my day, I smoke myself to sleep. I’m just so tired. All I seem to do is fantasise of death."

297,depression,37 living my worst year.,"I just turned 37.
My mom was diagnosed with cancer in 2021, she fought it but it returned aggressively in February this year. It got so bad the Doctors said there was nothing they could do and her days were numbered. 
Thinking about the pain and suffering my mom was enduring and how my sister was the one taking care of her and her family and how hard that has been for her. These things put me in to a great depression and I started having strong hatred to how cruel the world is and dove deep into nihilism.
My wife decided that she had had enough of my depression and that she wasn't going to let me drag her down with her, she left in April. Last week my mom was admitted to the hospital for Palpative care, this week my sister is telling me she may not live out the week. I have been trying to face time with my mom as much as I can but her pain medicine pretty much keeps her sedated and it is rare I can get a conversation that lasts more than 5 minutes. 
I live over 3000km away from my family I'm here alone. Always alone. I won't make it out in time to see her one last time before she passes I visited her in April and again in may, I feel so isolated and like a terrible son.
I feel empty inside like my soul left a long time ago and I'm just an automaton. Every day I ask my self what's the point I still want to try but how to go on after losing everything you hold dear? I wish I could see my mom one last time."

301,depression,I’m the worst.,"Unintentionally, I ruin a lot of things. I’m not very smart. I’m inconvenient, and an emotional hazard.

I have severe social anxiety, and chronic depression - and it bums everyone out around me. I try to keep it hidden and put on a face because that’s what I’ve been taught and I hate the thought of causing issues for other people. I try my best to be normal but I can only fake it for so long. I ruin relationships and friendships, social gatherings, jobs.. the more I type this out, I know it just sounds like I’m feeling sorry for myself. I don’t know how to change. I have flaws and I try to work on them, but nothing seems to get better. I currently take a strong antidepressant - but it crushes me that I have to depend on a pill that will alter my brain for the rest of my life (you know, for the better - but that itself is a depressing thought.) 

I just wanted to tell someone. Even if that someone is a black void in a corner of the internet. 

I’m currently sitting in the car at a concert because I couldn’t handle it. I feel pathetic and like I ruined everyone’s night because I needed to run away. I’m the worst."
302,depression,How do I do this,I’ve felt awful and never known how to ask for help how do you tell your parents you can’t feel happiness or love?

How do I ask for help?
303,depression,How do I get my best friend to stop crying when I ask him difficult things?,"So, recently, my best friends and I moved in together and it's been fun, other than the fact he kinda cries every time I ask something of him?

He will let dishes pile up, not change the litter box, etc, but when I ask him to do it, he cries and says he's ""trying to change."" I'm really not sure how to help motivate him or help him with his chores? Our entire house is a mess and he doesn't seem like he wants to help at all and it's making my depression worse."
304,depression,I can't write anymore,"Used to be suicidal and unemployed, until I decided I wanted to write a novel before I die. They told me being employed would magically fix me so I threw myself into the workforce, thinking I could take the rainbow bridge to mental wellness and then I could be a novelist.

Was in a high-stress and decently-paying job for a few years. Bought my own placed and moved out. It was nice. The downside was that I couldn't write. When I was off from work I was too tired and braindead to do anything worthwhile. That's OK, I'll save up for a few more years and then take some time off for my passion. This fantasy kept me going.

Then was laid off. I had money set aside and could claim EDD. I rented out the house and moved back with my parents' for additional financial cushion. Everything was in place. Except. I couldn't write.

Everything I put on the paper is so dead and spiritless. If I picked a book off the shelf and found my own writing inside, I wouldn't make it past the first 5 pages. Drier and staler than cereal you forgot to seal and left in the cabinet. I look at my own writing from before - during HS, during college, during the worst of my depression, and it's clear I've lost whatever skill I had before. Now I am mediocre on a good day.

My parents are screaming at me to get a job. I do pay them rent, but it's not about the money. They are afraid if I remain unemployed, I will go back to being lazy and unmotivated (and eventually, broke).

Joke's on you. I was always unmotivated. I just realized the carrot is no longer hanging on the stick. Don't know what to do with myself now."

I can't do any simple task to help out around the house without getting stressed out and wanting to just go back to sleep.  I get into arguments all the time with my Mom about how lazy I am and how I don't do anything around the house, but I know they're right. I don't like doing anything.

Every social interaction is terrifying, and having conversations with people is a daunting task. 

This summer I didn’t do a single thing. I could have gotten a job, but I have my last year of high school in August, so I didn’t want to do both. I could have worked on self improvement or work on friendships, but I didn’t. Instead I just lazed about, playing games and feeling sorry for myself.

This USA is completely divided, a man-eats-man world, where the only way to gain political power is to trash the ""other side"" like they're the enemy. I thought we were supposed to be one nation. 

I'm in school for a good degree, have a job with growth potential, a loving boyfriend, good friends, and good family. But when I think about it, I don't think any of it is worth the anguish I feel living on this earth. I just think I don't care about how anyone felt about me being gone. Or maybe I would hope certain people would feel guilty if I was gone.

I tried therapy. Doctors don't care. They just need to pad their pockets. And regular healthcare is not affordable for me. I just don't trust doctors of any kind. I feel guilty dumping my emotions on others. My boyfriends always gets so sad when I'm sad. He feels like he needs to help me but he doesn't know what to say or do. My best friend has struggled with depression longer than I have, and my episodes are negatively affecting our relationship because she shuts down and I lash out. It's not fair to either of them.

Nothing makes me happy. It feels hopeless. I feel so alone. No one can handle me. No one can support me. And I feel guilty that I even expect support. No one deserves to have to deal with my shit."

314,depression,This thought has been in my head and I need some insight,You have depressing and embarrassing thoughts. You are lonely but refuse to do anything about it. Your friend who you barely talk to can hear them. You realize after a while and refuse to change. Your friend begins to hate and mock you. They are overbearing.They harass you 24/7 and accuse you of acting like a child. Who is at fault?

317,depression,Depression when everything is fine,"I'm not sure how the post will come across, as I know there is people in this sub that are truly struggling with real problems. So, as the title says, how do you handle depression when everything around you seems to be okay? 

Everything in my life seems okay, I have a family that cares, good friends, a girlfriend, a job that I like (for the most part), financial stability, hobbies, a house. However, I feel pretty miserable. I been breakdowns every couple of days where something will just trigger me and I start crying and I can't stop the emotions. I'm also struggling to do chores so I been out of  clean dishes, and food, for over a week (I been managing to pick up food at least once per day). 

It's not that I take anything for granted either. I come from an immigrant family and we struggled a lot when moved here. I understand how lucky I am to have everything I have, but it just doesn't seem to matter. Sometimes I look at other people and they seem to be able to be happy/satisfied regardless of their circumstances. I don't feel like I need my life to improve in anyway, but I'm still miserable. Anyone have a similar experience?"
318,depression,"Please, I want something good to happen to me",I need something. I want something to make me feel good. When was the last time I was happy? I'm either doing 'bad' or 'tolerable.' I need to feel good. I can't do this without something good happening to me. Is anger also a symptom of depression?
319,depression,What should I watch?,What are the best top 10 animes/ regular movies/shows I  should Watch before I hitch a ride onto the bus?
320,depression,I feel so trapped,"Im 20. Can’t drive (working on it and hate myself it’s taking this long). I don’t have a job and hate myself for it (looking for a remote job because my last job caused a mental breakdown.. I feel pathetic). Everyone I used to be friends with have drifted away (expected but still painful). I live with and love someone who is rarely emotionally available (he was raised that way and I have a hard time accepting it). I want so desperately to talk to someone for hours and hours about life and mental health with someone who gets it for once. I feel so alone. I can’t afford therapy. Can’t vent to the people I love. Idk what to do. I want to sink in a hole and disappear forever. I keep asking myself whether or not I’m in the middle of another depressive episode and I have no fucking clue. My (ex) best friend used to know how to ground me and bring me back from this hell. I’m tired. I’m angry. I’m desperate. I’m alone.

I want to give up."
321,depression,I need to get this out here,"My past few days have been some of the hardest of my life. There are moments of happiness and pure bliss but i constantly feel as if I am drowning. Not in pain or suffering, but the feeling of pure emptiness and nothingness. Being with friends, drinking, video games, nothing has been helping and i have to plaster on a fake smile and pretend that I am fine. There have been moments where I have considered suicide but the knowledge of the pain and suffering I would put my family and friends through has made me reconsider. I have started self harm again to help stop the emptiness but it seems to work for only a few moments before I lose all feeling again. I don’t know if anyone can help but I am attempting to ask for it in the hopes i can remain anonymous."
322,depression,Feeling like it’s now or never,"I’m fed up, I can’t stand this anymore. It’s like I’ve failed every aspect of my life and the stresses are reaching a breaking point. This is the lowest I’ve been in a very long time and there’s only one mode of control that I still have, it’s the only thing I love been thinking about. Part of me doesn’t want things the ease up because it’s like I won’t get this chance again. 

I’m at my absolute lowest of lows, I’m 26, I haven’t had a girlfriend in a very long time, my friendships are all fading and it’s not even like I could utilize friendships well anyway. My brain is absolutely fucked, I’m an introvert with, ADHD, depression and anxiety so my thoughts are a constant jumble of misdirected garbage, can’t even look people in the fucking eye. I feel like this is it for me, I have no hobbies and all I can’t do to cope is fucking smoke weed on my days off.

When I’m working I’m your average asshole who makes one and two day deliveries possible if you catch what I’m saying, everyone I know has surpassed me in every way and management picks on me and gives me the worse jobs on the site. Why don’t I switch jobs you ask? I can’t, that would require a license that I don’t have and the reason I don’t have that is because I’m so mentally unstable that I lock up during driving and nearly cause accidents. 

Am I a person with no hope? If you don’t think so then what then? I can’t even get psychiatric care because I can’t afford it, my family has always been poor and this job gives me what is basically pennies for what state I live in.

I’m so fucked, I’m stuck and I see no way out. I’m embarrassed to even exist and I feel embarrassed now even typing this. It’s like I’m a concoction of failure, like I was made to suffer. I don’t know why I’m even alive, I can’t even fathom dying or existing like this any further. The pain is unreal and I can’t even cry. I’m absolutely fucked."

324,depression,A Depressed Partner,"As the title stated, this post isn’t about myself but my partner in question who suffers from persistent depression disorder.

A few things to get out of the way, this is a long distance relationship that is quite far.

We’re both minors with myself being 17 and him being 16.

With that out of the way, today has been a difficult evening as he confessed he’s harmed himself and is having trouble with his urges. This conversation continued with him explaining that he’s suicidal and doesn’t want my support and basically telling me he’s a burden and I should get rid of him. To the best of my abilities and in the heat of the moment I tried to tell him my stance and my experience with people in my life killing themselves and ultimately he explained how keeping people who’re mentally unwell alive is only making them more miserable, and he doesn’t blame me for holding onto hope.

It’s been 2 hours since things died down and he presumably went to bed. But honestly I’m not sure what to do but keep fighting as I know deep down inside if anything happens to him. I’ll never be the same.

TLDR, I’m just looking for advice and some perspectives."

326,depression,I need help I don’t know how or who to help me.,"To begin I know there are people physically in worse places than me people are going through worse shit. 

I don’t know if that’s a bad thing to think but I think it.

I lie a lot about my happiness and I make this image of “having it all figured out” to the point where a lot of my friends come to me for advice some even look up to me and have told me that. 

Im in school to
Be a dentist I want a degree in biomedical sciences or microbiology.
I just had to leave a loving relationship of 3 years to chase my dream but I know there where a lot of things wrong with that relationship I knew she lied to me about a lot of things but she also loved me so much she didn’t want to hurt my feelings she wanted me to feel special. I knew about these lies for a long time and I would just push it away but then it got close to us having to leave to move to New York for school and in her culture to go anywhere outside of her house with a man you must be married.

Mind you we are 22/23 we don’t have a lot of money saved up we are both college students and we are about to move to the most expensive city in the US. People around us are saying just move get married later and I agree with that and she does too but to and extent her family wants a grand wedding and they aren’t helping us at all so we have to figure all that out or don’t leave our small little town and another year goes by and we get set back in school and life. 

fast forward 4 months I get into my program in New York and I have to leave in a week, I tell her and her family this I say we have to go you already go into yours I just got into mine we have 6,000 saved and we have a place to stay we can do this. She’s iffy and I understand it’s a big move but the way our relationship was it was so strong this was a no brainer. We hav remade so many sacrifices for each other in every way! 

I ask her is there anything you need to tell me on why you don’t want to go ? 
She says she’s been lying to me about a lot of things and she’s afraid it will be revealed when we move and she will
Be stuck if I leave her. I tell her we can work on these things I know you’ve been lying I’ve prepared for this moment. We go back and fourth and realize it’s over 3 years of every day together hard times and good times VERY hard times and it’s over. I pack my stuff and leave. 

I drive 22 hours to New York and I’m putting on that fake persona again I have brothers and sisters but they are much older and Caribbean they don’t really understand. 

I’ve been taught to not show emotion never let anyone see you weak , my dad sided a few months ago and I want to cry but I haven’t shed a tear I haven’t even cried about this as  bad as I want to. 

All this bottled up turns to anger I get so mad so quickly. I know I made the right choice but I’m so sad and down and I’m tired of being fake I want people to know 

I’m a mess bad things do happen to me and all this is a front I’m messed up. 

My problem is I do have a lot of knowledge and I give very sound advice so no one knows I’m down bad."
327,depression,I’m ready,"I’m ready

328,depression,missing my friends and feeling kinda down,"i’m on holiday with my family and i know it makes me sound ungrateful but i wish i could be at home with my friends. my family are strange and it’s difficult to describe how testing it is to be around them, especially nonstop for two weeks. it also means they’re constantly watching what i do and eat. there’s no privacy here. my family are constantly fighting and screaming, and when i open my phone i see all the parties i’m missing at home. i’m not doing much here except from sitting around in the heat a lot of the time and eating at overpriced restaurants. i don’t want to seem like a brat but the lack of routine and socialising is making me slip back into a bad mindset and i’m finding myself thinking terrible things because i’m miserable, stressed and pretty bored. i’m worried that things will go downhill again since i only recently started to feel better. i’m also anxious since no school means no structure or certainty, but i’m nervous about going back to school as it means facing the problems i left behind when we broke up for summer, as well as preparing for exams. hopefully things will be okay again when i go home."
329,depression,depressed,"i just feel bad, raw, vulnerable, and sad. i don’t know why apart from depression, there’s no way for me to cure this feeling. i am just trying to self care my way through it (food, shows, rest) but i feel so exhausted. i am so tired of feeling this way. all i want to do is sleep all the time. i feel so so bad):"
330,depression,Can I just die alrdy,Not suicidal but honestly sick of this shit
331,depression,just feel overwhelming alone,"today i have officially lost all my friends. my supposed “best friend” of seven, going on eight years has ditched me for a girl she’s known for maybe 6 months and moved in with recently. 
my other “friend” pretty much used me as an emotional support crutch till he got a girlfriend. he traumatized me last week, calling me, screaming into the phone saying he was alone and had a g*n to his head saying he was gonna do it and i was all he had. this put a lot of weight on me as i felt personally responsible for his well-being. 
he did this a day after my little sister and brother accidentally od’d, and my little sister was in the hospital for 3 days for serious issues following what happened, then got sent to a mental health institution for a week. i blamed myself for everything, as i should’ve seen the signs, etc. 
my boyfriend has been supportive to the best of his ability, but he has his moments. we live with his family, and they don’t bother to even talk to me or even ask about my siblings, or me for that matter. i really don’t care as i have no respect for them to begin with, but no one’s even asked me if i was ok this entire time, other than my boyfriend. 
i have mental health issues myself, and all of this has thrown me into a major depressive state which is dangerous as i’m bipolar 1. 
just needed to get this all out, because i feel broken and used. 
thank you."

336,depression,How can I smell less terrible?,"A bit of an embarrassing one. But I need help. I have had severe issues with depression for 2 years or so. I have become less strict in my formerly multi-faceted bathing routine (I loved showering before this), and often skip days at a time because I just can’t motivate. It has caused issues with my relationship, the value I put on myself, my confidence to go out. I always seem to smell sweaty in like a stressed way (not a nice after work out sweat, if that makes sense). I forget to put on antiperspirant or deodorant most days/nights. In my feminine area I never feel I smell right, and I am so self conscious of it. My bladder leaks occasionally a little bit post surgery I had 2 years ago, so I always feel horrified that I will smell like urine too. I developed a UTI from not bathing enough after sex, most likely, and I feel so ashamed and smelled even worse and felt even dirtier the whole time. 

How can I set up a new routine I can stick with to feel less wretched? Any advice for motivating myself to get in the shower? I want to be normal again. Sorry if this is completely gross, but I’m really sad and low about this. Thanks for any advice. 

FYI I have very long hair I try to wash every other day but when I neglect showers entirely it goes a little longer sometimes. I love soap and dislike body wash. My skin condition is fairly normal, not too dry."
337,depression,I shouldn't be alive,"My mother had a medical condition that her doctors said she'd never have children. I wish they were right. 

I don't want to deal with this bullshit life. Everyday tasks, and just existing is exhausting. I can't sleep regularly, ony a few hours a night. Some nights not at all. 

I think about dying (not necessarily suicide, but those thoughts happen too) nearly every waking hour. I just want to die. I don't want to exist. I shouldn't exist. 

By most people's standards, I have a fairly cushy life. I don't need a regular job (at the moment), and I spend most days rotting my brain on YouTube and playing minecraft for hours. But I also have to watch my parents get older and deteriorate. I need to do tasks that they're no longer capable of. I want to leave, but I can't abandon them. They need me. I want to die or I want them to die. I want all our suffering to end. None of us deserve this life."
338,depression,I don't want to do anything,"Nothing is motivating to me. I (27 genderfluid, mostly male) don't want to work towards goals. I don't want to do my hobbies. I don't ever want to get a job. I don't want to cook anything more elaborate than frozen pizza. I don't want to read comic books, or watch TV, or scroll through social media, or do literally anything. I don't even want to walk.

I felt this way earlier in the day, so I took a nap. And then I woke up and still felt this way.

I think I know what it is. I just hate the problem AND the solution:

Virtually everything I've ever done for my entire life, from my education to my food choices, has been doing what everyone else wants me to do instead of what I want to do. And now I'm just realizing how little I care about all the things I've done my entire life, and now I don't want to do anything.

If I can shift to what I care about, maybe I would actually want to do anything. But even that feels like that's just something everyone else wants me to do, instead of something I want to do. I don't want to become more authentic &amp; prioritize my core values. Everyone else just keeps telling me I should. And it requires a LOT of emotional labor, and I'm too exhausted to do that."
339,depression,not sure how much longer I can go on,"There's a whirlwind of emotions I've been going through these past couple of months. From severe anxiety to severe depression. No one would notice if I went missing and the only way they'd find out is because my job would probably contact someone to ask about why I'm not showing up. I live alone, no one reaches out and seemingly no one cares. My whole life has been full of one way relationships, it's always me who has to reach out even as a kid. I've taken the hint that I'm just not that great of a person as much as I try to be. Anxiety and depression has been kicking my ass lately and I'm pretty close to letting them win. I have no one and feel like no one. I have no confidence or hope for the future. Most days I feel like I'm doing everything for nothing. I honestly don't know what to do."

I’ve gone to therapy and it helped some but not much. I’ve tried medication but I had terrible side effects and honestly I’m afraid if I had access to medication I’d over use or attempted something. I was diagnosed with HSV1 when I was 17 and I’m now 31 and I still feel horrible. I’ve never gotten over the stigma or my life back. So much has happened in my life and I hate victimizing myself but some days it just feels like it’s never going to end. I just want to feel safe. I lose track of time,sleep, hygiene, and I can’t seem to remember things correctly any more. I feel like my life is thing big secret to everyone I love and I’m struggling alone and idk how to open up but I’m so tired of the internal screams and cycling thoughts."

344,depression,My life feels pointless,"Ever since i was in my teens i struggled with depression, severe social anxiety, and very socially awkward. All i wanted to be a normal guy with a decent talent that have a girlfriend or wife. I have absolutely no fucking talent at anything. I have been rejected, laughed at, taking advantage of for being nice and called names by girls i had a crush on in high school.

&amp;#x200B;

I was bullied and it still haunts me this day at 23 years old not standing up for myself so i didn't get expelled. I wish i didn't give a fuck about those rules and just said fuck those rules and cave the fucking bullies skull in. I regret not going to college, i regret being the dumbass that i am not getting my drivers lisense when i had the chance.

&amp;#x200B;

I regret not being braver to approach the girls i liked and not having the social skills to actually have a girl i liked to actually want me, and maybe i wouldn't be a 23 year old kissless, dateless virgin. I feel pornography plays a role in why i was so fucked up mentally in my teens ( i am trying to overcome porn and am on a streak of a week so far), but you know what FUCK porn! It ruined my life and robbed me of a good childhood. I curse the day my dumbass as a kid first laid eyes on it, and only if i knew the long term effects it would have. FUCK PORN!!

&amp;#x200B;

It is hard for me to get a job due to having no job experience and making the major mistake of taking a couple of gap years off but then this damn virus showed up out of nowhere and fucked everything up as soon as i was about to get a job.

&amp;#x200B;

2 years later, for 3 months straight i have been trying to get a job, and due to no transportation the job must be on a schedule that aligns with my parents job so i can get picked up but so far at every step of the way i have failed at actually aquiring a job. Everything is so damn hard for me and i fail at everything. I wouldn't wish my worst enemy to experience the soul crushing failures, and embarassments i have in my life. I know posting this won't change a damn thing, but fuck it.

My wife hasn’t taken great care of herself over the years. Until the last 10 years, I have.

This is my future: my wife will die, my mother will sink further into the Alzheimer’s abyss, and I’ll have a one bedroom, rat infested apartment, alone, watching my mother sit in the corner drooling not knowing who I am.

When she finally goes, I’m blowing my head off.

I've always been the friend that gets excluded and is nobody's first choice, I don't think anybody even likes me anymore my parents are always pissy with me and my friends seem to get aggravated when I things they don't like (which is hanging with them I guess.) I've been on several medications and none of them have worked, so now I lie and say they're working fine and that I don't need to take them anymore. I've been self harming for about 2 years now and I have no intent on stopping anytime soon. I hate living, I hate breathing and I hate being on this fucking earth.

 I'm a hight school student who is going into his Soft More year. I have no goals and life just seems pointless and this point in time. I get burn out from nearly everything I do. I feel nothing, for the past 3 years I have forgotten what it's like to feel happiness. Everything is a chore to me. The anxiety just pops up at any given time, ""im practically shaking as I write this"". I just keep on falling deeper into a hole of nothingness. My neck is sticking up from my grave. Everywhere I go I can't help but stare at the ground. I had plans in the past all failed because of the lack of motivation to do so. I don't want to talk anymore. When people talk to me I barely speak. All I have is my girlfriend. But I can't open up to here. I am useless. I'm so lazy I sit in the shower and say there for an hour at the least.

I've always had a hard time making and keeping friends but now I don't even bother to make an effort. In fact, I'm pretty sure I hate people now. I haven't been given many reasons to like most people even though I still try to be open minded but I don't bother telling people anything anymore or opening up. I know not everyone has to but I'm a very expressive person and for me, closing up is pretty much the death of me. I can't imagine continuing life like this, being alone and isolated all the time but not being able to stand other people. I don't know what else to do but hope I don't wake up the next day or that I won't have to live very long. I have gone to therapy but I don't like talking to therapists. Maybe I can try art therapy or some other form of expression."
355,depression,Wanted bad/negative things to happen deliberately,"Anyone with diagnosed depression thought of that? Well I cant share or explain any specific examples of negativity actually happening in our lives, it's illogical of thinking this way. I have done this quite a lot in my preteens and adolescence

I am an adult now but my mood disorder issue has re triggered due to an event

The closest example I can give you is wishing that those classmate who always are taunting come at me again, want to get rejected and have a life of misery where some random crush I had would be with someone else as I fail to become a good provider due to my sucky academics and working a shit job"

I Was Taken advantage of sexually at the ripe ole age of 7 by some family members. Then again By a grown man at 10 at a daycare. Then again by an nasty older woman (Maybe late 40’s) At 11 at a different daycare. My parents divorced when I was 8 months old- nothing good ever came out of it. Stepmom forced cheese down my throat when I didn’t want it until I puked then did it more-hate cheese now. My Biological Father made me eat his size portions throughout childhood leading to Weight problems (Some till this day). My mother was verbally abusive. I was bullied mercilessly from middle school until high school. As soon as my friends from elementary school found their place in (School Hierarchy) they all abandoned me. I am ugly and never had any long term relationships. Shared my story with girl with similar trauma. (She was raped by her own father twice). We had a very close relationship. She couldn’t take it anymore and killed herself right before high school. Always terrible luck with jobs. Circumstantial hell. Had 3 relationships since school ended. All of them cheated on me. Life is in shambles. I have purity issues now. Been talking to girl in interested in. She already has a kid. Don’t know if I’m good enough to be someone’s second choice.

If I go for a career shift it would take me months or years before I become good at it. I tried searching for scholarships abroad but there's an age limit. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of the interviews where I need to act jolly and excited to please people. Death isn't the worst thing that could happen to me right now to be honest.
362,depression,Everytime I think about her my day gets ruined and I just want to isolate from everyone.,"I had an ex of four years and everything was great in our first three years but then as we got into our fourth year upcoming on our fifth anniversary she became different. Once school started back in person she kind of changed, she got friends and hung around guys. Our relationship wasn’t the same anymore. She kept “making mistakes” when it came to some guys and through screen sharing on FaceTime I found out she was telling other guys she misses them, putting hearts in their names, sending them hearts but then would tell me “I’m sorry I never meant to hurt you” but I’d told her multiple times to cut off the guys that obviously had feelings for her but she would always say “it’s hard because I’m a social person I like to have friends” Truth be told I don’t know if she lost interest or was trying to keep me around as some emotional support while she did me wrong. After awhile between my friends talking sense into me and me coming to the realization she wasn’t going to change I finally ended things with her, she kept trying to talk to me wanting to be friends but I couldn’t do it. Everytime I look at her all I see is pain and regret. She finally got the message and we haven’t spoke since July 15. The last couple times we spoke she told me that she has breakdowns, doesn’t talk to anyone anymore, the guys she was messing around with don’t talk to her anymore because I’m guessing she isn’t fun to them anymore now that she’s depressed. To be honest I don’t feel sorry for her I don’t feel sorry for cheaters and should reap what they sow. I can’t go a day without thinking about her and all she’s done to me. I’m broken I’m not who I used to be, I don’t eat anymore, I stopped my hobbies, I don’t play video games anymore everything’s just boring to me now and all I do is go to work and if I’m not at work I just lay in my bed listening to music."
363,depression,This is kina my last hope,
364,depression,Everyday feels the same,"(24m) About 3 years ago I landed myself in the hospital because of my attempt. I was asleep for 2 days when I woke up I remember the faces of my family. I was with my then girlfriend at the time and when I got through the baker act it felt like I had to restart for everyone so that i don’t hurt them again with my stupid actions. This was the second time I was baker acted for an attempt. The first time I was in 10th grade. The first time I had a thought about ending it I was around 8yrs old and I woke my dad up from sleep with a butter knife in hand and told him I didn’t want to be here anymore. I have scars that I’ve given myself years ago, recently I’ve started to cover some up with tattoos, but the pain still is there. I’ve hated myself for so long.


Well around August of last year it was the worst year for me, mentally it’s been exhausting. I broke up with my girlfriend, too much toxicity from the things she used to do and would do(mental and physical trauma). I thought I was the issue every time we fought, but she had a twitter where she would talk shit about me and talk about how she liked other guys. It hurt me a lot it killed my trust but it was my fault for finding it and betraying her privacy.. that’s what she told me. It hurts. That’s not fair. I finally hit the switch and broke it off after finding a better job that’s a 9-5, got out of customer service which I really needed.

During the time I broke up with her and started the new job I was messing with a  girl that got out of a similar situation. We had worked together at my old job, and always flirted but never did anything because knew it wasn’t good  for my relationship. Well when it ended we hit it off great. I mean she got out of a toxic relationship too, I knew it was going to be a rebound situation but we both needed it. She was amazing, I never knew how it felt to be treated by someone who actually cares about you. She showed me her scars and I showed her mine. Well she eventually told me that I caught feelings and she didn’t want that so she removed me from her life completely. Last time I saw her we kissed and I always look at the same spot in my driveway when I come home from work and the memories rush back. She left and never spoke to her again, last thing was a snap I sent saying “take care of yourself if you ever need me I’m here”

It’s almost been a year and since that occurrence and I’ve been to the hospital 3 times. The last time I was there I split open my knuckle from punching a mirror. I hate myself, id never hurt a soul but I hurt myself. I may not be able to use my hand the same, and it’s like I don’t even care.. my family is torn I could go on so much about how. Everyday I think about that girl how she treated me how it felt. But I don’t want to feel the pain of someone who doesn’t really care? Like not saying she didn’t but heartbreak sucks. And I don’t want to be in a situation where I feel controlled like I have to please every part of who I’m with. And finally… I just don’t want to be alone. I wake up go to work go home play games work out and go back to sleep to repeat. But i cry everyday I think about all this shit everyday. The games and the books are just minor distractions, they don’t even seem to work all the time. I hate crying and Im afraid of dying but what’s worse? A repeated loop? I mean everyday just feels the fucking same and I honestly hate it. Sure I can change it by adding another hobby? I mean I go out with friends but it feels like there’s just something not there, I hate this. I guess I’m just finally realizing how insignificant I am in the massive world filled with people making more by doing less or striving for a future filled with gold so they continue to pick up the scraps in hopes for a miracle.  

Right now I’ve settled on the fact that I’ll never see her again, never hold or speak to her. I’ll continue to live my life waiting for an opportunity to make good money to just live without the stress of waking up for the same routined shitty 9-5. I know I won’t love again or have someone because I’m clearly not in a good place and I don’t want to feel that pain again. I’ll die alone I know I will. I love my friends and family but I can’t burden them forever. They’ve been so good to me and I know it’s selfish but I’ve been so selfless maybe it’s time to be selfish. 

I’m sorry for the ramblings. It sounds crazy when I reread, it’s 2:38am and I have to wake up for work at 7:30. I just can’t stop thinking about how my life is a loop now, I know there’s gotta be ways to get out but right now I’m stuck. And I don’t know if I can continue. It’s been a hard life so far and this year just really blew up on me. I wish I could just leave this planet and look down to see how small everything really is compared to the spaces outside of our perspective. Falling in reverse. Thanks for reading."
365,depression,Depression for me.,"Hello, my name is James and I suffer from depression. I have a hard time even talking about depression with people sometimes because they just tell me “oh it’s bullshit and it’s in your head”, nothing like that’s happened to me before.” Well that’s great for them. 

I could be having a great day, it could be Friday, we got paid, we don’t work tomorrow. 
All circumstances are good. Nothing to really complain about. Yet sometimes I’ll just have this feeling and I know it’s coming. 

Could be having an excellent day and out of nowhere  I can feel this feeling coming over me. I can tell when this feeling is coming and I’ll say to myself in my head, James, all is good, nothing is wrong, why are you feeling like this. Honestly I don’t know. I think to myself in my head as I’m starting to feel this and say “what’s going on? What got you here? Everything is going good right now what’s making me feel this. I think this as the feeling is coming on. 

I attempt to use logic thinking and figure out what has brought this on. I can’t. Nothing bad has happened am I’m thinking to myself what is making me feel this way out of nowhere. 
I don’t have a reason for myself. Talking to my friends about it they just think I’m crazy. Well from there point of view I’m just getting depressed out of nowhere and it prob sounds crazy to them. Well I’m not an unreasonable person and I can clearly see what I’m saying and how it just sounds silly to them. It sounds silly to me.  

If I can’t understand why it’s happing myself how do you explain it to other people. I just sound ridiculous.  

I’ve had some friends say oh well I got depressed when my grandmother died. 
I understand that and I get it. When I say I can get depressed out of nowhere for no reason they just say it’s just in your head man. 

I’m not saying they don’t feel depressed when a loved ones dies but when I say it can come out of nowhere for me out of the blue, they just look at me like I’m crazy. Me not being able to explain it myself, I get them saying I’m just nuts. Hard for them to understand it when they don’t experience it like that especially when I have a hard time understanding it myself.  

I just don’t know why this comes over me when things in my life appear to be good.  

Crazy enough I can literally feel it coming on, I know this sounds crazy and off the wall. So yeah I can see why this might be hard to believe for someone not experiencing it themselves. 

Anyone else out there experience it coming on out of nowhere?"
366,depression,I still get anxious from seeing a photo of my ex and I feel like I am an idiot,"My ex dumped me over 2 years ago. I have had a many of dating app matches and conversations, hook ups with guys and girls and others, and a couple of failed relationships. And no amount of hanging with friends, antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds, smoking weed, or anything can get rid of that feeling I feel when I even see a photo of her. It sneaks up on me and when I am unfortunate enough to see something related to her, my day is ruined and I just can’t think about anything other than how pathetic I feel. Its been over 2 fucking years and I still can barely bring myself to say her name. I wish I could wipe my memory of her existing. But I know deep down, I really wish she just didn’t give up on us. Which sucks cause I thought I’d be over it by now."
367,depression,Do I even exist in this life???!?,"It seems like I am so lonely or just always isolating myself from the world that I don’t even exist anymore or like I am forgetten from my family, friends or anyone I used to associate with. Does anyone even see this?! I’m so fucking hurt."
368,depression,"Does anyone get a growing resentment because you have urges to open up to certain people, but because how misunderstanding they are, makes you even more angry?",[removed]
369,depression,constructing a system to distract myself,I am kind of constructing a system/world/view by my interest in *Ancient Egypt*... but actually its all to distract myself...from my chronic indecision and stressful life. But I am feeling really stuck.
370,depression,loneliness will kill me,"Little rant sorry
Hello, weird thing to say but I want my depression to get worse and consume me till I can't take it. I've had the push through anything mentality for years,. I know one must suffer to find peace and happiness but suffering is my entire life. There's no one in my life, I can die in bed and not a tear would be shed for me. The life of working to pay bills and then come home to nothing is retarded. Years spent trying to make just 1 friend and nothing. Loneliness will be my killer not me. Why suffer for nothing, I get if you have kids or something that makes you want to get better but I got nothing. 
The one thing to save me would be having just ONE friend but my efforts to make on have failed. Just having someone would be enough to make me stay."
371,depression,I think kms is the best thing I could do for me rn,"So, rationally speaking and leaving all emotions aside. I have no emotional reason to end my life, by which I mean that it's not something I thought about on a whim, but why continue? 

I am turning into a bitter, lonely human being and I know how my life will be, I've known for some time now and if you're me, it's really not that hard to predict. 

I was not crying when I started writing this but I am now, not at the thought of ending my life but at the thought of living it like this. I am more terrified of continuing this grey, useless life than of death."
372,depression,How do I bounce back?,"Back in September/October I went through one of the worst battles of depression in my life. I was very close to attempting suicide for a second time. I gained almost 40lbs and I completely lost who I once was. This lasted till April of this year. I feel im slowly climbing out of the hole. Im maturing. Im growing. I’ve lost almost 30lbs and I kicked a bad pornography addiction. I am just over all making the climb out of the suicidal rut I was in. Yet there’s still a big chunk of me that’s missing. I recently got into a relationship with a wonderful woman but I just don’t have the confidence and…ability (for lack of a better word) like I did before. I find myself making far more mistakes, being more insecure, and being unable to preform as well as I used to in bed. Not only that but on an individual standpoint i just feel like im missing something of myself. Im sorry if this doesn’t make sense. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated as I am fearful I’ll slip back into that really bad place."
373,depression,In a new city &amp; some good things are happening but I can’t help but want to kms.,"Im sitting here in a new city , in my first apartment ever. I should be happy but I just want to end it all. Im not going to because I probably won’t do it correctly and I’ll end up with more ugly wrist scars or brain damage…. But I’m just thinking about it. 


Why can’t I just be happy? Why am I so miserable?… I think it’s because I’m just so trusting of people and keep getting fucked over. I’m an idiot who loves everyone and I need to stop…. Idk….. I just think life here isn’t for people like me. 

I spent like an hour reading posts on the sanctioned suicid3 site…. But like I just don’t have the courage to end it. Maybe bc part of me is Optimistic shit will get better?…. But at the end of the day… what is the point of all of this?…. We are all going to die alone anyways."
374,depression,Invisibly Empty,"I’ve never posted to Reddit, I never post anywhere but at this point I don’t know where else to go. 32/m diagnosed with major depression since 16 and adhd since around 18. 

I did therapy in my teens and have finally made decision to give it another shot, but needed to put something in writing. 

I’ve denied to myself and my loved ones how numb I’ve become. I’ve always been easily sucked into the dark side of my mind, I think it’s become a familiar comfort to fall into despair. I’m afraid most that the cycle of depression and anxiety has become inseparable from my self identity. I’m not sure if I know who I am without that part of myself.

The rest of the world sees me as a quiet guy who’s happily married to a phenomenal wife, two beautiful kids aged 1 &amp; 4, financially doing great, killing it at work, great parents, great friends…. Reading this sub I feel guilty even posting here knowing the blessings I have.

All I see in the mirror each day is a workaholic and neglectful husband, absentee dad, forgetful friend and family member, and overall selfish person. Somehow I also turn that self criticism into being a victim which does not help the negative way I view myself.

My daughter at 7 months old recently went through an aggressive brain infection that landed her in the hospital for a month. She could’ve died, it was the most terrifying thing I’ve ever experienced. I must’ve made a hundred deals with god trying to trade my life for hers. She’s home and healthy which is literally a miracle I’ll never understand. 

all of a sudden I went from sleeping nights at the hospital, drive home and  work 15 hours a day, breaking down every minute I was alone in fear, hiding that from my son and family, 7 days a week for a month. Then one day she comes home and the world goes back to normal.

I’ve never felt so alone, helpless, desperate. Then, it was over and people talk about it when it comes up like it was a bad bout of flu. I was already at my breaking point mentally and emotionally but I will never forget the feeling of isolation while she was going through that.

I feel like all I want to do all the time is vent to someone, but feel no one actually cares. When someone does, I only feel guilty for burdening them and regret it after. Those I do lean on either have betrayed my confidence or seem uninterested. I work more hours than I thought possible to provide for my family, yet feel like I’m never enough for either.

All day every day I feel fake. I just don’t know how much longer I can pretend. I’ve been through my fair share of shit in life, but also realize it’s nothing compared to most and I am grateful for what I have yet feel I don’t deserve it. Lately I just feel like I’ve run out of people that actually care to hear about my life let alone ask how I’m doing.

I feel isolated, I’m doing the things I always had on the priority list for life, but with each achievement just feel more and more alone. I feel the last 15 years has been a slow spiral and no one really sees how close I am to falling off the edge at any given time. 

I should be happy but I’m not and don’t V even know what that means anymore. I don’t know how much longer I can keep up the act, but also don’t have a choice but to deal with it. i feel like I’ve been on the brink of a mental breakdown for over a decade, but my kids and wife gave me a reason to suffer through what previously were more dangerous thoughts. I can accept that and won’t give up like that even if only for them.

 I just wish i could remember the feeling when I was younger and thought those around me actually gave a shit about how I was doing. I get how that sounds, but can’t shake the feelings that I know it’s truth.

I used to be full of hope, optimism, idealism, passion…now I just feel empty. A machine only as good as it’s productivity who’s random cries for help are tolerated until it breaks once and for all and no longer is useful. 

I’m always tired. Always feel out of place. Always on a different wavelength. Always just a bit off. Always inadequate. Always feel separate, unsure, insecure. I’m just exhausted and feel out of places to turn. 

If you read this, thanks for listening to me ramble. This sub has helped me realize I’m maybe not as alone as I thought, hopefully my thoughts can do the same for someone else."
375,depression,Ever thought about killing yourself... no I mean,I have thought of this everyday of my life for the last 5 years I'm 21 now and  have literally seemed to have hit rock bottom I have been fighting it so long but the last two weeks it seems everything in me has drained out and I will be sitting in my car on my break from my shit job at 3am and I'll just start getting bombarded with all these thoughts of how I should do it and have lost that feeling when your thinking of taking your life that gravitates you away. I don't think this life is worth it anymore the pain the stress and the thoughts in my head will be the end of me. Just needed somewhere to say this.....
376,depression,my wife divorced me and my dog who I loved dearly died and life feels pointless now.,I want to lock myself away and just sleep until I'm dead.

378,depression,any tips for not feeling so empty and negative even though i have a lot going for me?,"
i am 16 and im diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i have a ton of stuff going for me in that i have super supportive (although not always understanding) parents and a good therapist and mentor. i have a couple friendships but usually they never seem to last more than a couple months and if they do then it just makes me bored bc theres only so much you can talk about before it starts feeling forced. it makes me seem like a bad person but thats just how it is. ive been hospitalized 4? times and none of them really helped. i always go back to how i am feeling now. empty and suicidal. music soothes and comforts me but it cant help me overcome extremely negative thinking. school is coming up and idk if ill be able to handle it. i dont want any cliché bs that ive heard before either. i want something that can actually help me feel a bit fulfilled. also u ask me anything if u need/want more info."
379,depression,I’m addicted to sexting and can’t stop,"Just typing this makes me feel like a manwhore. I spend a lot of time on the cumtributes and TributeMe subs, sending cock and cum tributes to women who ask for them. I really enjoy doing it but the problem is that I can’t stop at all. I wake up at 3AM to see if there is any woman online looking for a cumtribute. I’m a slut who needs to cum on women’s pictures and show it to them. I need validation that way. When I saw that they enter the chat but they don’t reply I worry about if they might find that my cock is too small or I don’t cum enough. I always have to ask them if they like it or not. How do I get a grip of myself?"
380,depression,Today was my birthday,[removed]
381,depression,I don’t know if I have depression and Idk how to seek help,"I’m 18F, and I think I have depression. I have never sought out professional help bc my family would shame me for it bc mental health is extremely stigmatized in my community. In high school I never planned on going to college bc I didn’t want to live past 18. Then by some miracle, I got accepted into this program at my state university. Seeing how proud my parents were, that gave me a reason to stay. Now I recently got a job related to this major and a sense of doubt is settling in. I feel like the initial joy/pride, whatever you want to call it, died after my first year of college and now all I can feel is anxiety, panic and dread for the future. So what if I got the job? So what if I will graduate? So what if I find success in my career? I don’t want to do anything. The only thing that truly gives me comfort is sleep and video games, if I’m being honest. And nowadays, sleep is the only thing I can do. I don’t want to work, to get married, to have children, to be an adult, to do anything. I don’t want to go out either. I used to love the idea of traveling the world, but now idec for that anymore. Now I just want to hide from the world. 

Before anyone comes for me, I hate that I’m this way. I want my doctor to give me meds, something, anything, to change and rewire my brain and make me happy. I have no money for therapy and I don’t want my parents to find out either. Sometimes I wish I could just go peacefully in my sleep but that’s too much to wish for I guess."
382,depression,sad,I think it’s better for them to not know everything. Like if my mood is down and they want to know *why* just to go back to whatever they’re doing I won’t give them any answer. I’m just going to keep a couple of things to myself. I don’t have anyone else so it’s best for me to come on here and vent. I’m just better off alone…
383,depression,I'm so selfish,"Currently in my life I have it all that sould make me happy. I have a fiancé, a son, a house and a decent job. Unfortunately, I've left myself unmedicated for the longest time and as a guy i dont have much people I'd turn to. The two years of lockdown probably brought me to this as i worked long hours all from home with government restrictions on what businesses could open or not. On Friday I tried to take my own life after weeks of putting it off. 

I'm currently in an inpatient facility and I feel even worse now. What a selfish cunt I am for even thinking all of this and to even attebpy to go through with it. I'm not better, but on reflection I'd never want to hurt my family. Why am I like this? How did I let it get this far?

Anyway, I'm saying this here as I don't want to address the 'why' with my family yet on this topic. They know I'm here currently and even visit, but I'm so ashamed that they're so supportive to a piece of shit like me."
384,depression,hardest part,"I think the hardest part of my depression is after all these years , is when you can feel it creeping back in after you've been doing so well for months, and actually was feeling kinda happy. But now I feel myself falling back into the dark place and I hate it"
385,depression,I don’t know what to do anymore,I’m still pretty young I’ll be 16 in September. I feel so lonely half the time. I have bipolar depression. I’m not in the best shape but I’m not super fat. I just don’t have self confidence or hope for the future. I’m not as suicidal as I was but I still think about it. I just moved so I don’t have access to in person contact with my friends. All I’ve done is drink and smoke to keep myself occupied so I don’t start having those thoughts. I just want a girlfriend or friend in general who actually cares about me and wants to hear about my day. I feel like I am the odd one out with my family. My brother doesn’t speak to me my sister is in collage and my mother switches from fine to angry in an instant. My father is a former army soldier who is now strung out and going to jail for a hit and run. Life is just hard. Nothing keeps me happy. I just need some guidance since I haven’t been able to talk to my therapist who is going through chemotherapy
386,depression,weird feeling,"i feel okay with my looks but then i wanna just mutilate my face.. even if its okay. like… i feel pretty yet ugly at the same time????? and either way just makes me wanna tear my face off idk

like this is on my mind all the time and its been an extra big problem recently and i sometimes just start to freeze up and the urge overwhelms me, thankfully havent done anything yet lol"
387,depression,I have this feeling that I just wanna be dead.,"I read this quote by Murakami which said “Everyone, deep in their hearts, is waiting for the end of the world to come.”

I cannot see a better way to describe this feeling. I don't wanna kill myself really but I do feel like hurting myself sometimes. I've never done it but I think I've come pretty close at times. I just wanna disappear for a while I guess... or for eternity. Or maybe I don't wanna die but I just wanna be dead."
388,depression,Need help,"I was diagnosed with depression few years ago. I was on medication for a year until the doctor stopped it as he thought I didn't need it. When college started after pandemic, I started feeling anxious all the time so I consulted psychiatrists. When that didn't work I went to the psychologist I saw before. She told me to try few things. They worked and now I don't feel anxious. But I am not still happy. And it's all my fault. It seems like I don't want to be better. I talk to others, I go to doctors but I don't work on getting better. I don't know what to do. I see no future for myself. I'm not suicidal but for now living seems pointless. I want to want to get better but it's been this way for years."
389,depression,Wife says she is depressed because of me,"So in addition to having anxiety and depression so bad that every day I wish a meteor would land on me, and the fact that the one parent I have left is about to die, my wife admitted that at least part of the reason she is so depressed is because of me.  Apparently I am such a loser that it makes her unhappy.  It makes me want to tell her to go on ahead and GTFO then but we have two young kids.  I feel like she should go ahead and stand over on the side of all the other people who told me that I was nothing, and a loser.  I probably am not making much sense right now but I am in a very difficult place right now and this was a kick in the nuts.  I am pissed."
390,depression,I feel like I live for everyone else,"I've suffered from depression for my entire life, I'm on the autism spectrum and need help with the most basic of tasks. 
I constantly feel like I have to live for everyone else and get no fulfilment out of anything that interests me.

I've tried so many different medications, therapies, psychologists, changes in diet, exercise, the works but no matter what I feel like I am not going anywhere. 

I feel alone in the world even if I do have loving friends, I have a terrible fear of losing them, like I bother them just by being around them.
I forget everyone has a life and doesn't have time to talk 24/7 but it really feels like the world is ending when one of my peers lives their life when I struggle to do that myself.

I think about death mostly every day, I couldn't ever take my own life however if I was to die I wouldn't fight it.
I just don't like living and I don't like the responsibility of being an adult, I imagine nobody does but the world is so overwhelming and I'm scared of it.

Sorry if this is all inappropriate, I need to get it off my chest."

393,depression,been offered a Project Manager role for a new firm but,"I just can't bring myself to take it. The pay is very good with a company car but my anxiety, depression and brain fog is just stopping me from taking it. In my current state I know I wouldn't last more then 3 months.

I have zero PM skills and I come from a mechanical engineering background (working in aviation) which I hate and stuck with for 9 years until I started having panic attacks in the work toilets 2-3 times a day due to mistakes I kept making constantly. I left this job 6 months ago still unemployed but have had job acceptance for low end engineering roles but my mind has a breakdown everytime I land one and I never accept.

I feel like I hate engineering that much that I just can't stand working in the field as I know I'll creep into a darker place with my depression and anxiety.

I have had time to reflect on what I would like to do and that is IT but trying to land a entry level role with zero experience is non-existent.

Anybody that's switched careers into IT give a little help? I'm thinking I should find a temp job in anything to pay my mortgage whilst doing countless amounts of online courses and boot camps. I just want to do something I enjoy instead of being false around people that are nothing like me talking about their modded shitbox cars all-day.

Sorry about the length but just needed to get it off my chest before I blow..."

I care about him but I just don't wanna look at him anymore after the amount of jealousy he has he got mad at me for being to close to my female friend bc we don't the whole fake gay thing just like guys (he does it with his friends too) 

Back in march I was SA'ed and all he did was break up with me and i couldn't even look at myself in the mirror I feel so gross and he said he'd take me back after 3 days of fighting he didn't even mention the guys name once it was all me 

Anytime i tried to leave he threatens suicide and drags fights out for up to 4 hrs over a simple outfit accusing me of wanting another man's attention he hates when I hang out with friends with out him 

Once when I didn't respond to him for 3 hours he blew up at Me and said I ruined his night when he ruined mine bc that night was the first time jn months I didn't see me mom over 9+ months with out a women I an very close to 

He tells me I'm a shit girlfriend and once went on a rant for 15 minutes on how great his ex was and all I could do was apologize everyone says I should leave even his best friend I don't even say I have a boyfriend most of the time anymore 

I'm falling in love with another person and I'm to scared to to leave...

Am I the asshole"
395,depression,Parents,"So, I recently told my parents about my depression, after a good or so year, hoping that they could help me or give me advice. Instead, they proceeded in telling me that I don't have any reason to be depressed, and how other people were much more unfortunate. 

Wow. Who knew parents could be this supportive?"
396,depression,I thought I was okay,"Lately, shit have been happening again in my life, around 4 years ago, when I was in uni, shit had happened. I was accused of cheating and had been ignored by the whole class for it. 
I was accused falsely with no proof or whatnot juat because I ranked suddenly in 2nd in my course. They started accusing me of cheating just because a few of my friends did that. Long story short, I fell into depression further especially at that time my parents separation was still fresh. 

Now, shit is happening again at work because of two envious people. They again accused me for something related to work, which I haven't even done. Honestly, I have been through a lot these past few days, I am trying my best at work but couldn't do it cause every move I do, I am constantly judged and envied.

I worked hard honestly without complaint; whenever I made mistakes I listen and comprehend then do my best at work. 

Now, I again reached another point in my life that I want to commit suicide because of this trigger I have become even more sensitive to people around me and has likely felt irritation for the past few months. I don't really advices right now, but maybe an ear to listen to me or comfort me somewhat regarding my suicidal tendencies. 

I have reached phases in my life where suicide is the only option and it never ends good, I always got scars in my body and have attempted hanging myself a few times, fate seems to get in th way though. I just really want to die and get this over with. I am hurting, they are hurting me even more. I just want to be alone and just die peacefully."

400,depression,Drug usage and ability to learn,"Hi, all. Thank you for reading.

I've been wondering for quite a while about how my previous drug usage has affected my ability to retain information. I feel as if my cognition, overall, has severely suffered due to unmonitored usage of some drugs a few years ago. I have not used drugs in quite a while and I am probably getting better with my mental health, however, I am still deeply concerned about the longevity of my mind and my ability to use it to its full potential. 

Has anybody ever fully recovered from gnarly stupidity? How long did it take? What were the signs of it getting better?"
401,depression,I really need help (tw: sexual abuse?),So today I was basically groomed if that is the right word for it. Sent nudes to someone who then tried to blackmail me. I'm (m16) so its videos of a child and they are threatening to send it to people. It is not anyone I know and is based around a Facebook account of the same name as me. I feel like shit right now and don't know what to do. It was on snapchat so I don't have the evidence and I blocked the person but im still really scared and don't know what to do.

In 2018 I was extremely close to taking my own life, but ultimately didn’t because I couldn’t leave my mom with that pain or my best friends in the navy… since then it’s come out to some of my friends and most importantly my significant other but they’ve all been super understanding. I journal sometimes my darkest thoughts on my phone b/c it feels good to get it out and somewhere that isn’t my head, long story short, my s/o found this (not sneakily, she stumbled upon this) and was very concerned (as she should be, these are my darkest thoughts) but didn’t understand this concept of journaling so now I’m very self conscious of writing things down out of fear of her finding them because she couldn’t handle them, I feel unseen (she cried way more then me) and uncomfortable writing down these thoughts to get them out.

I go the whole day putting on a fake smile and at times it’s real but the second that I’m alone I just want to cry. I just want to be happy but I’m so scared to tell people how I truly feel.

the one time i felt so genuinely happy was when i felt love. or what i thought it was. 2017 was a terrible year. i got in the wrong uber &amp; was kidnapped, human trafficked over 11 days &amp; somehow survived….only to find out no one reported me missing. except my now ex. who i was so in love with. still. who was cheating on me while i was away having doctors who couldn’t for a second comprehend what those 11 days were like. i finally came home. he’s enhanced &amp; expecting twins. 

my one reason i had that made me want to live … was never mine in the first place. 

i hate myself. but i love him. &amp; i loved me because i thought he loved me. so i thought there must’ve been something to love. 

clearly there wasn’t. 


i just found out my liver is in end stage failure. multiple questionable lumps in concerning places. &amp; supposed to begin chemo next month but cannot even afford to feed myself. 

i’m so scared to lose my dogs. they are the only heart i have. 

doctors tell me i can’t work. but have no answers for how to survive. 


i’m so empty. i have nothing left. 




thank you for this group. i am  sorry if anything that i said was not allowed. 


i don’t have anyone to call. 


how do you start to accept death at 30 years old? 

my birthday is in less than 2 weeks. i hate this time of year. 




i used to fight wild fires &amp; jump from helicopters &amp; stay on the line for 21 days at least. i can’t even get out of bed now. i can’t even buy myself basic human needs. 


i’m losing the will. 






thank you for this group. i’m sorry if that’s all over the place.

She calls me over next door at night, she was drunk, we talked and made out. Next day she says it never happened. I guess a mistake. Days later i helped her put up shelves and she said lets watch a movie after. I was done and she goes upstairs to put eyeliner on. Now we had talks about friends with benefits she says no I’m good girl and don’t do that. She gives me these flirting signals during this! Now my head is messed up. I feel more down than ever.

I have never told anyone for 15 years, no one in my family knows. And even if they did, they turned a blind eye. For me to suffer alone, I need advice I want to tell my little sister. I need someone to save me from myself. I fear I will do something to myself sooner rather then later."
413,depression,A win,"Holy shit. I needed this win so badly, literally. The Colorado avalanche just won the Stanley cup and I have needed a win for months now. I feel happy, it'd a dulled happy, but it's something holy shit. I've been a fan for 22 years now and it's feels good being able to focus on something and not how shitty I've made my life. For anyone that thinks Sports doesn't matter  you're wrong. Fuck this means so much to me. I'm really hoping this can put me in a good mood and I can get things done. I held onto to see them win another cup. Hoping to be able to see a couple more."
414,depression,Think i'm ready to admit that maybe I do have depression,"I tried to run and hide from this but I realised that maybe I do have depression. Some days, I don't make it out of bed. I have a very poor diet either because I have failed to make it out of bed or because i'm so deprived of energy, I can't be bothered to cook. My room was so messy for months that I couldn't even see my bedroom floor. I don't leave my house much because, well I rarely have any clean clothes because I don't do laundry often because either (again) I failed to make it out of bed or I have no energy to. I let my personal hygiene decline and i'm always unkept. 

My day usually consists of waking up, sometimes not making it out of bed, and then falling back asleep with this mentality that i'll try make it out of bed tomorrow. If I do make it out of bed, I try not to, but I usually end up sitting in the kitchen all day just on my phone looking for something interesting but nothing excites me. 

Up until now, I have never labelled it as depression. My family and friends think depression is a joke and despise people who have it. That's why I fake being happy but recently people are starting to see through it. Initially I was scared of people finding out something is up with me, but at this stage I don't even care anymore. I know they are just trying to help but I can't stop myself from telling them to F off, which only adds to my negative feelings.

Thanks for reading, I'm only posting on here as i'd never reveal this to anyone in real life. Idk if it's because of shame or embarrassment, but something is holding me back every-time from telling people irl. But I think just admitting to myself that maybe I do have depression is a start"
415,depression,Tomorrow is my last day,"I've hit the end of my rope. I have nothing to live for and no reason to stay alive. No one likes me. Not friends or family. I've tried to contact both but they're all ignoring me so if I'm gone it's not like anyone will be hurt emotionally when I'm dead. I've got no possible future where I'm not broke and homeless living in my car. I'm only a little less than a month away from being evicted and losing the job I have now anyways and ive tried my hardest to get a new job but no one wants me and I've tried a lot of places. I think I've applied to over 200 places by now and I've been rejected from them all even the bare minimum ones like being a stocker at a grocery store or a cashier at a McDonald's. Even though I went to college everyone still knows to stay away from me. 

I know no one here probably cares as everyone has they're own issues and demons but I just wanted to say I'm gonna try to hang myself sometime tomorrow I think. I've lived in constant misery for nearly 15 years, constantly alone and consistently a failure even with therapy, medication etc to help me. Life won't improve ever improve so I may as well get to burning in hell a few years earlier than if I lived my life and died ""naturally"".

Again i know no one here gives a shit about me but I hope you all achieve some peace and happiness that I'd never get."
416,depression,Why am I not enough?,"It is killing me. Like I actually feel like I can't breathe. I give a hundred and ten percent at all the things I do. My job, my relationship. And today felt like I reached my breaking point. My boss goes off at me and a few others in some passive aggressive anger because he wants to not work so long on the day he has to do inventory. And he's been getting upset with me for wanting to leave when it's my time to be scheduled off. I lost my bonus to another employee a few months ago and the main reason stated was because she has kids I and I do not, with an agreement between a supervisor and the employee because she was transferred to our location. Which any protest by me was met with the response of 'well you get to keep your pay'. And my boyfriend has been talking non stop about cleaning the house and decluttering it when I have been doing my best to keep it maintained. He admits it him as well but when he brings it all up it just frustrates me cause I have been doing so much with cleaning and organizing. I've been doing a lot better with everything or so I thought. And every-time I get one step forward to feeling happy and okay again I get knocked back down to feeling like I'm nothing. I don't know why I  care so much. I wish I didn't. Today just felt like a breaking point. And I don't know how to keep wanting to try after everything honestly. I want to. But I still feel like I'll never be enough for anyone.

Lately I’ve been wanting to open up to my best friend I just don’t know how to start the conversation. She’s had a lot of good things that have been happening in her life.

425,depression,"My life finally looks great on paper, yet I’m still just kinda tired and don’t know what else to do","I’ve crawled my way out of hell and finally got basically everything I could ask for at this point in my life. I have a sweet, funny, cool, patient, and communicative boyfriend. During the school year, I have a job I love, live with my beautiful, smart, and loving best friends, and have somehow kept my lifelong 4.0. My family loves me. This summer, I got my dream internship at a company whose culture I actually like. I have dreams of going to grad school and one day teaching math and owning horses and having a family. I freely and frequently express my gratitude and love for my friends and family, and I’m diligent about my meds and therapy and self care. I’ve done everything I can to live the life I’ve always thought was unattainable, and recently it’s finally happened (not in every way, but it’s definitely better than I ever hoped for).

That all said, I’m still tired? I always kind of knew that my circumstances likely wouldn’t change my depression and that I’d just have to cope with it. I’ve made great progress with learning healthier ways to cope and until… 7pm tonight? was keeping a lid on everything fairly well. But suddenly it just hit me again, and despite all my hard work and a huge support system and working closely with my doctors and doing everything I can, I still end up depressed anyway :// except now I feel extra dumb because again, on paper my life is pretty close to perfect, and I was feeling so good about it for so long.

Idk what else to do. I don’t want to talk to my friends or family or bf about it because I’m determined to figure it out without worrying anyone or making them feel like I need to be babied or fixed. I refuse to go back down that codependent road and i want to prove to myself that I can do it. It’s just hard and I’m running out of ideas and I just needed to get this all out."

Just wish people would realize all I am is a burden on them and they should just leave me alone. My mom always says I love you and even when I know she means it I just don’t believe that anybody could love me. I’m an awful person and even people with good hearts love me, even when all I’ve done is being a weight on their shoulders. I wish someone would just hit me over and over again until I truly realize how awful of a person I am."

I’m pretty much alone here and do nothing but work, be on my phone, go on drives and play video games. On top of suffer ing from OCD and depression I have social anxiety, so it’s hard for me to just go out to clubs and meet people. I’ve tried apps but no luck. This is pretty much my life now and I’ve slowly loosing interest in the things I once’s enjoyed.

I am almost 30 and I don't have anything/anyone to live for. I have lost hope that I will ever be happy again. I am just trying to figure out if the struggle is worth it? Previously one small win used to give me hope to move forward but its been awhile since I had any kind of win in anything. This just makes me even more depressive.

Today I made the mistake of looking up old friends. It makes me feel bad in many different ways, but it's for the best that I just focus on my life. It's really messed up how far behind everyone else I am. REALLY far behind. People I grew up with have seem to have ten times the life experience.

My life has been on a razor's edge for as long as I can remember, but I do have somewhat modestly privileged existence in some ways, but if I measure it up to another person's life it's not quite as impressive as I make it out to be.

Throughout all of my failures, I haven't been to devestated by the things that I don't have. But it has been a difficult situation to be in a constant state of loss. It hurts, I get used to it, but then it happens again.

Often when I'm hoping for some relief from the bad feelings, I'm instead facing all the twisted irony that makes my life feel like eternal punishment. I've made it through so far, but I'm getting tired of it."

I'd always been high-functioning. Managed to maintain my work/school/life balance. I got on antidepressants and things seemed to get a little better. Then I got into a really toxic relationship in 2015. And the dam burst. Everything I'd been holding back just came barreling through. I was diagnosed with a slew of disorders, depression being one, of course. Of all of them, it's still the one I struggle with the most. I've been on almost every med out there. I've even done TMS. I've had good times, I've had bad times. And honestly, during the height of the pandemic, I was great. And then a breakup a year ago. My mom's health started going downhill and now I have to take care of her. And it all came crashing down. Bit by bit it crumbled away and my control over my life waned quickly. And so now, my job, which I was so good at, I've had to take a medical leave of absence from because I can't handle every day. I can barely get out of bed. Clean. Shower. Brush my teeth. I'm on a waiting list to get into a partial inpatient treatment program at the local psych hospital. I'm really hoping they can do something for me. I wanted to try Spravato but no one around here takes insurance for it. So I struggle to get through each day. I do my hardest not to sleep through each and every day.

I’m 16 I have a sister she’s pregnant, I have 2 other siblings they’re  6 and 4 , I’ve never tried to have a connection with them until recently and I’ve actually been feeling super better about life up until right now, the reason is because I told my mom my grandpa who’s from my dads side has been touching me weirdly and been overly touchy and I expressed that to her and she had said to tell him to stop if it made me uncomfortable but I didn’t say anything to him because I was scared or idk , anyways today he touched me again and I told my mom bc I just had enough that I was letting this happen, and she stormed to my dads house and called my grandpa a perv and called the cops on him and then my dad told me I over reacted and that I was just trying to start drama and he said a bunch of other hateful things but idk if speaking up was the wrong thing to do and now everyone hates me and I’m just done, I have no one, I have nothing , I am nothing , I’m never gonna be anything, idk I just feel so sad, there’s nothing keeping me here anymore but I feel like if I go I’ll just be giving everyone power over me like oh we bullied her and now she khs, plus if I go then that’s really it and I don’t even want to go I just don’t want to feel like this anymore"

446,depression,I think I’m gonna kill myself soon,I don’t know yet. I just can’t take it anymore.

I’ve had headaches for the last 3 weeks and I’ve stopped caring about my basic needs and everything.
447,depression,(Mental health update) I haven't been doing so good..,"It's been a while since I used this app but the last time I posted here I got some support and I'm hoping for the same this time. It's been 8 months since my last post which means I would have been a year clean from self harm this month. But things have been really stressful. A big move, bf losing his job, im losing hours, not having enough money etc etc. There's just been so much on my plate recently and I've tried to manage but today I couldn't stop myself. I feel so guilty and angry because it meant so much not having to rely on self harm. Before I tried to stay away from that it was almost like an addiction. I just don't want to start spiraling any further."
448,depression,i used to be hot,"such a stupid thing to complain about, but it hurts. ive really let myself go. i look somewhat the same but i’ve lost my spark. i’ve lost all confidence. i rarely leave my house. when i do sometimes strangers tell me i’m pretty. it always feels like a slap in the face. i don’t know what to do with that. “thanks, it’s literally the only thing i have going for me”. it let me get away with not having to actually be an interesting person. it’s so shallow. i got what i deserve."

450,depression,When Loneliness Hit,"Idk who has the time to read all this. But if you do, God bless you. I have been feeling depressed on and off for most part of my life. Growing up in a different country, I was bullied in school a lot and that lead to insecurities later in my life. I grew up without a father since I was 5. I grew up in a house with my uncles and my mom for most part of my childhood/early adolescence. Went to high school and was bullied even more. My mom met my American stepfather in 2008 online. In 2010, my mom moved to this country because she wanted a better future for the both of us. A year later I moved here with her. The whole step father experience was weird at first. I could tell my stepfather (Keith) wanted to help me become successful, but never felt the the son-father connection until years years later.  My brother was born in 2010. I always asked my mom for a little brother to play with. When my brother was born I was already 15, but I still loved him and do until this present day. Started high school as a freshman without knowing any English. Met some friends and made the soccer team. My dreams of playing professional were up high then. A year later, My sister was born. I was happy and confused at the same time. Finished my first semester of senior year and starting my second semester, Keith found a new job in another state. We moved to Wyoming and I graduated high school there. Made a few friends then went to university where I made a couple of good friends. My junior year, Keith was diagnosed with cancer. It was devastating news for my mom and siblings. It was then when Keith started showing love to me as a father-son. When I graduated university, I moved home to help mom. I took dad to treatments out of state and developed a strong bond between the both of us. For the first time, I loved Keith and called him dad. He fought hard. Last stages of his life, it was heartbreaking seeing him struggle. He was a good man. One day he had no hope, doctors told him he needs hospice. I watched him die in bed with mom. Unable to help him and feeling hopeless, I watched him drop a tear before he passed. I will never forget that moment. I had flashbacks of all our memories together, and regrets of not bonding with him earlier. For 2 years, and staying at my mom’s house I couldn’t find a job after my dad passed. A year go, one of my friends calls me saying he found a job for me at the company he’s was working at. We both looked for an apartment and moved in. He found a gf soon after we moved and our friendship started to vanish. He is now moving out to a new place and I am starting to look at 1 bed apartment for myself. I have been feeling so lonely and depressed lately. I am in a new state where I know nobody. My mom lives 3 hours away so I visit her every 2 weeks. I am very antisocial and unsecured. These are the reasons I have been feeling depressed about: -Lonely (0 friends)
- lack of motivation to take action and work for my future.
-No luck in meeting that special one. 

My dad always told me I have potential and I am smart, but I am too lazy… 
I don’t feel smart and feel hopeless about my future. Sometimes I get so depressed I wonder how the people I know would feel if I stopped existing. I know everyone wouldn’t care long term and will move on with their lives. I wish I had the opportunity to make friends, people to mentor me in my future. I am 27 and feel like I’ve hit the end of the Road. I spend my days alone at work, home and gym. Don’t know how to meet people. If you made it this far, I thank you for taking a minute of your time to read this hopeless note about my boring life."
451,depression,How hard do I have to try,I know this might sound stupid but in my life everything that is competitive I either hold my team back and we lose or if I play solo I lose literally in everything irl to video games no matter how hard I work no matter I try I just suck and it’s really starting to hurt in ways I just can’t deal with all I want is to be good
452,depression,I am a horrible person and I don’t know what to do,"I live in one of the wealthiest counties in the U.S., my parents are filthy rich, I have basically had everything handed to me on a silver platter. I could’ve gone to any damn high school or college I wanted, yet here I am, 21 years old, still living with my parents as I eat myself to death. I never put effort into anything during my childhood, I always treated other people like shit and used them for my needs. I gained a hundred pounds in high school so my parents had to pull me out. My parents basically had to pull some strings for me to graduate high school so I don’t even know where I’m at in terms of my education. I am now living with my parents and going to community college. I have nothing to show for. No accomplishments that made my parents proud. Nothing. I feel terrible. I just want to die."

454,depression,I'm so tired of being alone...,"Im a 26 years old man and I've struggled for my entire life dealing with anxiety and depression. I feel now like I have the coping skills to now deal with my problems but slowly over these last couple years ive struggled with the idea of being utterly alone. Not entirely in a physical sense more or less but solely emotionally. I've been shutting myself out to the ones I love for years and it's getting to the point now where my pride won't let me open up. My support system is more or less falling apart and it breaks my heart because I'm too prideful anymore to even bring it up. Also more and more over the years, venting about my problems doesn't give me any satisfaction or reassurance knowing that someone knows I'm going through something. Furthering the problem. There are a very few of those people that can relate in their own experiences with their life long mental illness but I feel like there's nothing I can express or explain about myself that makes me feel any better or understand myself anymore than I do and I feel it just furthers my problem in opening up and feeling alone. It's been hard to lower my guard and it's been effecting my drive to find a partner in life. I don't expect any reassurance from anyone, I've never posted really anything about myself on reddit, I've always been a lurker but I want this to be a step into trying to fix this flaw about myself. For the first time in my life I'm actually seeing a therapist soon and I'm excited and relieved to finally get professional guidance.  Thanks everyone ahead of time, I'm just so tired"

I can't even work part time. I know I should not care what others think but their stares hurt so bad. I hate that they pity me and I have no close friends whom I can express my feelings.

A week before the concert me and my best friend were talking about what time we were going to get there. And recently I have landed a job at a high school I'm 22 and its a great job. So I told my friend if I was going to drive him he can not drink while I'm driving and he said no problem. And while we are driving to the concert he cracks open a beer and start drinking it right in front of me. And I tell him right away how disappointed I am in him and he just laughs in my face and he keeps drinking. So we get to the concert he meets up with a girl he met up tinder I tell him I'm not driving her home and guess what...… I JUST GOT DONE DRIVING HER HOME!!!!!!! So I drive my friend to his car outside my apartment and the whole ride he is telling me how its not his fault and how I shouldn't be mad.

I’m 22 years old I’m not good at anything. I can’t cook right I can’t clean right I can’t even satisfy my husband in bed. My husband has autism and I love him so much and I really want to ask him for another child but I know he’ll just say no because of it.
My son doesn’t even like me he always stops crying when my husband holds him but when I do he just cried even louder. If I were gone there would be no interference, no more worries, just my husband and our son playing and laughing forever. I really see no downside to it."

475,depression,venting since I haven't done it in a while. (TW: MENTION OF NUD3S),"Recently I thought my life was getting better. I had begun to workout, eat better, got more motivation, and even found an SO. I thought everything was going fine, until my SO invited me into a group chat with his step sister. She called him by a different name than he introduced himself as (we met online and haven't met in person). Whenever we would video call, he never turned facecam on. I figured this was weird. Eventually, he left the group chat, so it was just me and his sister. I asked her if her name was what he told me. She said it was not, but they had a friend with the same name. This was extremely weird. I felt guilty about doubting him at first, but after this confirmation I began to wonder even more. I sent a video he had sent me that I thought was of him (since he claimed it was him), and asked if this was said friend. She said yes. I told her everything, how he was lying about his name, catfishing me, and lying in general. She told me that he has done this before and was actually talking to other women. She also told me that he ""flexed"" that he was only using me for pictures. I'm confused, hurt, and embarrassed. I asked his sister if he had any way to share these pictures to which she said he had little friends, and would likely just share them with her. I sent her more pictures of who the SO claimed to be, and she again confirmed it was the friend. I thought my life was finally getting back on track, but now everything just hurts. We've already broken up, and we are definitely not remaining friends. He's cheated, catfished, lied, and manipulated me. I didn't even realize it. I feel so stupid, even though it's been hours since this has happened. Looking at it now, it was so obvious that he was catfishing, I can't believe I fell for it. What's going to happen to my mental stability? Was I even becoming mentally stable? It felt nice to feel like I was wanted by someone. I think that's what helped me get back into a healthier lifestyle. However, I now know that I wasn't wanted for who I was, but for how my body is. I hate it."
476,depression,My ex was biker in a 1% MC. Also he was my Dom (in a D/s dynamic),"No, I won't be able to find anyone like him. He was everything over wanted. I had so much respect for him , I loved him, would have died for him :'( 

Until the day I got drunk and messed everything up. 

Inside of me I know he deserves better, and he is right about blocking me , I wasn't submissive enough for him and did something which in his club culture is unforgivable. So yes I theoretically understand these things. But how do I move on???

I don't think I can live without him. I would even settle for him to just be my friend. Just to unblock me. 

But he will never do that, because I'm unworthy of it. 

I can't fuking live like this :'("
477,depression,I hope I am able to finally die,"I am very tired as many of you are. I am one of those people who feel like every time I hit rock bottom, I fall deeper. No matter what. I lost the motivation to become a doctor. My career. All the hard hours I’ve put in. Not to mention I am currently employed in healthcare purely to further myself in this particular career path. Something that has caused uncontrollable anxiety. I am ashamed and unfortunately defeated. I am ashamed that I work in healthcare and often find it difficult to find the motivation to help myself. Maybe it’s because I hate myself; never learning to really like myself. Or maybe it’s because I had a hard time connecting with my first 2 therapist and our sessions often made me forget about my initial worry and make me fret over something they said instead. For example, I was very distraught when I sought therapy. My last resort because I knew I was dying. I could feel myself become more and more suicidal. I felt directionless yet I knew I needed to do something. I told them that I didn’t know what to talk about. Just started talking about how I felt in that moment. Overall not well. But strangely enough a lot of the session was silent, awkward, and eventually I asked should I talk about my past? I found myself facilitating more often when I was truly uncomfortable and one part of me didn’t want help. Just wanted more suffering. Because I’m not well equipped and sometimes making everyday suffering under the guise of self harm makes it almost appear like I’m in any sort of control. 

No recent event triggered my symptoms to worsen but rather the accumulation of the pressure to continue living life in addition to poor upbringing. It is a complicated story and dynamic as many relate to but I am currently spending 2 weeks with family. Small being 2 other people but demanding, toxic, painful people to be around and I’m only speaking for myself. I am not perfect. In my older age but being the youngest of the bunch I have been having a harder time disguising my displeasure, anxiety, and anger from them. Like it would be easier if I continued to cause no problem and enable their behavior and move on. I relocated away as soon as I could to put physical distance between us. If I can survive seeing them twice a year for holidays and seemingly for summers I can deal. But this has been one of the longest trips. One of the most irking. And I think I was in one poorest mental states compared to other times in my life. I think I will be dead before the end of the trip. Toxic family but too difficult to cut off. Not 100% bad people but I have tried speaking to them. Being honest. And being wildly misunderstood and punished. I much rather enable.  For my sake too unfortunately. I could see my many would see me to be in the wrong. I understand. Probably am. 
I’m ruining my relationship with my bf. Together 6 years. My mental is telling me he doesn’t care. I’ve seen neglect and mistreatment. He probably would better off without me. I love him so much but we have hurt each other too much. 
I am nothing. But what will it take to finally kill myself. I pray everyday I get the courage and get clouded with emotions. I want to die."
478,depression,The worst part of being depressed is just how alone you feel [lengthy rant incoming],"There is not a single person I think has ever truly understood the full extent of my depression. I've spent my whole life experiencing disappointment after disappointment, traumatic incident after traumatic incident, to the point where I wish I could ""win"" just once. Why can't a single positive experience ever happen to me? Seriously, it's as if I am being perpetually tormented by some sadistic deity. Any time something positive *does* happen, it gets tainted somehow. Here are some examples: A few months ago, I decided to leave the house for the first time in *years* and attend a concert... What happened? I not only end up throwing up right after the concert is over, (and publically humiliating myself in the process) but I also contract an awful case of Covid in the process. Boom! Experience tainted! A few years ago, there was a girl who I thought was into me, but she ended up being an emotionally abusive narcissist who lied to me constantly, talked behind my back, and used me as an emotional punching bag. Boom Experience tainted! THEN, not too long ago, I felt motivated enough to start brushing my teeth again. Except, that same day, I received news that that my mom had a heart attack. This killed any motivation I once had and I still haven't brushed my teeth ever since. Boom! Experience tainted! 

The thing is though, I have no-one to vent to about my frustrations. Everyone I've talked to has either called me ""lazy"" or ""dramatic"" or ""defeatist"" to some extent. I remember I was talking to a very close friend of mine one day and mentioned that I experienced a small emotional breakdown, (He said I can talk to him if anything was troubling me) and he immediately shut me down and tried to change the subject. Not even in a subtle way, just ""I don't want to hear any more of this."" It's not just my friends either, my family is the same way. I told my mom a few days ago about my rotten luck, which she then told my sister. Do you know what my sister said in response? She laughed and called me a ""weirdo"" She didn't even have the audacity to say it to my face, I had to eavesdrop. This is the same person who claimed she also experienced depression at one point. 

Why is it that wherever I go, I'm constantly met with platitudes? It's always my fault somehow. It's my fault that I'm depressed, it's my fault that I'm lonely, it's my fault that I can't cope with stress, my fault that I lack the motivation to do anything but sit around all day, it's always my goddamn fault no matter what. Do you know how much effort I put into simply existing? Why is that so difficult for people to understand? I just feel so alone and isolated, except I'm not allowed to express any of that without everyone making me feel like a piece of garbage. ""Other people have it worse! What do you have to complain about?"" 

I wish I could just... Well, you know."

481,depression,Wish that I manned up at an earlier age,"
I’m a 20M. My father was an alcoholic and my mother raised me on her own. He was a very weak man and it hurt to see him that way. Instead of using anger I became a doormat. My father was extremely athletic in his youth but did not pursue his talents after high-school. I believe this was part of what ate him alive and why he drank himself to death. I am also athletic and have baseball talent. But I got badly bullied at a late age and made a fuck ton of mistakes based on low self esteem. 

I dropped out of college and I’m finding that I genuinely have baseball talent. I can hit the shit out of the ball and I love the sport. I have these thoughts of me being on some baseball team and people from the past coming to harass me. I used to seriously be a push over and let people take advantage of me. I’ve always been handsome but I un-ironically didn’t see it. I took my father being absent very hard for some reason and completely rolled over. I was literally wearing makeup which is so out of character for me. So many people have a bad memory of me in that I was the receiver of abuse. 

I could have avoided being picked on had I just manned up and helped my mom. But I wanted the “perfect” life and ignored my reality. How to recover?"
482,depression,Life problems,I hurt and I been hurting for sometime. I been very secure about it. I know the reason I hurt is very cliche for any men. I been struggling to keep moving forward because the pain feels like it will last a lifetime and that I blame myself because I wasn’t strong enough to stop the hurt on time. I want to scream my lungs out sometimes but I just scream in silence but I feel my hurt roar. I am not suicidal. I am confuse on myself. I changed a lot and I did it for the wrong reason although at the time it felt like it was what I needed to become to see myself at my peak. But everything begin to crumble. I saw all of it and the most painful thing was that it was like it was slow moving on purpose so I wouldn’t miss anything and feel every bit of it. I talk to my dog and it helps but I am just talking to myself. I’m trying to be great I know what I want to become and what I want to mean. I want to be happy the right person but it’s hard to find someone that’s right. I’m not picky but it feels like I want someone to just be understanding and not push for so much change and when I ask for change as well to see actual proof. I am very tired of thinking of myself seeing something in the past. Like it calls to me and it manipulates me but I know it’s just me and it’s always been me. I’m stuck in a loop feeling countless things all at once and it’s because I put myself below to let someone heal before me. I can’t even begin to describe myself. I cried tonight for sometime I been holding that and it feels refreshing to have a dog to hear me out and be able to write this without denying that I feel like this. It’s okay I just want to grow and it’s been so long since I been alone. It’s something I need. I was told I could be too tough but that toughness was meant for me only it pushes me when I’m in situations like this and that’s why I write this big long paragraph that has very bad punctuation and grammar mistakes but this is me before I climb the big mountain. (Aka not a real mountain)
483,depression,Getting worse,i think i posted on here a few days ago but honestly my life is just getting worse. the depression is really getting to me and being bipolar is making it worse and worse. ill be great throughout the day and at night it just rings like a bell and its like i hate living. again i just hate everything about my self. i have no good features or qualities and im genuinely unlikeable. im not saying i will but im saying if i was dead i wouldnt see a problem

But it looks like my depression finally claimed my ability to speak. It's not that I don't want to talk, or that I have nothing to say, I desperately want to be able to say stuff, it's like a daily goal at this point. But the most I can get out is a few words before I just can't bring myself to talk for another few hours. 

I'm so worried it's going to affect my friendships, since all of them are used to me being really talkative. The weirdest thing is that nothing has really happened to make me worse or anything, just the usual depression I've had for years. I just can't talk anymore.

489,depression,When will this roller coaster of emotions come to an end…,"I don’t know what to do anymore. 20 years old here, unemployed and still dependent on my parents. This is truly embarrassing. I want to do big things, my mind is always picturing scenarios of me living my dreams, yet it’s like I can’t do anything about it. Im about to be one year on meds and well.. it has somewhat helped. For my depressive symptoms of course but not my anxiety symptoms. Currently on 40 mg of Prozac while taking 10 mg of Buspar to help anxiety… and tbh it doesn’t really feel like it’s helping. I literally spend my days in my house usually doing the same things. Everyday is literally a cycle. The times that I do go out with friends though, I always feel like I create such an awkward environment because I’m either too quiet or too anxious to do or say something. I love all my friends so much, I just don’t want them to see me different… it just hurts me knowing I cant be the type of person I was before this… I want to do so much, I want to get better, I want to find a job, I want to graduate college, I just want to be something. I honestly don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m going crazy, I feel like I’m losing myself, losing this battle… I don’t know anymore."

Don’t get me wrong there are aspects of life that make me feel glad that i am alive but at the same time there are so many others that don’t.

501,depression,How can I cope with the fact that no one loves me ?,"Burner account because people in my life see my Reddit..
In all seriousness.. I have no one. No family, no friends, nobody. Lately I’ve been thinking about it more. My family is broken, my coworkers laugh at me behind my back when I’ve tried to be friends/socialize (I’ve caught them) and every time I try to form a friendship/relationship with anyone it quickly goes south. I have no one in my life to go to when I’m happy or sad, no one cares. When I do open up about this feeling to anyone i know I only get generic responses like to get out more and find more hobbies or hang in there. Or I get “omg no what I care about u !!!” even though we both know it’s a lie because what else is someone supposed to say when I tell them No one loves me ? I’ve tried to tell myself that I don’t need anyone else to make life worth living but this thought it’s really been eating me up inside lately.. I feel like I’m just an unimportant background character in a movie. I don’t cross a single person’s mind, ever. it’s like I don’t exist. I have had this thought in the back of my head for a long time and I’ve managed to keep pushing my way through the same shitty life every day..  but lately I can’t get the thought to subside long enough to get through a day or even a simple human interaction. Please someone be real with me and just tell me how to cope with this fact instead of trying to convince me there is someone who loves me. Please"

503,depression,Physical signs of an episode,"Ok so I have diagnosed depression though my psych told me I was in remission the last time I saw him. I feel a legit sense of doom/ this indescribable feeling of death in my brain. I don’t even know if that makes sense but I felt it last night and it brought me back to being 19 and deeply depressed. It’s a fucked up feeling. My skin feels tight, my brain is buzzing with white noise, and my thoughts turn to fear/ suicidal ideation. I don’t want to die or kms. I also know that this disease is lifelong. Basically I don’t want to go back to how I used to feel and I’m terrified of that reality."
504,depression,"Is it normal to feel consistently mediocre in all aspects for an extended interval? Not just weeks, months. Years.","I'm wondering if it's just me or everyone I work around is just a lot better at hiding it. For the past 3 and a half years I've been waking up feeling like I don't even want to get out of bed (or off the couch nowadays). I go into work hoping to get off as early as possible only so I can have anxiety attacks wishing the day could end so I can repeat the same process the next day. It's like I can't get enjoyment of any aspect of what I do. 

My job isn't hard, I actually kinda like it, but lately I haven't liked doing anything I like, if that makes any sense. Anything other than eating and laying down is such a struggle. I go weeks in between personal projects, and months between playing games. Every  time my coworker asks if we could play a game I have to make up excuses on why I can't when in reality I can't even bare to play them by myself anyways. 

I under acheive in everything I do, even my art I find myself taking shortcuts when it's the one thing I should be putting my most effort into. At work I just do enough to get by, and not get complained to, even if I am dissapointed in my own work ethic, and just living in general. I don't know how to shake this feeling of mediocrity in all aspects of my life. I'm almost convinced that I am destined to work here for 20 years and die of diabetes or something."
505,depression,I hope this isn’t triggering to anyone but I HAVE to get this off my brain,"I’m in the bath right now trying to figure out why I am even on this earth, and the most stress:pain free way to leave it. 

I have felt this way for as long as I can remember (not knowing what my purpose is, wondering what is the point of my existence). And I know everyone says that, but I can honestly remember being 9 or 10 thinking these thoughts. 

I have always felt unloved. I’m from a single parent home and I have a half sibling. No I wasn’t abused or anything — but I have never felt loved. When I spoke, no one heard me (and I spoke allot, I am not shy or quiet by any means). But people tended to ignore me, or only care if I told them I felt like they didn’t care - and that attention was only temporary. I’ve always felt this deep sense of emptiness. I’ve grown into an expert at pretending things are okay and putting on a mask for everyone around me, but just below the surface of that facade, I’m broken and lost. I’ve tried telling people close to me (my mom, my husband) but they don’t take it seriously. My mom is more concerned with what my younger sibling is doing and what flavor of the month she’s complaining about for the millionth time, so she has no time or energy to worry or care what I’m going through. And I promise you, I am not a complainer (contrary to how this post may come off). I just want someone to give a shit. I’m not sure where I went wrong in the birth chart, or star alignment but I feel like I am just doomed. Yes I have a husband but he and I live separately because he too doesn’t have the capacity to hear me, or to understand me. I feel like all I do is give, and help and try to understand others and I feel like I am never given the same in return. 

But I feel like I’m digressing from my point. My point is I have tried to seek professional help. I have yet to find one I click with or one that doesn’t just tell
what they think I want to hear. Just like the people in my life. 

I’ve gotten to a point where I don’t want to have any friends, I don’t really go out and do anything after work because the stress of putting on this happy face beyond work is exceptionally exhausting. So now I just avoid things all together. I try to motivate myself to do something ie: workout, go for a bike ride/bike, a drive, anything outside the house. And I just can’t. And that seems to drive me further down the rabbit hole. I feel worthless, unworthy, ugly. So I honestly don’t see the point. No one would miss me. My mom has my sibling whom she has always shown that she cares way more about than me (ie paid for he entire college schooling and an off campus apartment/groceries allowance) meanwhile I had to pay rent to her at 16 and pay my way through everything. I used to think it was because she was biracial (whereas I am 100% AA) and therefore she was prettier than me and mattered more. But now I think it truly just has to do with me. Not sure why or how, because as I said before,  this divided treatment has been happening since I was 9. Maybe even before that with cousins and stuff. 

And my husband will be just fine. He’s got a child from his previous marriage and he’s truly a nice guy that probably should go back his church life. If he did he’d be perfectly fine and I would be an interesting story line for him in the blip of his lifeline. 

Anyhow, there’s a whole
Lot to unpack. But I just needed to vent. 

I just don’t see the need to live when all
I feel is pain that I have to hide for the sake of others. I’m glad I don’t have any vices other than taking too many baths."

I have a doctors appointment June 2nd with a doctor that I've seen for most of my life. I feel as though my current antidepressant medication isn't working anymore, I feel ""neutral"" about everything at best. I hear news of world issues and I'm largely apathetic. The med was doing it's job for longer than any other med I've tried, so I think maybe a stronger dose would help me more than transitioning towards another med considering I've tried various SSRI''s, Benzo's,  SNRI'S,

Im so tired of loving people. I want to be loved. I want someone's happiness to depend on me.

I want that power that everyone else seems to hold over me.

I fall in love too easily.

I want, for once, to be the one that is loved.

510,depression,"I've been depressed for a roughly 6 years, but my girlfriend breaking up with me is the worst pain I've ever felt","My(19m) girlfriend(18f) just broke up with me, and ahhh, I feel so fucking bad. We were romantically involved as far back as December 2020, and have been close since August 2019. 




We were in an LDR (I'm American, she's Australian), and both were in the late years of HS, and had a lot to bond on over time. Throughout the years we played so many different games together, had several 12+ hour long conversations, slept together on calls, and tried to make each other  feel as loved as possible



We had issues going back to December, and have had some rocky moments, but we've always been there for each other and the highs have so badly outweighed the lows. She's the best partner I've ever had by far. I love her so so so much. 



We dreamed of moving to the UK together, and I want that so fucking badly. I wanna buy her a home and build a life together, - and this is the strongest feeling I've ever had, about anything. I've been in other relationships, but I don't think I've ever been truly in love till I was with her 


But a little over a week ago she told me that she was considering breaking up with me, and it absolutely destroyed me. I cried everyday for roughly a week, and I've been so unproductive and unmotivated about everything. We broke up one day ago, and I am so fucking sad


I don't wanna date anyone else. Ever. I wanna date her, I love her so much, and I am so fucking crushed. I cherished every moment I had together, where it was being cute and flirty, or talking for ages, or sending cute little drawings and posts. But ahhh, it just doesn't feel like enough






I feel directionless.  The last thing I wanna do is guilt trip or come across codependent/manipulative or anything like that, so I'm not disclosing these feelings with her, but fuck I don't even wanna be alive, I just can't do this anymore. She was my hope and motivation, and it's gone"

It made me feel better in the moment, but I felt so guilty that she heard me say that I wanted to die, I didn’t even hear her open the door into the garage from the house (she wasn’t alone inside so don’t worry I don’t just leave my kid by herself, my mom and grandma were inside with her) it hurts me that I still want to die and it makes me want to die more knowing she knows about it.

I just want someone to care

521,depression,i feel worthless and stuck,"im going into my 3rd year of uni but i technically only have 7 college credits because i kept dropping all my classes midway through every quarter and wasting thousands of dollars due to constant unprecedented stress, being overwhelmed, not knowing what i really want to do with my life, etc. and now im panicking about how late i'll be graduating because my family's financial situation is exponentially going downhill right now and my parents are entirely relying on me to be the one to finish college ASAP so i can get a job and support the family's finances, but that in itself is stressing me out even more since i cant even get into the extremely competitive major i need, and every single class  i need to take is major-restricted but i keep getting denied from the major despite trying so hard so i can't even move forward with trying to graduate until i can manage to get in and my parents are constantly yelling at me and down talking me for taking so long in school and for not 'finishing in 4 years like all the other kids' and even though i know everyone goes at their own pace and such, it's still stressful and doesn't feel good getting constantly talked down on like that. 

im always being told i'm ungrateful, lazy, etc. even though i genuinely try my hardest to be a genuine and good person, to be realistic and driven about my academics and career, to do the best i can do for myself and my family, and i really do think i was raised very well but my parents seem to completely disagree and it hurts. my parents are asian so there's no room for understanding on mental health and they pretty much think i am just ungrateful and lazy and it is extremely difficult to be around them because all they ever do is talk down on me, yell at me, tell me im doing something wrong. 

and then i just get even more stressed out because i feel guilty for not being close to my family at all and i always daydream about how close we used to be and i feel like a terrible child for distancing myself so much to the point of barely being able to make small talk with them but when i try to be closer with them, they always just always have reasons to make me feel like shit with their words and it always feels like it's on purpose. there's never anything nice to say about me and im tired of it because i genuinely try my best.

i never raise my voice at them, i don't try to argue with them, i don't ever try to disagree with them. but for example one time my dad confronted me about dropping out of the pre-med path they pressured me to go into and when i tried to explain that my new major would make me much happier and that it was a very practical career choice, they only kept criticizing me to the point of me crying, and then they got extremely angry at me and yelled at me even more for crying and 'not talking to them like an adult'. that's how the majority of our conversations go, i am literally not allowed to show emotion or any sign of disagreement or else i'm yelled at for being disrespectful and immature.

besides all the family stuff, it feels like my entire life no matter where i am or what my circumstances are, it feels like i can never catch a break and everywhere in my life there are issues, stress, things i can't control and no matter how hard i try to take control of my life it just feels so out of reach and hopeless. i can't even go to therapy because i don't have insurance and i barely even have the money for rent, tuition, and food.

 im outcasted and talked down on at my job despite trying to hard to be extremely kind to everyone and perform my best (can't afford to quit since it's the highest paying job i've ever gotten and possibly could get as of now), i have years of eating disorder history that i'm still trying to heal from, i practically have no friends besides my boyfriend despite trying so hard to put myself out there so im pretty lonely. and speaking of, i feel so guilty because from all of this, i've been accidentally projecting all my stresses and depression and frustration out on my boyfriend which i absolutely hate myself for because he's such an angel and a literal golden retreiver of a man. before any suggestions are put out: i have hobbies, i'm not entirely friendless, i know how to be independent and enjoy my time alone, i can't afford to go to therapy, i just don't know what to do or how to process or handle all of this.

tl;dr - endless amount of massive and small stressors in my life and i just feel hopelessly stressed and worthless and i don't know what to do."
522,depression,Feeling like a bag of shit,"I am not a good person, I push and hurt people I care about. 

I have a sister that is 3 years older and she doesn’t have a perfect life but everyone loves her. Lately she has been doing really good I should be happy for her, but instead it makes me jealous. She can charm anyone and everyone loves her. 

I’ve been feeling quite depressed. So I have been making negative comments. I truly do hate living but don’t have the guts to end it. I hate to wallow in pity but that seems to be what I do. I know that I could change and help myself, yet I don’t. That’s why my ex broke up with me. He felt like he was hitting his head against the wall. 

Today is my birthday and all I did was cry. My little siblings texted me and said Happy Birthday. My sister that is three years older didn’t. I don’t blame her. 

She is probably done with me too. That’s fine if people feel like they need to cut me off so be it. They have to do what’s best for themselves. I wouldn’t want to be around me either. 

The level of empathy I have is gone. I just feel numb inside and angry, tired. 

Sometimes I want to slap myself to get it together. To get my shit together, to exercise, eat well and then my depression will get better. Yet I don’t have the Will to do so. 

I get so tired of living. I know people love me but I also know that you can love someone and not let them be in your life. I feel like a useless nobody. 

I want to change so badly yet I don’t. I hate myself yet I know I should have more sympathy toward myself. 

This shit is fucking hard. I feel so lonely. I just wish I could turn the switch and I could be better. Do better. 

This is just a rant."
523,depression,Feeling resentful and depressed over a demotion.,"I am switching from an employment agency to direct contract. The job I have is okay and not very stressful. But the pay sucks, for some reason the EA overestimated my job title and paid me $200 more than before.

I was free from depression for more than a year. I was ready to give my all and add value at work. But the recent announcement made me really really upset and depressed. How am I going to survive a $200 cut on a already low salary? 

There aren't many good prospects out there for an alternative job and I don't want to go through the experience of applying and being rejected over and over again. On the bright side, the job isn't toxic. I just feel I am not adequately compensated.

This cut was of no fault of my own, not the EA's, but perhaps HR's policy pegging wages based on education level and work experience. 

It is depressing. The thought hijacks my mind so often even if I try my best to escape from it."
524,depression,what the hell everyone is depressed even people with good lives,"Alot of  posts on people ready to off themselves, usually have pretty good lives. I mean alot of you guys have had relationships, good jobs, money, a good family or someone to at least be their for them. I am literally a fucking loser never had a girlfriend, dropped out of college have no social life. My parents which where a cause of me having such a shitty life, think I am being lazy piece of garbage for no having accomplished anything. Mom disappointed I don't have kids like its my fucking fault I cant get a GF. Literally no one in my life is cheering me on everyone just thinks I am trash and no this isn't me thinking it. I know for a fact they talk behind my back on how much of a loser I am. 

I used to believe if I had those missing ingredients in my life I wouldn't be so sad and depressing. Only to find out about people who have one or the other. Ready to pull the trigger damn life is a fucking joke. I used to want to kill myself, but now I realize how how stupid that is. I am tired of being sad because society programed me into thinking I need a girlfriend, money, friends, screw all that. 

I am just gonna be me from now on, no longer scared of what others think of me fuck the world. Ill figure out how to make myself happy even if it the stupidest shit ever. I recommend everyone else does the same."

533,depression,I need advice,I have really bad social anxiety and I’ve been depressed for half a year and I feel like I’m starting to go insane. I feel like a shell of myself and that my personality has just gone away because the only feeling I feel is sadness and anger and Im losing interest in a lot of things that I was passionate about and I can’t even enjoy hanging out with my friends anymore and I just feel like I’m going to die soon for some reason. I’m going on vacation in two months and I feel like I won’t even make it to that point because I’m going to commit suicide and suicide has been on my mind a lot the past week and idk what to do I’ve been to a counselor and a life coach and feel like that it has done nothing to help me out and each month I get worse and worse. I feel like I have to check into a mental hospital. What should I do?

535,depression,fucked up days,"These past few days i m having really fucked up days. I m having very hard time in medical university but you know what more hard is So called friends. They are giving me really hard time. I am an introvert quite type of person. I rarely speak but i always take care to be soft and gentle with others. I always faced hard times in making friends because people like talkative people entertaining ones.
Sometime i like to sit with people like me and say nothing and still feel relax rather then sitting in a group of people and constantly saying some shit which don't even make sense just to keep them entertaining so they don't leave me just because i m boring and introvert. People say friends are important in university to enjoy the campus life and i think i m not gonna enjoy these day.😓"
536,depression,I wish my life could change,"I’m currently writing this drunk off my ass. I’m 18 and non-binary. I just wish I could be happy with myself.

I have a successful job and an amazing love. But no matter how often I feel like I should be happy as a result of having what people would consider “successful,” I sometimes wish I could just die and not have to worry about living up to my ‘potential.’ I also feel like at any moment, everything will just slip away. As if my girlfriend will just dump me for being too lame and needy or that my employer will see me as useless.

I have emotionally abusive parents who make me feel like shit for wanting more out of life. Anytime they have a complaint, they drag it into a 10 minute discussion about how I am selfish or lazy. Today they were yelling and arguing with me because of a bar of soap. I know, it’s totally bizarre. All I could think to myself while they were yelling at me was “their worldview is myopic.” My dad threatened to throw me out. I told him “I’d just move in with [my grandparents]” and therefore it was useless to me even move forward with his idea. His powerlessness to control how I felt frustrated him. I’m pretty sure the only reason they don’t physically abuse me is because their too lazy. 

Sometime I wish I could die. I know it wouldn’t solve anything, but sometimes the thought is comforting. I just hate feeling this way. I can’t wait to move onto college and pursue something more intellectually stimulating. But god do I feel useless and powerless. One day I hope to be far from my worries. But I know tomorrow I’m going to wake up in the same shitty circumstances. Idk. Anyone have any advice?"

Don’t know if it’s because I went so long untreated mental illness or what but it’s falling apart. Can’t think much any more and can’t talk a full sentence. My mind is like at a red light and my emotions have went numb. No sadness or anger or anything. No frown, no tears or no smile. Im just blank and I’m scared. Im not sure of what I’m scared of exactly but I am. I don’t want to tell my parents because they’ll take me to the hospital and shove a bunch of medication down my throat. I would rather be depressed than have meds shoved down my throat against my will."

539,depression,Truly loved,I had a horrible time these past two weeks. I blew through all of my vacation time for the whole year and only seemed to argue with my significant other. I could break all that down but I'll save it for a therapist maybe. I just wanted someone to hear this besides myself and maybe it will make something feel real. I overdosed. I told my partner it was blow but I've been snorting meth for months. Please spare the comments. I know I shouldn't be doing that. After this I've committed to getting help. I'm tired of giving all my energy to someone that can't commit or match me. I don't feel loved. I want to be loved in the way I love them. I don't know if I'm asking too much or I'm being selfish. I did feel loved. I felt love like I haven't felt in years. The funny thing is it was when I was overdosing. The tears that fell on my face gave me warmth and something to hold on to as I struggled to breathe. I wish I got the same energy and compassion at other points In life. It's now almost a week later. I'm dealing with the after effects with missing work and my car broke down too. I asked my partner for help because the thoughts are back but they committed to playing Xbox with their sibling so I said I'd just be okay by myself. They just asked me to please not self harm. I just want to be loved. I want to be taken care of. I want to let it all go.

541,depression,High risk Jobs To Kill Me,"I kept grieving not being able to give years of my life to someone who wanted it. When I wasn't so sick, I dreamed of becoming a physician to help the thousands of homeless I saw suffering in Baltimore City. I no longer plan on living that long, nor do I have the passion or motivation to make it anymore. 

One night, while wandering Baltimore city at 1 am, stranded with a broken car, looking for a man to help me open my oil cap, I felt fear but I felt alive too. It felt powerful. I was almost fearless, approaching people, wanting help with my car but also hoping they'd end my life. The adrenaline was sick. 

I changed my direction in life. I want to enter a high-risk field, one where I could be shot or killed. We need people to enter these fields, and I want to help people. I'd be happy to use my mental state to help people, all while living an adrenaline-filled shortened life with a purpose.

Unfortunately, I am small and not that useful (female, 5'3"", 107 pounds). Thus, I can't see myself in the police force, army, electrician, or fire-fighter. I can see myself as a paramedic possibly? EHS? I know it sounds stupid, but I'm very positive there are jobs with dangerous environments that aren't just brute labor-oriented. 

Thankyou! :)

552,depression,"just something i wrote in my notes just now about how i feel and i want someone to analyze or offer me advice on what to do maybe, i don’t really know","I don’t feel good enough at anything to enjoy it. I don’t get satisfaction from anything that I would say I love, singing, playing piano, because I can’t be satisfyingly good enough. Food and shows and games just don’t seem entertaining and enough to make me want to live. I have no meaningful relationships or people that have me and only me. I don’t have anything to truly look forward to. I don’t look forward to anything but escape, and that isn’t life getting better, it’s just getting less worse. I can’t see myself happy in 10 years and I can’t think of a good way for my future to go. I can’t imagine loving someone or being loved currently, and don’t even feel a desire. I used to believe in afterlife and karma and I still kind of do but right now I’m just hoping death is a complete end and darkness that I would normally be scared of. I don’t really want help because I just want it to end and I know help is just going to be a whole lot of convincing. I can’t see myself happy in any future scenario, I don’t think anything would make me happy. I don’t think anything brings me pleasure at the moment. If I could get meds and be happier with chemicals I would do it but I know it’s not really simply possible to get those meds and continuously take them without consequences in my current situation, so I don’t see the point. I’m starting to realize that I’m the problem, not that I’m problematic or a bad person, at least I hope I am not, but maybe the way my brain is wired, I know that whatever situation I am in I will not be happy. I get what I look forward to but it does not really make things better and I will just be seen as ungrateful. Maybe it’s because it was escape like I said before, and I didn’t really get put in a good position, just a not as bad one."

I feel sort of numb. I can't remeber the last time I felt anything other than well nothing. I feel stress but other than that it's just nothing. I don't know what this is but I hate it

563,depression,Having the hardest time,"I'm really struggling. I'm dealing with ADHD, depression, anxiety, and probably some remaining symptoms of my bygone BPD diagnosis. I struggle so much with executive dysfunction, especially when it comes to school. And I only took ONE CLASS this semester to make things easier on myself, but I still managed to fail it. I just couldn't bring myself to do the work these last few months. I'm so anxious and upset with myself.


I'm supposed to be getting married this year, but my fiance is at or near his wit's end with me. He needs me to manage myself better, and I'm trying, but I feel like I can't do anything. We live in the middle of nowhere and I can't drive, so I can't get a job here to help pull my weight. He doesn't know I failed my class and I'm scared to tell him because, as he's always reminding me, it's my only real responsibility. I'm so ashamed of myself and scared that I won't be able to get better so I'll lose him.


I recently self-harmed for the first time in years. I've also been having suicidal thoughts. I used to see a DBT therapist, but they're not covered under Medicaid, so I don't have anyone to talk to about the things going on with me. All I ever want to do is sleep. I weaned myself off the highest dose of Vyvanse back in January, and it's made things so hard. I've gained a bunch of weight (a massive trigger for me), I can't focus on anything, and I'm constantly tired (sometimes I sleep for 12+ hours at a time, only to feel groggy the rest of the day). I'm depressed. I know I need to see a GP, a psychiatrist, and a therapist, but I've just turned 26 and I no longer have insurance through my parents. I enrolled for Medicaid, but I don't understand the system and haven't been able to bring myself to find doctors through the Medicaid portal. It also doesn't help that I'm moving out of state next month and will likely have to sign up all over again.

I'm sad and scared. I don't know how to get better. I don't even feel like I have the resources to get better."

565,depression,"I didn't think i had depression anymore, but I'm getting bad vibes that it's coming back but I dont feel depressed like I use to","I was diagnosed with depression when I was 16. I ran away from home at 17 after being in an abusive household and being R'd many times as a younger teen. It was extremely hard to deal with, especially with being on my own and learning about a world I wasn't allowed to learn about as a kid.
It took years to get over and many break throughs that what happened to me was not okay. I couldn't get out of bed back then. I had no want to do anything except bawl my eyes out. I even stopped drawing for an entire year (life long artist) and had to relearn everything when I went back to it.

I thought it was over. I felt so much better. I cut my dad permanently out of my life, and my mother and I have grown a great relationship after she accepted her faults with what happened during my teen years. She so wonderful now and truly tries. My fiance is the most supportive man in the world and does so much for me, and I him.

My problem - I started not sleeping again. At first it was just staying up a little later than normal, but now I'm up till the early hours in the morning and just take short naps during the day. It makes me feel so gross and sick. I feel all over again that there is something wrong with me. Im so stressed with everything.

I'm going to the doctor soon to talk about it, but I'm scared to be told I need to be evaluated again. I do not want to go through any of that process again, I dont want to deal with tears and hidden emotions. I just want to work and be happy with myself. I dont have the time to be worrying about my body or sleep.

Can anyone give me some advice on what could maybe help me in this time? I haven't experienced sleep deprivation this bad before, and worrying about if it's a sign of my depression coming back is making me feel worse and is keeping me up even later"

568,depression,I haven’t felt happy in a long time. Please help.,"I’m 19 years old. I’m laying down in bed and I’ve been crying for an hour. My thoughts have been spiraling and it’s making me really upset. Recently, I’ve been thinking a lot about my lack of friends, my intense social anxiety, my body, everything. Most of my friendships fell apart last year because of my depression. I have to get a job but it just seems so overwhelming. 

I keep thinking about how if I were to disappear only my immediate family and one friend would realize I’m missing. I don’t plan on doing anything to myself because I don’t want the people I love to go through that pain, but it just sucks knowing I have so few people who care about me. I go to college but I don’t have any friends there, and last semester some people were really mean to me undeservingly. I try to be friendly, but nothing I do really leads to any sort of relationship. I get embarrassed about 80% of my social interactions, I’m super self-conscious, I just wish I wasn’t here.

I’ve felt so disconnected from reality for a long time, and I’ve felt super depressed this past week, and on and off since I was 13. I work out occasionally, I read, play video games, do art, take my dog for walks, I do so many things that are supposed to “help” me but nothing works. I’m so tired. I’m exhausted of living like this, I just want to feel normal again. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to get back to a more normal state of mind? Please don’t say go to therapy or go to the gym, I’m sick of those answers. If you have personal anecdotes, can relate, or have any advice please comment. I hope someone sees this because I feel like I’m losing my mind. I don’t know what to do anymore."

571,depression,How to stay productive?,"Tl;dr How can I stay productive after coming out of a depressive episode?

So I’ve been doing a really bad job managing my life these past months. My biggest problem had been cleaning my room. I had not cleaned in a month, and I had piles of dirty laundry, trash laying around bc I was too lazy to put a trash bag in my trash can, a bunch of papers for school and work. Today I suddenly found the inspiration to clean it and it felt so good to do it. I feel a big weight off my shoulders.

The thing is I know I won’t always feel inspired like today. And this isn’t the first time I’ve had really bad episodes, but I’m scared of completely losing inspiration one day. I want to be able to stay consistent with things I have to do, and want to do. 

I’ve also grown more anxious about time. While I was cleaning I found my old writing and drawing journals that I loved working on. I also found a candle that a friend gifted me for Christmas, and it was a candle for Taurus season (4/20 to 5/20). I remember telling myself that I would light it when the season starts. When I found the candle today, I realized how the season had already ended, and I just felt a wave of sadness upon knowing how much time has passed and feeling like I’m wasting it.

I have a lot of goals and dreams, yet I can’t seem to work for them. I just waste so much time everyday feeling miserable. Are depressive episodes inevitable? Will I always have them? If yes, how can I better manage them? They’re just ruining my life but I can’t control it and it just feeds into my hopelessness.

I wanted to vent a bit, so you guys can ignored the ranting bit. But I do wanna know if anyone knows any tips on how to stay productive? What has worked for you?"

575,depression,I don't know if this is depression or not,"Generally, I wouldn't think of myself as depressed since I don't have most, if any, of the symptoms. However, when i went to a therapist a few years ago she said that I have it and that some of my words are a unconscious cry for help. I suffered (still suffer from, but not as severe as back then) from OCD and my life at the time was not that great. I didn't realize how miserable I was until it all crashed down in 2021 when I was at my worst. 


Anyway, shortly after it crashed down and I was recovering from that, I discovered that (at least the time) I was very excited at being at risk of physical harm. I was terrified of sitting on a motor cycle but after experiencing it (I was on the back seat) I loved it so much, I wanted to drive one on a highway. I got stung by a jellyfish and it was agonizing but after a while I had the wish to swim with one of those gigantic jellyfish.


Last but not least, the cigarette. I was smoking a cigarette but it quickly went out because of the temperature and wind conditions. Since I wasn't sure whether it was still burning deep withing or not, I pressed the cigarette butt with my thumb. I felt nothing on my thumb. So I pressed it again and then again and again."

580,depression,I just wanted to bring up something I was just reminded of right now. You have to be able to laugh at yourself. Like is too short to take everything so serious.,"I made a post a couple weeks ago or so. Being very frank and honest about my depression journey and what I’ve been doing the last few years (not much was the answer to what I’ve been doing…not much). And then very shortly after that I break up with this guy I dated for such a short period of time who really made me feel something. Made me feel alive for the first time in a long time. Made me so happy. But it ended kind of bad…I don’t think he was mature enough for a relationship yet. And I’ve been feeling sorry for myself for weeks now because I’m so hurt because this didn’t work out…and I’m watching this comedy special and it’s bringing up and honoring comedians like robin williams and Richard Pryor and…I personally love stand up comedy. I love to watch entertainment that makes me laugh. And in one of the few monologues that were given they were talking, many times, about the healing power of laughter. 

You have to be able to laugh at what goes on in the world. Even the dark stuff. Life is too short to take everything so seriously. To hang onto every negative feeling and get lost in that, and wallow, and get stuck there.

It’s hard to realize when you’re in it…Ik it’s so hard. But I used to live my life more like a comedian…to try to find the humor in the things that happen in my life. I want to try to do more of that again. Like with this relationship that has made me so sad…I can’t help but laugh at myself a little. I really put my whole heart into someone I only knew for about a month. I’m a fucking idiot lmao. I really am. But you know…I’m tired of the crying. I’m tired of sadness. In all aspects of life including this particular situation. All I can really try to do is try to grow. That’s all we can all do. This was very much a bit of a rant. It’s not very well thought out, but I hope some of you guys can relate in some way to what I’m trying to describe. Or feel inspired to take life a little less seriously also."

So on to that bullshit in front of you, you go to school or work, something forced upon your will that you can’t decline doing, as it’s something that simply “needs to be done” in pretty much every form of society known to modern man on this planet. You get through whatever horse shit you need to, and then what? 

You perhaps engage in trivial relationships that don’t last or give you the false hope of something meaningful in your life. Maybe you have sex which is a fleeting pleasure before it’s over and you are thrust back into the usual rhythm of your life. 

Maybe you have some hobbies you take part in that don’t actually mean anything beyond the false belief that they hold some form of value rather than picking things to waste away time that you wouldn’t be spending doing nothing just ticking down the seconds your life is wasting away. Maybe you take part in said hobbies to attract partners to have said relationships and sex with in some diminutive, round-about effort to tie together any meaning at all to the worthless, time wasting shit you might take part in that you believe acts as an identity to your existence. The people you wish to attract have even less substance, believing just because you’re a shmuck doing some bullshit all of a sudden they take an interest in you and decide to give you a shot at engaging in a more-than-average interaction. 

Just what the fuck is even the point? It’s all so fucking stupid, shallow, and meaningless. If life isn’t meant to be analyzed so deeply and just “enjoying the ride”, what is there to even enjoy? Getting lost in the transparency of it all? Turning a blind eye to the nothingness of the average day? Filling your schedule with aloof activities that are brainless and not meaningful in any way shape or form, just for the sake of filling time before old age and death?

Fuck, it just makes no sense to me how any of that can make people happy. It just comes off as people tricking themselves that what they’re doing is meaningful in any way. 

And then when people such as myself voice this, they say I’m just a doubter, I’m just negative, or I’ve got issues, I should see a therapist, if only I could ‘see the forest for the trees’, or people feel bad for me that I’m ‘missing out’ on life having such pessimistic views.

I just fucking hate life. I want to tell everyone about it too. I wish for those who claim to have found happiness to tell me why they think their life is actually worth living."
586,depression,Reduced sense of taste and smell,"In the past weeks my smell has disappeared. And in the past few days my taste has started to disappear. I can't really smell and taste much at all. 

I have tested for covid several times, and I don't seem to have it. 

Is it normal to experience reduced sense of taste and smell? Has anyone else experienced this and got I back?"

588,depression,Really sad but have nobody to talk too,I’m really sad and upset right now. It’s almost 4 in the morning and I just can’t sleep. I have nobody to talk too and it makes me feel bad. I feel alone and empty. I mean my “friend” isn’t sure if they wanna be my friend anymore cause of my mental health. That makes me feel like shit because I can’t help that I have mental health issues and their basically punishing me for that. Like wtf! I thought they were my bff but I honestly don’t know anymore. They said “we need a break” why did they word it like we are fucking dating. I’m not gonna lie I’m in love with them (they know I have a crush) but we are friends. Idk I have a lot of problems rn and I just need to scream ahhhhhhhh I hate being depressed cause it’s taking a toll on my health. I can’t live like this….I just can’t. I wish I had a friend to talk too
589,depression,well….,"feels like i can’t get the old me back. I haven’t been the same ever since i started antidepressants. I look at the world differently and i feel like i can never go back. in fact i’m scared i’ll have to live the rest of my life feeling like i’ll never go back to normal. I get through the day but at the end of the night i feel how alone i am. The feeling is hard to explain i feel isolated from the world. trapped in my own head my own thoughts and emotions. it’s like i can’t escape them. i feel bad for the way i push everyone away. but being by myself just helps me not take what i’m actually feeling out on everyone. Yet, all i want is my own person that’ll remind me i am loved , heard someone that can make me feel like life is worth living again. When it comes to being around family i feel my existence should be ignored. I fe terrible for how i treat them. i can’t have fun like this i feel like a lost soul."
590,depression,The closest thing,"I think I will just completely withdraw from other people and just live alone somewhere, and only ever go out for shopping for the rest of my life, until I die… it’s the closest I can get to killing myself without actually doing it, bc I don’t wanna die, but I don’t wanna live feeling like this anymore either…
Also it doesn’t help having a ”boyfriend” who writes to me ”why won’t your brain get that??????” when I am upset about something else… it hurt me too much and just makes me wanna withdraw even more…"

592,depression,Scared and confused,"Hey, I am so confused, I constantly get intrusive suicidal thoughts. However, unlike the past, I have not planned it out this time. I do imagine it sometimes though, and through that I can see the consequences I would face if I go through. Like, the pain of my parents, the way I have to face God (suicide is forbidden in my religion). I feel confused because I don't know how to deal with my emotions. I currently have no outlet to express them as my friends are equally stressed with exam season. I would say, I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill as I've always tend to exaggerate my problems. I find it worrying that I constantly seek death and self destructive ways during this period. I've been trying my best to calm my thoughts to the point I can't start studying for my next exam. I've broke down multiple times this exam week and held myself back from cutting. I am just an ordinary person, with a good life.....so why must I feel this way....my friend told me it might be because I'm constantly exposed to the trauma of others. People used to vent to me about their suicidal, depression problems very descriptively and I never stopped them, afraid that they wouldn't be able to express it and it would get worse for them. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeling this horrible feeling of sadness deep within me, every time I'm no longer in contact with a person. When I'm with someone, I can rely on their energy to be happy and keep the mood. I hope I'm happy during those times....if i wasn't....that would be sadder. These thoughts and feelings started before my exams were close. I know it's mostly because of my overthinking, but I don't know how to stop it. I only escape to social media, stories, movies, etc. At this point, I'm just trying every healthy way possible to escape it and be a normal person so I don't burden anyone."
593,depression,i don’t want to be here :),"My life has been slowly going downhill, like a train heading towards a cliff on fixed tracks just waiting to crash and burn. A few years ago, right before COVID-19 hit I felt lost in my life. Even though i was pursuing what i thought id wanted to do my whole life, i didn’t feel like me. once covid started to spread and the school i was attending shut down i tried to focus more on finding myself but ended up more lost and depressed than before. i made some insane decisions, and while i regret none of it, i wished that i had actually learned from them. i have been in the same pattern for the last 3years at least. and nothing but negativity has come from it. no matter how many times i try to break free i feel powerless as i watch myself subconsciously fall into the same patterns over and over again. i got married in january 2022 and spent the first few months of my marriage homeless with my husband. we are finally in a place but our marriage is struggling. i don’t feel happy and i don’t know if i’m not happy with him or if i’m unhappy all around. i don’t feel like he cares about me. i worked so hard to get us into the place we are in now but now that we are here i’m doubting if i made the right choice. i don’t feel like he understands just how hard this is for me. we just moved from the only place i’ve ever lived to a city 3.5+hrs away from any of my family. i have no friends, im struggling to find a new job, money is tight, and i don’t have any will to live. he doesn’t seem to think about me anymore and seems uninterested in the words that i have to say. i just want things to get better."
594,depression,I ended up in the ward,"Tw: suicide attempt, please remove if not allowed 

.

.

.
So I ended up in a psych ward last week from trying to unalive because of a lot that is going on, for everyone I have clinical depression and anxiety along with adhd and ptsd so if can’t get worse right? Wrong.
I lost 6 people my dad, two aunts, 3 friends all in the span of 8 months and on top of it my relationship is failing and it’s my fault.
During the 8 months after my dad past and the others that died in between I laid in bed and did nothing ( I used the bathroom took showers and went to therapy that’s it) to the point my boyfriend got upset with me saying I’m not doing enough like cleaning up the house or cooking.
Recently I bought a car and learned to drive and got a job and thought my life was going to be fine until I got into an accident before getting my permit,(I was taking the car to the dealership mechanic) and my boyfriend yelled and yelled and yelled at me till I had a panic attack and he continued to yell still I tried getting out the car at a red light on the highway to walk and calm down but he pulled me back in the car by my shirt. He still was yelling at me. At this point I straight up told him I wanted to die it was something I’ve been fighting for awhile, he still yelled at me. To the point when we got home I attempted. I told him only because I realized it wasn’t worth it, he took me to the hospital he cried for a brief second but the rest I was doing everything alone. He came to visit me when I was there but he tried to bring up the argument again. I feel like shit. 
I feel like everything is my fault. And maybe just maybe if he wasn’t with me his life would be better I don’t know why he stays."
595,depression,Having a Rough Time,"This is a burner account because I feel a little uncomfortable sharing. I’ve got a shoulder surgery lined up soon and I’m feeling pretty off about it. I know I’m doing the right thing by getting it but I live a pretty active lifestyle and I’m at the point where I can’t do the things I love at this point in my life, I try to tell my friends and girlfriend how I feel and it just feels like they’re brushing aside what I’m going through and how much this is affecting me. I feel so isolated and alone and the thoughts I’m having about myself are a little frightening. It’s hard for me to look in the mirror sometimes and I feel like a failure of a man. My thoughts are crushing me and I’m constantly in pain, I don’t know where else to turn so this is my Hail Mary pass of hoping this will help in some capacity. Thank you if you decide to respond I appreciate your time."
596,depression,I thought it'd be different,"I had my daughter in August. She is beautiful and wonderful and absolutely makes my entire day every day. I was so in love with her, that I never thought I'd ever be depressed again. I thought to myself, ""I have this beautiful child, a loving husband, and a whole future ahead of me.""

My mother battled depression a lot when I was growing up. She used it against my siblings and myself for any reason she saw fit, and would tell us all the time she would kill herself. She had tried a couple of times in front of me while laughing at my attempts to stop her. 

I thought when I had my daughter, it'd be so much different. I thought it'd flip a switch in my brain and I'd never feel depressed or suicidal again. A silly idea, I know. But now, if I get suicidal ideations, I feel even more like shit. If I start feeling too depressed, I blame myself for not doing more for my child. 

Despite knowing that I am very different from my mother, it hits me really hard. I want to be able to give myself the grace I need when I feel like this, and all I can think about is that I'm a shit person and parent because I don't love my daughter enough to not be sad"
597,depression,;(,[removed]
598,depression,"Only recently realized that I'm still depressed, just not as bad","I spent most of my teen years severely depressed, to the point of hospitalization. I've been on and off too many medications to remember (most with little results) and have seen several therapists. The past two years I haven't been on any antidepressants, haven't harmed myself, graduated college, found a partner who I love dearly, got a full-time job and built some savings. This is genuinely the best that I've been doing since I was a young child and I stopped thinking of myself as being in the ""depression zone,"" yknow? 

Recently I was talking to someone (who does not know much about my past history) about how I have no motivation to pursue my past dreams, and how I feel constantly stressed at work. They suggested that I sound depressed and it took that comment to realize that I still am. I think I got so used to severe, all-consuming symptoms that being at a stage where I find some happiness and productivity on a regular basis made me feel like I'm no longer depressed. I forgot that it's not normal to cry in my car several times per week before work, and to feel like I'm past my peak at 22. Because compared to where I was at 16, I'm doing great. 

I want to be alive, and I wouldn't say that I feel ""sad"" most of the time, but I'm just trudging along. Like the past decade has been a constant uphill battle and now I've just plateaued. In a weird way, it's more unsettling to be mildly content than to be in crisis mode all of the time. I feel like I lost my childhood/young adulthood in a way that I can't explain to most people and now that things are relatively normal, I have to appear as if I feel normal when I don't. I can't relate to my coworkers but I also can't let myself live the way that I used to. I'm not really sure what to do."
599,depression,"I call mine ""Multo""","So I've learned that Ghost in Tagalog (Filipino language) is ""Multo"" and called my anxiety attacks that so I can openly say it sometimes without them knowing i meant it like that. My family , as far as I know them , wouldn't understand even if I directly say I have depression to them and for sure if I did constantly say I'm having an anxiety attack they wouldn't believe me more as well as they'll prolly shrug me off more so everytime I go in the state I always say "" Minumulto ako "" ( which I've learned that it means I'm being haunted ) so that at least they'll try to comfort me as well as a defense mechanism for myself that I'm making myself aware that I am having an attack so it does help a little. Also because of this , my brain got hotwired that if I repeat saying so I'll eventually close my eyes like I'm really being haunted by a ghost which helps me cool down.

I don't know that point of this post actually but surely I want to post it for maybe when I'm done with this , I want to look back and see that I've been struggling to a point I'm calling my panic attacks ""Multo""

Thank you for reading my dumb post and idk I hope it helped you anyhow. I'm also aware of what's happening to me so thanks but no thank you kind sir but I don't need cliche words that's prolly something you've had said to someone else."
600,depression,i just made this account. might regret posting but here goes nothing,"i hate living. i hate myself. i hate school. i hate working every weekend. i hate being an adult. i wanna go back to being a little girl. i have about 24 hours to turn in 4 essays or i will fail my literature class. i keep having moments where i feel fine and sure that everything will be OK, then that feeling disappears and i am upset and lonely again. i remember when i was little. i liked school, had friends, always did my homework, had good grades. what happened? why am i like this? why am i such a failure? does my family get tired of me? sometimes i wonder if i should’ve have taken my own life back in 2019, like i was sure i would. i just don’t know anymore. i’m sorry. i’m sorry to everyone i am a burden to. i’m sorry to my mom, dad, siblings, grandparents, and others. i’m sorry to all of you. i am going to cry myself to sleep and secretly hope i don’t wake up."
601,depression,Told my mom and sister about having suicidal thoughts for the last 2 years,"I've had a talk with my sister and mom today. It was more of a breakdown really. Over the last two years I can't seem to stop going into episodes of completely stopping to function as a human. I stay in bed for weeks. I either do not eat or I stuff myself with junk food. Up until yesterday, I had bags from delivered takeout and food wrapping surrounding my bed, and spilling all the way to my kitchen. My mom is visiting me for a few weeks, so I spent 12 hours from 9 pm to 9 am of the next day walking around and collecting all the trash, vaccuming, and cleaning because I was so deathly afraid of anyone in my family finding out. In fact, thats the only thing that gets me out of bed ever anymore. 

I honestly don't see the point in doing anything. I just want to die. I have a plan on how I will do it. The only thing stopping me before was knowing how selfish it would be to kill myself without even attempting to talk to my parents or sister beforehand. I spent the whole 12 hours running through a conversation in my head about where I was at, and how bad it had gotten. When it came time for it, I only got maybe 10% of what I wanted to say. It sucked. It was the hardest conversation I had to have with anyone before. 

I honestly thought they understood, and I was finally seeing a future for myself. Maybe if my family understood and was willing to help me, my life wasn't over. Maybe I was right in not killing myself earlier.

Well it's been about 5 hours since, and my mother has been asking nonstop questions like ""how come you have so much laundry not done"" or ""how come you gained so much weight"". She just recently told me ""Maybe its not your mental health, maybe youre just lazy. It looks like youre incapable of being an adult.""

That fucking hurt man. It hurts because there are times when I think the exact same thing. I think to myself that I am just a burden on my family, so suicide is the objectively right desicion for me. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. All i know is that the only thing that was stopping me before is the hope that once I opened up, I would have people who would be willing to help, or at least willing to understand. It's clear that i was wrong for hoping that. 

Honestly idk why I wrote all of this out. I'm not really looking for help from stangers online. I guess I just wanted to share. Maybe I just wanted to rant, and I will wake up tomorrow and things will seem better. Maybe I'll wake up and my mind won't be changed, and I am just writing this as my suicide note before I drive up to the GGB and roll the dice. I guess I will see what tomorrow brings."
602,depression,So sick of existing,I'm getting so sick and tired of myself. Every job I get I hate. I currently work for Apple - I thought it would be diffrent but it's the same bs. Rude coworkers and entitled customers. I am currently a Junior maajoring in Computer Science (and I still have not clue wtf I am doing - I can barely code). I just want to curl into a ball and hide. I am a mom and I am 100% sure if I did not jave to take care of here that i would not be here anymore. Navigating life is so exhausting - I feel the need to be perfect but U am so far from it and it makes me feel so worthless. Coporate is so obsessed with metrics and they forget we are human to.
603,depression,Intervention,My roommates brought their mother over and basically had an intervention with me. My depression has steadily gotten worse through the years and I recently had come up with a date and a plan to end my suffering. I am best friends with my roommates so I confided in one of them and she ended up telling her therapist about my plan which then led to her calling her mom and her mom coming over and telling me to admit myself to a behavioral center. It was very awkward for me. Very uncomfortable during this. But I do think it’s the push and the help I need. I’m writing this as I sit in the lobby waiting to be seen by a psychiatrist. I’m tired. I’m exhausted. I don’t know how to feel. I’m nervous they won’t be able to “fix” me and I’ll come back to real life and still dread everything.
604,depression,I think I need help,"18 and i feel completely wasted and drained till the last few months, no drive and energy to nothing i don't know if I'm being over or anything but I'm honest self projecting here, 

I feel life is like a meaning less book and i just can't be happy unless i get a validation from my friends or family, that time i feel a bit better and I'm being very lazy lately maybe that's the reason im like this but it feels I'm lazy because i have zero energy

I literally force myself every day to do things but after all of this bullshit i just can't cry, sometimes i think if only i could just cry I'll feel a bit better l but i just can't its been years i cried. 

I'm constantly having a feeling that I'm just being very wear but i don't know I'm being or not, but everything i said is happening to me i feel zero happiness by myself. 

If anyone knows anything about these, please help me i need that i think."
605,depression,fuck,"every day is a fucking nightmare. The past few weeks have felt like fucking in suing doom every single day. 

i’ve gone to my University counting center twice this week and I’m planning on going back next week. 

my first ever girlfriend broke up with me yesterday. She said that she thinks that I don’t like her as much as I just like the idea of having a girlfriend. 

it came out of nowhere. I never seen it coming. She gave me the whole It’s not you it’s me deal blaming it all on her self. 

I wonder if it’s because I was too open about my mental health with her. 

I just walked in the freezing cold 2 miles from my dorm to the area near my dads house. 

I don’t think I can go to class with her tomorrow morning I can’t take it. 

this Couldn’t have come at a worse fucking time, my life is falling apart. 

everything seemed so great between us at least I thought that way.  

Now I’m back to fucking square one. Being a fucking fat, anxious, depressed, sad, panicky, miserable, single fucking loser. 

This semester started off so promising. Now there’s only three weeks left I’m not ready for my music juries, I’m gonna fail my English class, and my girlfriend dumped me.

608,depression,I’ve reached the point where no one can comfort me anymore.,"Today I went for beers with my best friend and completely broke down. What started out as casually just getting a beer ended up with me bawling in the middle of a brewery with him trying to convince me that everything’s gonna be OK and everyone feels the same. Usually I’m at least somewhat content after a deep talk with someone I trust but today nothing really made me feel better and I feel like he wasn’t able to cover me or console me. I just started a new job and it really looks like it’s gonna suck a lot more than my previous one although I hated that one too, we’re supposed to move away out of state for someone more affordable the end of the year but it seems like that they always push back and that’s really the only thing I’m looking forward to. I just really don’t know what to think anymore and I feel like my depression reached a point where having a talk with someone doesn’t mean you’re feeling better or delay my depression at all, I’ve tried to go speak with a therapist but I just have no motivation to do anything. I know what I need to do and I know what I need to address but I have no motivation to fix it at this point I feel like I’ve just given up. Sorry if it’s just a ramble but I’m just, I don’t even know why I’m posting this I don’t know anyone’s gonna say and I know anything in here if the Internet isn’t gonna make me feel better but I just felt like I needed to rant and seems like a place to do it so thank you.,

609,depression,Good life,"I am in my mid twenties and have not done anything with my life. I did not finish high school and I haven't had a job. For the last couple of years I can count on one hand how often I have left the house.  I used to have some friends, at least I think they were my friends, but I haven't had the courage to reach out to them because of my anxiety. When I even try and think about meeting people I get anxious. Being alone for years has really messed me up. I have had several breakdowns and broke my hand by punching a wall at one point. I don't even know what the first step to get my life back on track would be."
610,depression,Is my Depressed BF up to no good?? is this a recipe for cheating?!,"i (24f) am i hardworking gf who has a full time high paying job as a consultant in a top firm, graduated university in 2020 etc. My bf (23m) of 9 months on the other hand, is a bit behind for his age - he has depression and lives at home, is transferring from community college to a 4 year college this coming fall. Currently, he has a part time job and is finishing up community college credits and is waiting to hear back from summer internships which we are all very nervous he won't get since he's still at a CC (doesn't meet a lot of internship requirements)...

Anyways, all he does is wake up, go to the gym, do his school work (doesn't even get Great grades btw), does his part time job (2x a week at most), ""reads"" or goes on his phone. He has one hobby which he does 2x a week at most. he tries to see me everyday since he has nothing else to do.

I have a bad fear that he is just jerking off daily because he is so bored- there is NO way someone is up to any good with this much free time on his or her hands. It literally sickens me that he has so much free time with god knows what he's doing, while i am working hard advancing my career with long hours and using my brain for 10 hours straight (i feel fulfilled). Kid doesn't even know what he wants to do in in life as a full time career because he is so damn directionless and his depression does nOT help.

It makes me scared that he is bored, has depression, and has very low confidence- this is all a recipe for cheating imo. We are both trying to seek separate therapy (not going well since the therapists we tried contacting didn't call back). there's a glimmer of hope that he is open to it because of his depression.

TLDR: In a rut with my bf and idk what to do. Also, do not suggest we break up because i'm not ready for that yet. thank you."

613,depression,I don't know how to be anyone but myself.,"The Japanese have a saying, we wear three types of masks. One mask we wear for the world, one mask we wear for our loved ones and on mask we wear only for ourselves.

The lines are blurred for me.

I am myself in every way, my raw human self. Unfiltered &amp; mostly unmasked (aside from sexual proclivity and suicidal ideation). I struggle to separate my home self from my professional self. I struggle to be anything *but* honest and open. It's a flaw that has ruined many professional opportunities, relationships and most of my social life.

I love myself but hate how it's so isolating to be me.

I know that I am only a single person on this big planet, and my experience is not only my own but also an imprint that effects others, no matter how small.

Many people have far more difficult lives but I'd rather not compare myself to others with a yard stick that isn't mine. My wish is to just share in this breif moment how truly and utterly alone I feel, in a life that only seems to be fighting me each and every step of the way. I never thought I'd be perpetually swimming against this insufferable current."

619,depression,Herpes has made my life a LIVING FUCKING HELL!,"Yes, I take valacyclovir and l lysine and vitamin c. Yes, I know that most of the world population has herpes. But that has not stopped hsv1 or hsv2 herpes from destroying my life  since getting them last year:

\-Before herpes, I was maybe a 5/10 now I'm 1/10. Dating was already an uphill battle for me due to my autism, now that I have herpes. I just do not have the will to pursue relationships anymore, I just fucking don't.  I'm in my mid 20s which is considered prime dating years and i've already fucked everything up. I know they're working on a cure but chances are, it wont be finished until im in my fucking 30s. And even if I found someone for me now I'd live in constant fear of giving them this fucking disease because these meds dont fucking do anything and I have Hsv1 oral and Hsv2 genital and constant outbreaks and prodrome my partner would guaranteed to get one if we had sex or even kissed.

\-I live in constant fear of this fucking disease spreading to my organs and nervous system and I think it actually fucking has because i have constant fucking headaches and intense migraines, searing eye pain and outbreaks on my scalp and neck. I live in constant continuous fear of death. Plus I have a concussion and brain injury from boxing and martial arts so i cant even exercise anymore without raising my blood pressure and risking my BBB barrier degrading and exposing the virus to my fucking brain. So I'm becoming fatter.  I'm also balding btw and no im not taking fucking drugs to that have even A 1 PERCENT chance of chemically castrating me, not only that I have no idea how these drugs will interact with herpes and my brain injury recovery because there aren't enough studies because no one fucking cares because it wont make any fucking money because cases like me are rare. My room is full of tissue paper on the floor because everytime I scratch a sore, I splatter my hands and tissue in hand sanitizer and wipe my face and ears and even eyes sometimes and Ive just become so broken i just throw the shit on the ground. My home is filthy because I've just given up i cant even exercise anymore because the combination of brain injury and herpes putting intense fear into me. i might just start shitting my bed and urinating myself honestly. 

\-I cant even eat my favorite foods anymore any time I eat anything with sugar I start experiencing tingles.itching, and outbreaks. I cant eat chocolates or gorge on turkey and cake during thanksgiving with my family. Everytime i eat a new food I always have to google the arginine content because a slight difference means the difference between life and death. I refuse to risk it. Having herpes and being sad because you cant get a date is one thing, but i literally live in fear of my demise. Honestly, If sometimes I wish i'd rather have HIV because at least the drugs for those functionally suppress the condition for most people. as long as they can keep getting their drugs. herpes drugs barely do shit for me. 

I can't even hug or touch my family members anymore because I'm constantly afraid of spreading this hellish virus to them which i think i might have. Everytime I take a piss on the toilet seat or a shit, I wipe the toilet down with clorox wipes because I quiver in fear at the thought of spreading this to them. Not only that I cant even tell my parents or siblings I have this because I know my mom would experience emotional turmoil if she knew her son had an incurable disease that has ruined his fucking life. It's a good thing I dont live with them but I'm considering moving to another state just so I cannot risk them hugging  or kissing me and getting this virus. This virus causes me constant pain so no i will not treat this virus like its something okay to casually transmit its fucking not.

I'm just so pissed, in school and on the internet they tell us herpes is no big deal and that our immune systems alone will deal with it 9 times out of 10 and theres essentially no risk of the more serious complications of herpes  unless your immunocompromised, and they basically make it seems like hiv is all you have to worry about. I used condoms and had ""safe"" sex and got herpes because I viewed it as not having a big deal. But its totally a big fucking deal and it seems to be a way stronger virus than they've told us about, At least in my case. The fucked up part is that I didnt really want to sleep around that was just to feel my void for a long term monogamous relationship which my autism and looks prevented me from getting so i just settled on quick raunchy hookups, now i cant even do those anymore because im worried about worsening my situation. All i can do is masturbate and masturbate and masturbate and daydream and cry and just leave the lights off and masturbate more.  I just feel like nothing can make this better and there's no way this situation can be improved unless they came out with a solid legit cure by next year or at least prilivir. HOLY FUCK!"
620,depression,What part is this,"Who else here finally has a cope and can deal with life again. At least I know that this will all end and it will be a day like this where I have to die. Imagine being old and feeling like I have to go out soon why did time fly by so quickly. It felt like yesterday
Even google says that death isn't painful but I'm not really sure"
621,depression,i'm tired of feeling like a second option (advice/opinion needed),"i had (have??? i don't know at this point) a really close friend and we used to talk constantly, like from waking up to going to bed (with the exception of school and other responsibilities). i always felt super happy talking to them and they were honestly the highest of my day.

the problem is they are now talking hours, and even up to a day, to reply to my messages, even if it's just a ""hi"" or ""how are you"". now i completely understand that everyone has responsibilities and are not available 24/7, but what upsets me the most is that they're active of social media and constantly posting and not answering me.

i never try to get them to reply to me, i just wait it out until they do, but it's never anything interesting or fun. they've mentioned it before how they have issues with moving on quickly from person-to-person, and right now i feel like i'm only worth talking to while they're other person aren't around.

i don't know if i should like an asshole for saying this but it genuinely hurts me knowing i'm not as important to them anymore and that my feelings don't really matter. at the same time, it makes me quite mad and irritated that i've spent so much time and energy treating them as a priority in my life just feel like a ""back-up plan""

i guess i'm just wondering what do i do now? i feel like just giving up on the friendship completely, i don't think i could ever not feel like a second option again, and i guess i'm just giving up on them as a whole.

i don't know what to do and it just feels lonely here now. what do you even do in this situation and how to you cope with this?"
622,depression,not a new question but a real one I've struggled w/ on and off: Why go on living? I am not having SI or anything like that. just a low low,"I know why we're all alive: to procreate
To be part of some large ecosystem (the earth), although I'm not sure we help
To avoid pain of loved ones if we were to go away, but if they weren't alive--or we all died at the same time--why again?
Is it to take life and civilization as far as humans can? To what end?
Etc.

There are always countless philosophical debates on this, but frankly philosophers I've met have been incredibly pretentious and unfun. Not generalizing overall, AND right now I don't want to go and read Nietzsche et al and probably never ever

What do you think? Is this really just an age-old question that no one can answer? 

Diagnosed with MDD, anxiety, OCD, maybe ADHD, maybe on the spectrum, so there's plenty for me to unpack regarding depression. Hope to add more to this community as the days go on, or don't!

I'm feeling really low and this thought tends to come up around now. I don't want to die. I just chase the answer to if my being here fundamentally matters, and I just can't figure it out. I have a therapist, partner, family, great job. Still, here I am. 

Thanks for your thoughts. Could really use them tonight, y'all"

625,depression,Scared of disappointing my parents,"**Long read**
18m My parents had a significantly worse upbringing than me. My dad lived in a semi-poor rural farm in Italy, and my mom lived on top of my grandmothers shop in a beach town barely getting by. When I was a toddler my dad bought a bar and worked 60-70 hours a week to pay the bills, and my mom owned a art shop also putting in a lot of work. They worked insanely hard and it paid off because when I was 5 we moved to America, a year before my little brother was born. Grew up comfortable but early experienced hardship and responsibility, and man am I regretting it now. Now, I’m a freshman in community college with a 2.5 gpa since I made the shitty mistake of falling into the party lifestyle 11-12th grade and now finally realizing I need to grow tf up. I have no idea what I want to do with my life, I’m a undecided major and I just don’t see a future in some 9-5 job. I feel like a failure because I don’t have the insane work ethic my parents had at my age. I didn’t give a fuck about anything the last two years of high school, I would go to class high and hung out with druggies who didn’t do anything but smoke weed and do drugs. I wish I could talk to my 16 year old self and tell him to stop being a lazy dumbass, because I am really regretting it now. I want to transfer to a better college and get a well paying job but my gpa is a 2.5, nothing special at all, and even though I still have another year to raise it, Im scared I’ll fuck it up. I just don’t want to disappoint my parents, all this work for their son to be a failure."
626,depression,i’m still here,"though about kms a lot the past few weeks but i’m still here and im counting that as a win.
fighting every single day to stay and finding reasons to stay is far more worth it than giving up."
627,depression,Anybody want to talk,[removed]
628,depression,"Not sure if this is depression, but I didn’t know were else to ask this.","I feel like I can’t enjoy movies or tv shows anymore because they feel unfamiliar even when they are very familiar. I have to think so much just to comprehend simple things like character motives, plot developments, character relationships, etc. 

I forget what happened in previous episodes so quickly. 

Ive been struggling to follow plots in movies, shows, and books lately because I can’t keep up or get engulfed in the overall universe of the story like I used to be able to do effortlessly. Even if I’m watching my favorite show for the 10th time I have to concentrate super hard to be able to absorb it enough to enjoy it. I have to manually remind myself things that I would typically remember immediately &amp; effortlessly. It’s like everything feels unfamiliar even though it’s not. 

Part of me thinks I’m overthinking, but I also feel like I can’t just turn my brain off because than I’m not focusing. This has never been an issue for me until about the last year or so. Early onset dementia?? Brain tumor?? Going insane?? Depression?? Overthinking?? Lol help me plz."
629,depression,College depression,I don’t feel like I’m gonna have anyone on campus this upcoming school year and it’s honestly making me very depressed. I think it’s typical of young people but I just assume everyone hates me? I haven’t done anything wrong but slowly both irl since I’m moving away I’ll lose all my friends and go to a new campus and be depressed there. I don’t feel like I have anyone genuinely to talk to about it.

I constantly think about how I want to kill myself but because of the stigma around depression and how I come from a religious family, I have not had the courage to do it yet. I try my best to not resent my parents for bringing me into this world but I just wish I was never born to begin with."

637,depression,i fell asleep in march 2020 and forget to ever wake up,"i don't know what this is. I guess i hope someone will say the feel the same. ah. I remember when the pandemic broke out it was like I switched off, like i began hibernating, waiting for my life to rev up again and resume normal programming. Weeks past, then months, now years. I still feel this overwhelming sense of dulled anticipation. Like i am at the starting line, and any day now, i'll begin the run which is my life, but the time is never coming to actually start, so i have just powered off, waiting for something to switch me back on again. At first i thought it would come, but now it's been so long that i dont know, im exhausted. Doesnt help i turned 18 in april 2020. Literally became an adult and left home during this shit. The world is not really restricted whatsoever anymore, but i still feel like i'm waiting for the pandemic to end. It's like every false alarm that 'covid is gone!' followed by yet another lockdown has totally broken my trust in 'normal life', i just don't believe that my sens of normalcy and stability won't be taken away again. I am also totally depersonalised, spaced out all the time. I just can't fathom how i went from who i was two years ago to who i am now. I don't have a clue of who i am, what i want, where i am going. How can I when i have spent two years avoiding everything, because i juuuust need to wait a liiiittle longer before bloody living. it's like i have this deep sense of grief for what could have been had covid never happened. It ruined friendships, a relationship, took away my first choice University, forced me into loneliness and isolation. It just ruined everything. Anyway. sorry for the rant, i don't really have anywhere else to put these thoughts."

639,depression,Is being chronically tired a sign of being depressed?,Basically I feel like I’m exhausted every day despite getting “enough” sleep where I shouldn’t feel this way. This has been going on for a really long time (years) and otherwise I’m physically healthy so I’m starting to wonder if this is tied to how emotionally I’m not always in a great place. I have good days and bad days but the tiredness never goes away no matter how good I feel.
640,depression,I am Fully Convinced The Universe has Decided I Don’t Belong Here,"For Context I have had Clinical Depression for about Three Years now. Ive taken various different medications and although they take the edge off, Ive never felt true happiness for an extended period of time. I generally suffer from mood swings between anger, depression, and feeling content. I’m pretty sure I have Borderline Personality Disorder or Psychopathy because I fit every textbook requirement, but whenever I bring it up to a psychiatrist, they just tell me to switch antidepressants. So, I take the pills and go about with my life, still managing to get A’s in school and keep myself alive out of a sheer basic discipline somewhere inside me. But it’s all painfully hard. I have no motivation for anything, I have trouble going to sleep, and I never feel good about anything that I do. All I feel every moment of every day is either crushing anxiety or complete self loathing and worthlessness.

What truly brings me down is that outside of the present moment I am in, I feel like I don’t even exist. I have a lot of friends that I am close with, and have an active social media presence, and yet not a single person besides my parents wished me happy birthday when I turned 19 a few weeks ago. Even in the world of everybody posting birthday wishes on instagram stories all the time, I was forgotten by all the people I know. Things only get even more upsetting to me when I take into consideration that my close friends are all thriving for the most part. Even though one broke up with his girlfriend who didn’t want to talk to him, he found a better girl the next day and they are happily together. Every one of my close friends is in a long term relationship. Ive never even been on a single date in my entire life. We’re all kinda nerds, but I am by far the most charismatic and conventionally attractive member of that friend group, but it’s like there is just something in the way that makes it so that people never ask me out, and the people I find attractive are never anywhere to be seen. Ive been on dating apps for months now, and I haven’t even gotten a single match.

The real icing on the cake is that I am an actor who is really going through it right now. I am at a prestigious theatre program at an LA university, and after an entire year have not been cast in a single thing despite watching the other auditioners who I believe have objectively less talent land the roles. I don’t want to hear the response of “acting is a hard business, most people don’t make it”. I’m well aware of that but I’m doing it because I need to and fully believe I have what it takes to be a massive success. There is no other option for me, because I know that if not for acting, I most certainly wouldn’t be here to tell this story. Ive gotten to points that low several times, but I never actually have a desire to end my own life, because then I can’t prove myself. All I can do is simply wish I were dead every moment of every day.

All in all, with nobody to love and no roles coming my way, I really feel like it’s just a matter of me being a mistake. I don’t even feel real anymore. I’m just a husk going moment to moment doing what I need to do knowing that Im going down a path to failure."

642,depression,Thinking about giving up on treatment,"I’ve been depressed for over 13 years now. Started going to therapy last year in December. Started seeing a psychiatrist in February. Currently on meds. Already quit therapy because I hated it and it made me feel worse. It’s not even about the therapist, I just didn’t learn anything new really and it all just doesn’t appeal to me. I tried healthy diet, excercising, hobbies, learning new things, journaling and a ton of different things. I have a job, graduated from college, I’ve been in a wonderful relationship for 8 years now. Still stuck with severe depression, got diagnosed with anxiety&amp;depressive personality disorder. Dealing with it on my own is just as „effective” as this whole „treatment”, just cheaper… I have an appointment with my psychiatrist today and I’m just so fed up with all of this. I don’t expect anyone to encourage me to keep going. Just wanted to get it off my chest."
643,depression,I wish I could show my mom how thankful I am for her,"My moms been with me through everything. I’m physically and mentally ill and she’s always been there for me. I want to show her how grateful I am but my depression makes me unable to do anything. I want to succeed for her and make money to make her life easy after all that she’s sacrificed for me but I can’t. My depression makes it impossible. I’ve barely scraped by my classes for college, I’ve failed a ton and dropped out of some, I have to do make up work over the summer and am going to graduate two semesters later than my peers all because of my depression. I know her seeing me succeed despite it all would make her so happy but I can’t even manage to get out of bed in the morning. I’m probably going to drop out of college and I just feel terrible. I wish I didn’t have depression and I wish I could give my mom the world because she deserves it"

I have stayed away from PMO,Gaming since 2 days . My Porn choice has escalated has so so much in 2-3 years to the point I feel like a sick addict loser. Guys,please dont watch porn . It really screws your life up. 

I have done NoFap and No gaming in the past for 90 days and 115 days respectively but always came back to Porn,Masturbation and Gaming. 

I am a college student and right now my main problem is absolute lack of concentration while studying. I can do other things perfectly with concentration but can’t concentrate at all in my studies no matter what. This is getting really frustrating since I have finals coming up in 2 months. 

Is it because of low dopamine and dopamine receptors downregulation? Am I depressed? Is it because of Anxiety? Because I do think I have social anxiety. I thought I had ADD in the past but I dont think I have ADD because I can’t concentrate in studies only. I can concentrate on other things perfectly. 

Will taking anti-depressant or anti-anxiety medication help me to concentrate. Please Help. I am really frustrated because my exams are coming and all I do is day dream and can’t concentrate at all :("

649,depression,"I just don't know where to start, looking for help on this...","Basically the title says it all. I'm constantly drinking to get through the day, and I can barely get out of bed. I'm gainfully employed at least, I have an amazing wife and child but I've been self medicating with alcohol for damn near two years.
 
Luckily for me, I am 100% remote with my job. When I was going into the office cocaine was abundant so I was doing it almost every day, all day.  Being remote has helped in that respect at least, but now I'm just constantly miserable and can't stop drinking to get through the day.
 
I guess the main thing my brain keeps fucking with me about is this feeling of existential dread. I'm constantly scared about what the future might hold, and in particular I constantly stress about what my child will have to deal with in the future.
 
I feel extremely stupid for living this way, something is wrong with my brain. We are totally fine financially and I'm pretty sure my daughter will never want for anything. I just can't seem to find any reason to go on, and I know this isn't right. 
 
I am, at least for now, still a functioning alcoholic. I don't lash out or cause too much grief for my family and friends. That said I just can't continue on this path and I don't really know where to go to get some help.
 
I tried a therapist last year but they ended up matching me with a young woman who really couldn't relate with (I'm an older guy, pushing 50). So yeah, I ended up ghosting that therapist and haven't sought any help since then.
 
I dunno, I'm just tired all the time and I know none of this is rational. I was just hoping maybe someone on this sub could relate and help steer me towards a solution. Should I find a psychiatrist and try to get medicated?  I'm sure therapy could also help, but I also think I might need some kind of medication to help with this constant gloom.

That's all I've got. I just really want to be more in the moment and more present with my family but I'm struggling every damn day. Any suggestions are welcome, thanks for reading."

Theres only so much someone can take, everyone has thier limits and I'm pushing mine.

651,depression,Important Information about Anhedonia / Low Hedonic Tone (Core Symptom of Clinical Depression),"""Anhedonia, defined as the state of reduced ability to experience feelings of pleasure, is one of the hallmarks of depression. However, the term anhedonia is insufficient to summarize the intricate and multidimensional reward-associated deficits displayed by patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Deficits in reward-related processing may present as loss of interest or pleasure and may impede an individual’s ability to engage in goal-directed behavior. These behaviors may include the lack of anticipation or prediction of expected rewards, lack of ability to evaluate the perceived values and costs associated with anticipated rewards, inability to gauge the amount of effort required to attain rewards, inability to evaluate whether the effort is sufficiently rewarded, and lack of motivation to execute actions required to attain rewards."" 

""If anhedonia is the state of reduced ability to feel pleasure, then hedonic tone, also referred to as hedonic capacity or hedonic responsiveness, is the trait or genetic predisposition underlying one’s baseline range and lifelong characteristic ability to feel pleasure. Low hedonic tone represents a reduced capacity to experience pleasure at any given time, thus increasing the likelihood of experiencing anhedonia.[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b6-ndt-12-2149),[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b7-ndt-12-2149)""

""Low hedonic tone has been associated with several psychopathologies, including major depressive disorder (MDD), substance use, and schizophrenia,[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b8-ndt-12-2149),[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b9-ndt-12-2149) although variations in hedonic tone can also be observed in healthy individuals.[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b10-ndt-12-2149)""

""It can be hypothesized that individuals suffering with genetically lower set point, or lower hedonic tone, will need to do more to feel neutral or euthymic, resulting in an increased need for stimulation.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b11-ndt-12-2149) In part, this may manifest as seeking external stimulation (eg, dangerous or risky behavior and substance abuse) or internal stimulation (eg, fantasy) that will raise their hedonic tone.[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b12-ndt-12-2149) Regardless of the choice to externally or internally raise their hedonic tone, patients with this trait would consistently attempt to cope by finding ways to maximize pleasure and raise mood from their low baseline tone. Furthermore, when stimulation is absent, individuals with low hedonic tone would be hypothesized to experience a shift toward that individual’s more usual lower hedonic tone and therefore suffer a drop in their mood to their more common baseline dysphoric state ([Figure 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/figure/f1-ndt-12-2149/)).[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b12-ndt-12-2149)""

""Thus, it is not surprising that a large body of evidence points to the involvement of the reward system, particularly the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, in mediating the degree of anhedonia at any given time[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b6-ndt-12-2149),[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b7-ndt-12-2149) as well as the risk of developing dysthymia and depression.[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b13-ndt-12-2149),[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b14-ndt-12-2149) Recent research into the neurobiology of anhedonia has focused on neurobiology of reward and motivation and has identified associated dopaminergic circuits as playing a key role in the maintenance of hedonic tone,[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b2-ndt-12-2149),[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b4-ndt-12-2149),[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b15-ndt-12-2149),[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b16-ndt-12-2149) specifically neural circuits that contain bottom-up and top-down projections into the prefrontal cortex (PFC), lateral habenula, and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine (DA) system.[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b17-ndt-12-2149) In association, specific deficits in a variety of PFC areas have been implicated in anhedonia ([Figure 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/figure/f2-ndt-12-2149/)).[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5003599/#b5-ndt-12-2149) ""

652,depression,Late Night Sadness,"So I’m currently sitting here crying because I’m realizing that I’m hurt. 
My life story is pretty long so I’ll just say what matters: my father left me when i was a kid. 
Years later, he tried to reconnect with me and that little girl inside of me was so excited. 
I finally get to know who my father really is.
When we met up things went well. Everything seemed great but then one day, he ghosted me. Again. 
Now before you ask me if i tried calling or texting him, why should I? 
This man has done this to me before so I’m stupid to think he wouldn’t again.
He’s married and has two kids that he takes very much good care of. 
I don’t even exist to him and it hurts. It hurts so bad and I’m tired of holding it in. 

I feel like i can’t speak to my mom about it because she has her father in her life. My cousins have their father in their life. My grandma had hers in her life until he passed. So it’s like nobody understands this pain. 
Plus, i don’t want my mom to feel like she did something wrong. 

I just wanted my dad to be in my life to maybe heal the parts of me that i needed to heal with him being gone for so many years .. and he lied to me and told me he was never gonna leave me again .. and he did that to me. 

All this is coming up because my birthday just passed and my dad was around last year (when we were supposedly building our relationship) and he was there for me to sing me happy birthday. Brought me cake and everything. It was everything i wish i had from him years ago for my other birthdays. 

Now he’s not going to walk me down the aisle , see me graduate college or meet my daughter like i was so hopeful for..

It’s breaking my heart. I don’t have anyone to talk to. I didn’t want to try to sleep with this on my chest.. but honestly idk. I just want to crawl into bed and never come out. 

I just want to disappear. How could the man who helped make me, not want anything to do with me?

It makes me realize that maybe no man will ever love me. Maybe they all will leave.. And that hurts. I don’t know what’s wrong with me..i wish things could’ve been different..

Im not able to sleep and i can’t stop crying."
653,depression,I mean nothing,"I'm a 17 yr old guy who has almost always had something to cause depression. Usually the causes sort themselves out or Ill realize that there was no reason to worry about it, but this one feels different because it isn't about an immediate problem. For the first two years of high school I was a really nervous person, scared of social encounters and really just a loser. My sophomore year I got kicked out of my friend group and it caused me to reevaluate who I was and I regained all the confidence I had lost before high school and now I'm a really popular person in my grade. But because for the first two years I was so awkward, I didn't join any extracurriculars or engage in any school related groups because I was too scared, and now it seems like it's too late to start. This causes me to feel like I'm severely behind everybody else, even if some people who are engaged with these groups are considered wildly less popular than me. I'm scared to start now as well because I feel like if i failed at whatever i tried i wouldn't be able to live it down for a really long time. I'm a really smart person, i've got perfect scores in some categories on the ACT and my overall score is paid scholarship level, but I'm worried because of my lack of extracurriculars colleges won't care about me and I'll have peaked in high school without having even done anything notable. I also feel like out of 8 billion people I'll be just another drop in the bucket, like I won't ever do anything good or achieve anything because what would be the point when there's billions of other people who could do the same thing. I have no idea how to stop feeling like this and it doesn't feel like it will end. What should i do? i hate feeling like this but i don't know how to explain it to anybody in my life who could help."
654,depression,Wish I could go back to years ago and do things differently,"If I could just go back to when I was living with my parents and call cps because of their abuse, finish school in a healthy environment, start learning to be patient with myself and accept and love myself earlier, start working on my social skills earlier, I would do it."
655,depression,I wish I didn't wake up today,"Great... It's morning again and I am sad that i woke up. I'm so tired of everything. Going there every single day, day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year.. A whole life based on misery, regrets, loneliness, shame, guilt, frustration, stress, being unlovable.. A life of traumas, a life of looking at your horrific past and hoping to go back to the constant bullying just because today it's much worse than just being bullied."
656,depression,Please try to save my life.,"



I can’t remember what my life was like before depression. All I can remember is this feeling. An emotionless, stuttering, insecure, anxious white knuckled 22 year old that is just getting by, barely, hour by hour. Day by day. It’s like survival mode. All I am focused on is getting through the day in one piece. Everyday is a test. There are 1000 ways to fail, or not live up to someone else’s standards. Failing is the only guarantee. I am starting to push away those that I love and those that care about me since I am unable to show my true emotions anymore. Nobody wants to put up with me. They are frustrate because I am withdrawn. Friends are slowly disappearing from my life, and slowly my family is too. I am nothing but a shell with nothing living inside. I see people laying on the floor crying of laughter, and Im over here trying to remember the last time I laughed. I have lost every bit of me that made me me. That made me happy. It’s all gone, and it’s not coming back anytime soon. If there really was someone out there watching, listening, and caring then I would have been rescued by now. Everyday I stare at a box cutter knife on my bedside, visualizing thrusting that knife and penetrating into my chest, into my heart, ending my suffering in seconds. At this point after all the medicines I’ve tried, all the therapy I’ve tried, all the dieting I’ve tried, all the exercise  I’ve tried, I have come to the conclusion that this is just how it’s gonna be. My insanely mentally ill brain. It’s like having a life sentence in prison. One day I will go through with the box cutter idealization .Once there is nothing left for me to say, nobody left for me to count on, and nothing to hold me back. Until then I will keep dragging myself  through these days until the timer runs out, and I can finally say I have had enough of this cold, cold world."

659,depression,throwaway rant - warning gross I’m sorry,"using a throwaway account because I’m incredibly embarrassed. my depression caught up to me again. the apartment was spotless, the dogs were on a routine and now it’s trashed again in the span of two weeks. this time there are maggots, a ton of them, just crawling all over my vanity chair. i sat a big takeaway tin container of food there a week ago and didn’t think anything of it and forgot about it. and now they’re everywhere. i got rid of the container but they were all under it, on the floor, and ants are carrying them away. Alive. and I’m so tired. everything hurts. My body, from sleeping for 12 hours at a time for the last four days, I’ve been off work, staying up all night scrolling Reddit because I also can’t sleep at the right time and I’m just so tired emotionally and mentally.

662,depression,Feeling Lost F/24,"Hello. I don’t really have anyone to talk to so here I am. To start off, I live with my mom and have never lived on my own. My brother who is in his 40s recently got out of a long relationship, got kicked out, and is now living with my mom and I on a mattress in the living room. He is an alcoholic and has had 2 seizures since living with us (about 2 years). I think he’s doing better now but it’s unclear if he’s still drinking or not since he’s so sneaky with it. Anyway, he doesn’t have a job nor cares to look for one. He sits there and plays video games all day and doesn’t have any concern for his life. He somehow gets poop on the toilet seat every time he uses it and I have to clean it every time. He doesn’t clean or do the dishes. 

I have been struggling to keep a job because I don’t have any motivation. When I get up in the morning all I see is my brother being a low life on the couch and it makes me not want to do anything. I recently got a job as a medical assistant but after two days I’m over it and realize I don’t want this career (I’ve held a job as an MA in the past but giving it a second chance now). So tomorrow I already have an interview lined up with a restaurant job. So basically, when I don’t have a job I feel like a loser and get stressed about how I’m going to pay my bills and when I do have a job I think “what the hell am I doing with my life?” because I’m the only one working in my household and have to deal with my stinky brother every day. Not to mention my boyfriend and I are taking a break because we don’t agree on things and that’s been hard on me. I feel like a lot of people my age have cool jobs and are making a lot of money and live on their own, but I on the other hand am stuck and I don’t know where to work, I don’t have the motivation to work, and I don’t know how I’m ever going to get out on my own let alone know what my passion is. All of this has caused me to question my existence. So I guess I’m just searching for a little motivation on this platform. Thanks"
663,depression,I don't want to live anymore,"I've been 34 years of pure shit.

And I don't want to be another minute alive.

I don't want to have to remember how I was beaten and humiliated as a child.

I don't want to have to remember to find that they had pissed on the walls of my house or my father's car.

I don't want to have to remember how I was scammed and tricked trying to have friends or be with people.

I do not want to have to remember all the pills that the psychologists forced me to take and that did not help me at all.

I don't want to remember all the panic attacks I've had, just thinking about having to leave the house or be around people.

664,depression,Dreaming,I had a dream about my mom. She passed when I was 17. I’m 20 now but I remember saying how this dream wasn’t real and I remember telling her how I was sad she left me and I was crying. She told me “I did?” Like she didn’t know she died. I told her she died and she told me that she’s always in my heart. I remember stop crying and we were at a restaurant. We usually had little dates where we’d go out n eat. But it was weird like lucid dreaming but idk I feel about it. I miss her everyday.

672,depression,a glass dome,"Depression is a glass dome. You are sitting in it. There's no way out. The oxygen is limited. You can breathe, but barely. You looked out. All 360 degrees you see. There's nothing in the way of your sight. And you stare at everything that is happening around you. 

You see your family. You see your friends. They are going about their lives.

You witnessed your best friend's wedding. You smiled and you felt the joy that everyone was experiencing together. 

You then watched another friend give birth. Oh! so cute, that little girl. or that little boy. That small little family looks so perfect and...whole. 

You look at yourself. In the glass dome. You smile. It's alright. You have everything you need and want for now. A happy marriage. Your own home. 

You watched as your friend's little one grow up. ""Aunty! look at me!"", the little one shouted from outside. You waved, you smiled. 

Then you heard a loud knock. Your best friend, your cousin, your friends. They all knocked on the glass dome and said ""look you! over here!"" They stand with their families. Their careers. Their travels. Their awards. Their recognitions. 

They waved and they started looking smaller and smaller. It's as though they were on a travellator, moving away at a constant pace. They became smaller and smaller. Their backs facing you, only with some heads turned, stretching their necks hard and far, so that they can catch the last glimpse of you.

And then you breathed. and realised that the air is limited. You looked out the glass dome. It is dark and empty. You tried to break out so that you can run after them. You hit the glass, you screamed, you threw things against it. And it cracked. but it did not break. 

You fell back onto the ground. You kept calling out for them. But it continued to stay dark...and quiet. 

And then, you are alone."
673,depression,Just a rant,"Can't sleep. Life's keeping me up. Basically, everyone throughout my life has been calling me a faggot. I had selective mutism in highschool. I couldn't talk. My dad growing up would make copious amounts of fun of me. That's the root cause of everything. I didn't learn to speak my parents language properly. My cousin's hate me. I didn't get to have fun in life. Life's come to a dead end. University won't get me employed. My neighbour, I still remember, said ""fuck you"" ""loner ass bitch"" and tried shooting me. I got made fun of on the bus. Fuck even is my life. Fucks even the point of this bullshit. Fuck my cousins. Fuck India. And fuck this midget of a rapist fuckass neighbour. Idek I'm such a disgrace I don't even feel like leaving my house and now I finally understand it all. The shit I should've been taught when I was younger but wasn't because I have a loser ass fucking family."
674,depression,I live and have lived such a pathetic and sad life,"I have no one to talk to, no where to go about this so I’ll dump this on you guys, hopefully that’s okay.

I try to live a good and fun life, and I have in the past but nothing is really fun anymore, and the fun I can have is pathetic and I’m lying to myself thinking I’m having a good time anymore. I just really miss my childhood, childhood friends and even highschool a little bit.

Highschool was the worst for me, I just graduated last year and as much as I’m truly glad to be out into the true world I regret a lot about it. Being surrounded by people and being antisocial, smoking my brains out making me even more stupid then I was before, only having 1 close friend those 3 years. I had all this opportunity and I wasted it. During high-school, after I graduated and now I barely had any true fun, I hate how I enjoy myself now and with other now, it’s just boring and a waste of time to me 

I moved 4 months ago across the country to start my career I’ve wanted sense I was 11 and as much as that makes me happy, I don’t have time to do anything. Everything has been stacked against me for what feels like a long time but lately it seems like I can’t catch a single break, not 1 thing that goes in my way so I can get 1 less thing off my brain. Oh these 10 things are in your way of accomplishing something that you have no control over? well we have a few more to add. That or one of those 10 things gets worst and worst, it’s unbelievable how stressful shit keeps getting.

That’s all I need is 1 little thing to take some weight off my shoulders, idk we’ll see how it goes hopefully something positive will happen eventually and I can use that to calm my head down.

Oh and a little thing, this job and especially my living situation is strictly no smoking or drinking. No smoking doesn’t bother me, but not being able to sit back and have a drink once a month is excessive IMO. I understand people binge drinking or drinking all the time and that being a problem, but I just want a drink to relax, take a load off and not have my sober mind to overthink everything. Especially after working my ass off these past 4 months and feeling like I’m getting no where. Is what it is

Thank you have a good night/day"
675,depression,Any new treatment options for Depression pop up in the last year or so? Any promising treatment options coming in the near future?,"Just curious. I haven't been in the mental health subreddits anywhere near as much as I was a few years ago. I (36/M) have tried about everything for depression over the past decade, and never found much relief. 

thanks!"
676,depression,Looking back on Past Experience,"I was a victim of Depression as-well, let me tell you something about it. It wasn’t a quick chilly Rain, No, It was a long hard winter that set off before I got a phone. It started the moment my parents undressed me naked and threw me out our apartment room for people to see. And why? Because I didn’t give the teacher my Homework. Although I didn’t understand then, But it sowed the seeds. You see, I would’ve actually killed myself if I didn’t have Social Media, In it I found friends, People who cared. People who every time I even mentioned self harm would talk me off the Ledge and then tell me that I *Mattered*. I’m grateful for those people. And on the other Hand, I went to see this piece of shit Therapist at a Hospital who devalued my feelings, didn't bother to listen to me, Mostly talked to my parents without me in the room (I AM THE PATIENT!) and was a general asshole. He was like ‘There have been 100s of people in that chair before you, So I know better and shut up’.  I still have some problems with it today but I’m proud of myself and thank Social Media. Sure, It can be destructive but Great aswell.

My parents still act like it didn’t matter.


Also, Asshole therapist should loose his license."
677,depression,Pain and sadness are the only things that feel real,"Sometimes I want to live without it, but even if I magically could cure my depression I would feel fake. This is who I am. I can run and I can hide as much as I want, I can fuck myself up with drugs as much as I want, but I can't escape the fact that I'll always be this depressed fucking mess of a human.

I don't know how it began, but I sure know how it ends."

679,depression,I don't know how the fuck I'm gonna survive the next few months,"So I'm currently in the process of redefining my relationship, I probably won't be able to find the strength to actually leave, but I'm not going to go without sex anymore. Probably more worryingly, we've become co-dependent, so we are staying together and have been staying together even when the relationship isn't working.

Ironically, as of the past few days I don't even want to fuck anymore, just as the opportunity is finally arising. So I've ruined my fucking relationship for no reason, great. That will probably change in a few days knowing me but who knows. 

I might just not be able to even think of sex without all of these fucking feelings coming back up, it's already happened to the point where I don't even really enjoy jerking off or porn anymore because of all of the negative feelings it conjures up.

My university counselor cancelled (I don't even fucking go to classes anymore beyond just doing the assignments) and it's in like 2 weeks, and I am going to see an actual psychologist (btw, what is the difference between psychologist and therapist?)  as well, but the wait list is probably going to be months. I seriously don't know how I'm going to deal with the stress of everything, no matter the outcome."
680,depression,It disturbs me that I can't be sane if I don't have a purpose,"That's all.  I give up.  All I want is to be content.  Monkey on my back, always.  Weight.. emotional stuff, damaging.. Now I'm a wasteland of possibilities ashed out washed up chunks of dead and dying oh yeah ..."
681,depression,How do people get up everyday knowing it's all pointless?,"I've recently adhered to the idea that nothing really matters since at the end of the day eventually the world will just stop existing. All the stuff we struggle for and worry about is small. I know we're supposed to make the best of it and enjoy what we have but I have nothing to really live for.

I wake up lie in bed for a few hours, go to work, come home shower, brush my teeth, find something to do for a while then get some sleep. Wake up and repeat. The only things I enjoy are eating and jerking off. I just kind of exist at this point.

I hate this shit so much."

684,depression,INEXPLICABLE,"The birds have travelled far and long
To hear me craft a perfect tune.
But a woman dressed in repulse and sly
Whispers me an insidious lullaby.
She paralysed me,made my vocals slurry.
And I collapsed, striking a single note
That echoed a monochrome so prosaic.
She lured in a entire town's fleas
Besides threatening my timid heart, wrapped in oblivion
And my whimsical black and white keys.

She sat and ripped out my senses
 Like petals of a rose
My clarity,my awareness,my sense of judgement and gratitude,everything froze.
She made me wear a blindfold 
That sat there on my skin till it infused,
Draping my vision and shutting the world out,
Leaving everything blurried and confused.
The sickness fed on my flesh and I craved to feel my face,
No prayer,no drug,no shrink could help me scrub it off my head.
Inch by inch,the poison had branched into my core that ached.

She tricked me into a room that smelled of rot and deceit.
The walls engulfed in chaotic grey mold
Enclosed each day by a feet.
The void of darkness and numb 
Was occassionally meddled with pain and sorrow.
Sometimes,like a saw slowly grinding back and forth on my body.
And on other times,like a sudden slash of an axe on my brain
Cracking it open and leaving me to drain.

My legs got rooted in the cold dead floor
And the spiteful air choked me.
I desperately hunted for a door.
I resorted to every possible distraction
I glued my useless eyes to a tiny neon screen 
And shoved my mouth with food I couldn't taste.
Please let me out of this disdain
To breathe again,think again,live again.

Finally I see your face,at the end of the tunnel.
But you ask me, 'Is it that unbearable?
You're just being weak and superficial.'
I collapse again with just a wonder 
Which part of this whole drama is hell.
My suffering? Or my inability to express it
To people I love the most?
Who point me at the culprit,as 'her'.
Who accuse me of an imaginary crime.
I realise I need to pay my cost 
Forming apologies to your countless blames
And garnishing explainations to your plates of gossips 
Throwing away my time to heal in flames.

It's a slippery slope
And I'm back at her feet
In the pit of depression and lifelessness
Where a million trains of thoughts crash against each other
Oh! What a massacre to watch!

It's a gigantic loop.
And I'm sick and tired 
Of being sick and tired.
I'd do anything to get out of it.
Yet I can't do anything to get out of it.
-Debangana Ray"

But I can’t. I can’t let my parents down like this. But that makes me feel even worse. They’re so kind and caring. I feel like shit. I want to give up. I feel so hopeless It makes me sick. I feel so empty I can’t even focus in school. I haven’t even done work in weeks. The antidepressants don’t work anymore. So what’s the point
686,depression,My psychiatrist slept with me then discarded me like trash. What shall I do?!,"I’ve been seeing this psychiatrist for months before she decided to ruin everything just to satisfy her needs.  It was my first ever psychiatrist and I was seeing her for my sever depression, anxiety, and PTSD.  She’s about 10 years older than I am with over 25 years of experience in this field. To be fair, initially i was benefiting from the sessions and things were heading in the right direction.  During all this, she was going through a divorce and her mind was all over the place.  Long story short, after a few months of seeing her, somehow I had a feeling that she’s into me but I ignored it because my mental health was my priority and the last thing I wanted was to cause myself even more harm by ruining my relationship with my doctor.  After months of trying to convince me to go out with her for a drink (her excuse was to observe how I behave in social settings) I agreed and went for it.  We both got a little tipsy and then she asked me if I wanted to have sex with her.  I agreed to it after a while and we booked a room and had sex a few times.  After that night she started telling me that she loves me and wanted to hang out again the following night to have sex.  I was hesitant at first but then went ahead with it.  I know I should’ve put a stop to it immediately but being very vulnerable and in such a messed up state of mind I wasn’t thinking and done what she wanted me to do.  She kept repeating the words “it’s ok you can trust me” the whole time but deep down I knew it was wrong.  After that night, I had an appointment with her a couple of days later and I decided to tell her how I felt and whatever is going on has to stop because I didn’t want to ruin the doctor-patient relationship with her and my mental health is my priority and it’s what I’m hear for.  She could tell how much it was bothering me and the amount of anxiety it was causing but she didn’t care and kept on trying.  I kept trying to explain to her that it is wrong and it’s affecting my progress but she didn’t cate about how I felt whatsoever.  Eventually she got the point and stopped but it came at a cost.  She didn’t care anymore about my mental health and her personality just changed towards me.  Basically, she neglected me and started treating me like trash.  It reached the point where I would text her that I’m suicidal and her reply would be “oh boy” and just ignore me.  Eventually i decided to leave her and look for another psychiatrist.  After this experience, I have a lot of resentment towards her and I’m consumed with anger because of her unprofessionalism and what she put me through.  I’m also angry about the fact that she knew how severe my mental illness was but she still put her needs first and actually today my condition is worse because of her.  Just FYI, I spent over USD 10k on treatment with her and this is what I got from supposedly the best psychiatrist in my country.  Today, my hatred towards her is extreme and a part of me can’t let go of the shit she put me through.  What shall I do?!"
687,depression,Can’t seem to get my life together despite having help with therapy and medication. More in body. Any insight will be helpful.,"Every time I pull myself out of my depression hole and start working on myself, something happens like a fight with SO and I regress instantly.

To elaborate, I’ve been in therapy and on meds which seem to help. My therapist is amazing and we have made lots of progress. I feel empowered after a session and have the desire to get my shit together but then some shit goes down irl and I regress into a dysfunctional ball of mass, incapable of doing anything. 


I cry too much, I stay in bed and my heat rate shoots up. I feel like my inability to handle a roadblock or a setback keeps in the depression loop. 

Does anyone have any insight to offer.

I’m on Quetiapine and sertraline and doing mentalisation based therapy after having done DBT in past. 

I am a smart person otherwise, with a masters in engineering and I feel like I’m wasting all my potential away. I oscillate between berating myself and pitying.

No matter how genuine I am, no matter how hard I try to be different, or change, they just stop responding randomly, slowly taking longer and longer, short responses...eventually people just leave, no matter how long we talk 

It doesn't matter what they say anymore, I've heard every promise, every ""I wouldn't do that"" variation, every ""I like talking to you"", 

Nothing but lies baiting me to make me feel good or something.

I'm tired, I'm so afraid of going back to the absolute silence of having literally zero people to go to, for anything...but at this point I literally just don't believe people or trust anyone about anything they say about me or our relationship.

I know nobody cares, nobody read this, and I'm just talking to myself...but it's not like I have anyone else.

I'm done, from now on I will just isolate myself again, no more believing people."
693,depression,Not sure how it gets better,This is my first time posting. I just don’t know how things will ever feel better in my life. I’m 26 and I hate myself. I cringe at everything I say and do. Any time I recall something embarrassing or painful I verbally say some variation of “I wish I was dead”. It’s literally become a reflex at this point. I don’t feel like I’ve accomplished anything and all I ever do is think about how great my life could have been if I had done it differently. I don’t want to die I just want a do-over. Every social situation makes me feel anxious. I stay home as often as I can. I don’t have any friends. Any friends that I did have dumped me years ago and never looked back. I don’t know if anyone outside my family has ever really cared about me. How am I supposed to like myself when no one else does? Doesn’t that make me a bad person? I just don’t see a way for this pain to ever go away. I have great parents who gave me a great life and so many other privileges. Do I even deserve to feel this way? Or am I just making excuses for being a lesser person?
694,depression,Give me shit if you will (much appreciated),"I'm a guy, who likes to lie that ""I can deal"", been single for 7 years, only reason I can be exact is that it is my son's age. She wasn't faithful, not her fault, I'm a shit and hard to deal with. But it kills me, talking to people, sure I can look attractive... but when I express myself, its always wrong. To be honest I don't  trust anyone. When people say we are friends, I find them to be okay acquaintances, to be a friend I'm giving you that part of me who wont forget you for years(a lie, I constantly remember you, at the cost of what memory I do have), even though we don't talk.... but to be honest, that's what it is, a memory. Not like I'll talk to them, I'm alone after all. To be clear, that is the level I experience for a simple ""friendship"", a ""relationship"" reaches 

I spend my time working, not in any way because I want to. But because I have to ""complete"" what I start. I hate this aspect of myself, because it gives off a ""false"" impression that I am good at my job. While the reality is that I'm the fucking worst, I have to take twice the time to complete a task that someone can do and maintain a 80% accuracy, there is no guarantee that my accuracy is that high. However the illusion is set with the details I provide, you think I'm better but I know I'm not. To be honest what hurts the most, is though no matter how dedicated I am to work it matters not, as it never gets me closer to the one thing I want. Sure every year I make more, sure I get more flexibility in my life, sure I can take care of myself better, sure I can own all my debts, sure I can look great on paper, but I could never have ""her"" , again I'm shit and working doesn't better that.

My son is the best and any time I get with him is worth all the 'suffering"" above, however. I'm trying to be negative here, so to tell you I have a positive in my life that ""greatly"" counters all of this, gives the fabricated sense that ""I can deal"". 

Side note, I am a pessimistic-optimistic, positive reinforcement has the opposite effect and makes me feel like you can't see the wrong. While a negative comment, will encourage me to understand the depth you have gone to acknowledge. That being said, I also don't feel anyone is wrong stating a clear thought they have even if it is negative, it holds the worth of true expression and should always be honored as such."

696,depression,Hi!,I have been dealing with depression for a very long time ! Whoever needs someone to talk to or just vent I’m here
697,depression,Hey all. I need a little advice.,"A little about me: I’m 18, turning 19 in 1 month from today. I am trans (MtF) and have been struggling with depression for many years now. 

So, I live with my parents, who do not accept me at all, I came out almost a year ago. They also refuse to take me to a doctor or therapist about my depression no matter how hard I insist because they think I’m faking it or I sometimes hear the “you don’t have anything to be depressed about” excuse. Also, where I live, you are not a legal adult until 19, meaning anything legal I do must be through my parents, I can’t take myself to the doctor and even if I could, I don’t have the money to pay. 
On top of this, my parents have been extremely…abusive to me my whole life. This has of course added on to the depression. 

I’m just wondering..what can I do? It’s gotten so bad lately where I have contemplated suicide more times than I would like to admit, and all I know is that something has to change and it has to happen soon. If anyone has any advice, thanks."

700,depression,NIACIN...holy shit the stuff works,"Idek how to describe the relief, how amazing it feels. But I started taking high doses of niacin, in the way Dr Abram Hoffer used to suggest for patients of depression and schizophrenia, and y'all it's night and day like when it kicks in I feel more connected to reality, I notice the beauty in things, I can feel pleasant sensations again, it's wild. And it's been happening so quickly the past few days it makes me think that I must've been really quite deficient"
701,depression,I'm still bothered by my childhood experiences,"Now to start my childhood wasn't horrible by any means but there isn't a lot I can look back on fondly either. I was bullied a lot for being ""different"" I guess? In the 4th grade I was diagnosed with depression, anxiety, and adhd. But before then I definitely had depression. I have a memories of praying to God to just end my suffering by any means necessary, thoughts of ending it all, and all of this before puberty. I felt so alone and lost. When kids should be ""making plans for the future"" I wasn't. I feel like I was robbed of an important step in life because of my depression. I still have a hard time dealing with people or trusting anyone after my grade school years. People would be nice to me one day then the next go back to treating me like garbage. I would often cry when stressed and would be teased. To this day I hate crying. The worst moment was after a former classmate passed away. Everyone was crying and comforting one another but I was still in shock and hadn't cried yet. When the meeting they had for the students had ended I started to cry. Immediately I was mocked for crying. By people who were crying not even a minute before. I am still disgusted by this. No matter what I did it was the wrong thing to do. I am an adult now and well old enough to have kids of my own... but these were my formative years. I spent them feeling miserable. Now I'm a depressed adult with no idea what to do with my life. I know I need to forgive and forget. I know I need to move on. I just don't know how."
702,depression,Is wrong for us to be loved?,"You know what? I have been thinking about this. It's my story. 

My ex got caught cheating with me. At first, he didn't admit that he cheated. He used his family as the reason for his deed. Fortunately, I got to know the truth thru his new girlfriend. 

I asked him what was the reason for leaving me? He didn't say anything to me at all. But he did tell to that girl. He says that he won't want to live a life with me, a depressed girl. Isn't it funny? He knows from the start of our relationship that I'm not okay. I got a miserable life. But I'm trying to be better. And he was okay with that. But now? So suddenly he changed. Using that pathetic excuse to guilt trap me. 

I depend too much on him. So when he chose to let go, my world just crumbled. He's my home. But he's gone. I'm lost. 

But I'm better now. I manage to go thru this all alone. No more skipping meals, no more cuts, no more headbanging, no more headache, no more self-hatred. I'm okay now. I did it by myself. 

Yes, I still love him. But I don't think I want him back in my life. I can't bring myself to look at him. Every time I hear about him, my hands start to shake and my breathing got heavy. It just, I don't hate him, but I hate how he left, how he treated me. He only apologises when he got caught. It's not even a sincere apology. 

To be honest, I wish you regret leaving me. I wish your life turn to hell from the second you betrayed me. I wish you suffered just like I did. I wish karma got back to you. And to her also. She fcking used me to dig about your secrets. But don't worry, your secrets are safe with me. I'm not like you. I'm better than you. 

You fcking tell her about my mental health? The secret that I keep by myself. I trusted you. But you told her. I don't even know her. I wish you two suffered."

704,depression,I feel empty and I don't know what to do with my life.,"I'm so so empty that I can't bear it. What should I do? Please help me! 
A year ago, I opened up to my parents that I wanted to suicide. All the problems that I had, my depression, my emptiness, trichotillomania, social anxiety and all, I opened up to them. It has been 5 years I have felt like this. Not wanting to wake up or to do anything, feeling hopeless because I couldn't see my future. A week ago, for the first time, I went to therapist because we had money problems before. He diagnosed me with depression, social anxiety and ADHD. He didn't do anything but gave me medicine and said to come after 3 weeks. I though I was going to have therapy. 

Even if I start doing things that I enjoyed, I can't enjoy that now at all. I try to change but this numbness won't go away. And I am in the 2nd year of my bachelor degree in business and I hate it so much. I went to the university after 1 gap year. I said to my parents that I don't want to do it but they insist saying don't waste your time and our money. You have to study no matter what. But I don't want to. That degree makes me feel even more worthless. I have already wasted their money and I don't want to waste more. I have no job and it's hard to get job here without working all day and I don't know if I can do it and I can't live without depending on them. So what do I do now? What do I even do if I drop out?"

709,depression,I don’t know how to keep doing this shit,"My life has been pretty fucked for a while now. Been stuck in deep depression for at least 3 years now, probably longer honestly. My childhood was fucked, my parents are both fucked, I’ve never really had friends or a girlfriend because I can’t relate to people, every job I’ve ever had has been fucked, I struggle to enjoy anything at all, I can’t remember the last time I went a full day without suicide crossing my mind at least once. And a couple days ago my sister, the only person on this planet I actually liked, died at only 25 years old.

I just feel like every chapter of my life has been me getting fucked over. Nothing’s ever just gone right for me. Every time I make a choice or a big life decision, it’s the wrong one. Every time I think I’ve lost everything I could possibly lose, I lose something else. Every time I think I feel as fucked up as I can possibly feel, life finds a way to make me feel worse. I just so fucking tired of getting kicked when I’m already so far down.

I’ve been in therapy for about 3 years now. Tried a bunch of different therapists. Been on so many fucking meds. None of it helps. My life is just completely fucked and I can’t keep doing this shit. I don’t even want anything outta life anymore, I’ve got fuck all to look forward to or be excited about. I don’t even know what *could* change at this point that would make any of it better, just feels like it’s been systematically demolished all the way down to the foundations and there’s just nothing fucking left here for me."

725,depression,i feel completely lost,"(tw: suicide and self-harm) i’m pretty sure i’ve had depression on and off since i started high school. i can clearly remember sitting in my youth group when i was 14 and imagining how i would kill myself and all i could ever think about was how much i hated myself. that’s also when i started cutting. but i was too scared to tell my parents because they’ve always seen me as the perfect child, so i never got any professional help. somehow despite all that i managed straight As throughout high school. probably due to the fact that it was the only thing that gave me any self-worth, if everything else about me was complete garbage at least i was smart right? wrong. now i’m in my second year of college. i cannot for the life of me focus on anything. i physically cannot work on my homework despite effort to try. i cant focus and i don’t care. fail all my classes whatever i don’t care anymore. now i can’t use my grades to boost my self-worth anymore, what’s even left of me? i don’t know what my parents will say or do if i fail all my classes. i don’t think my dad sees mental health as an excuse. i just can’t do it anymore. last summer was very traumatic for me and then in the fall i was so suicidal and depressed and now i just feel like a stale piece of bread sitting on a shelf. i just don’t care anymore and i’m so sick of all this. i just want to live but everything is weighing me down. i’m surprised i haven’t had a heart attack yet due to all the severe stress i’ve had the past 12 months. i really don’t know what to do anymore. maybe this is just a cry for help in a large void but if you’re listening thank you. please reach out to me if you’d like to talk because i could really really use someone to talk to right now"
726,depression,I feel like a fucking Zombie...,"I wake up feeling apathetic, tired and completely demotivated. Been trying to get my shit together for the past 3 months now, going in and out of sessions with my therapist, my psychiatrist and keeping up with my treatment... But it's ridiculously so fucking difficult. Some weeks just getting dressed is too much. 
I struggle to shower, to eat properly, to drink enough water, my self neglect is just making this more and more difficult. 
I've been trying non-stop to just DO, not thinking about how I feel because my therapist told me that once I get back into a rythme, things will be easier but I set traps for myself, self-sabotage and self-destructive behaviour such as drinking, self-neglect, self-harm are fucking me up. Though I realize these are due to past trauma and ways for me to ""cope"", i sometimes feel blind and walk aimlessly and slowly into one of these traps.
When I do, my inner demons whisper that it's easier to give in to the pain and wallow in my sadness. 
I make my sadness more intense through sad songs which helps me actually FEEL something. I'm slowly giving up, or have already... I don't even know why or how. My past is coming back to haunt me and I can't focus on recovery anymore. I don't want to fight. I want to give in. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for most of my life... Since a very young age and they've always fluctuated. I will not give up on life, I will not put my loved one's through the pain that accompanies suicide, though sometimes I get swallowed by those dark thoughts until they become poisonous. I don't know if I want to fight anymore, but giving in to that feeling only makes my guilt worse. I feel like a parasite... A waste of breathe, money, love and time. I'm in love with a man who is just absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. He's helped me a lot. Unfortunately, we parted ways somewhat due to life... He knows nothing of how I feel. I'm going to see him soon, he deserves love, care and happiness, not someone as pathetic as me... I don't even know why I'm writing this here as I usually lurk.

733,depression,I want to give up but I can’t,Ive been dealing with this for about 4-5 years and I’m tired of it. I miss having people to talk to and even if I make friends it my own fault that we stop talking. First it was when my friends went to other schools than I switched because of my depression and anxiety. I left everyone before saying anything I’m such a failure. So I went to a new school and made new friends but covid hit and we went remote. I couldn’t make it a full school week before being to freaked out and than I went online. That didn’t work. So I went to ANOTHER school. Sense I’m a fucking piece of shit it didn’t work. Because of me everyone I’ve known has left. And the fact I still have people with me and I feel this way. I’m such a greedy piece of shit. My best friend and I haven’t talked in a couple months. I wish I could give up but I can’t hell I’m not even done with school so how can I get a job. I can’t have friends how can I have a girlfriend or a wife. I just wanna give up but I can’t and the facts that I thought of killing my self I just can’t get this all out of my head. I can’t tell anyone cause if I tell my parents they’ll feel like there the problem (which there not there amazing) but if I tell my friends than they will say the basic things (yet again I understand) I can’t even escape my thoughts

736,depression,being stuck in past worsens my depression,"Whenever i kill the past and focus on the present to build to future i feel great , sorry I'm having hard time to express myself due my crippling depression but I'll do my best to explain it.

It's like whenever i say ""i wish i was like my old self right now"" ""i want to get my old self back"" it destroys me, it gives me so much anxiety and depression.

But whenever i think like my past self wasn't knowledge as i am right now i feel much better, like my old self wasn't knowledge as i am right now, but still he didn't have any mental issues and he used to love himself.

Like even tho i suffered severely from depression and anxiety atleast i learned so many new things and now I'm more knowledge about life. I was kinda closed minded in past , now I'm more open minded and learned so many new things about life and the world, i evolved so much.

Like if i realize and accept this i feel great cuz i don't fight to get my old self back anymore, i right to improve myself from the current situation by evolving even more.

It's like i need to destroy past and evolve to a better me and love my current self, don't you think that ?"
737,depression,How does employment affect your depression?,"I've been looking at it lately, and I feel like employment is honestly the source of my issues at this point.

The math of it being, if I'm up at 8am, and intend on being asleep by 12am, so I can get a solid 8 hours of sleep, and I'm not home til 7:30/8, basically 12 of my hours are accounted for. Four hours remain, but about 30/45 minutes of that is getting to bed/sleep. So there's like 3.5 hours remaining. And I should still eat. Which, is either cereal, or something else horrid for me, or I spend 30mn-1hr making something actually good, so I can be left with 2.5 hours remaining, and I'll probs take 10-30 minutes to eat it, depending on what it is. So as little as 2 hours ACTUALLY remain in my day after work.

Of course, I get more time to myself by neglecting myself. Most nights I'll ""go to bed"" and be doing anything else on my phone than sleeping because I just don't want to teleport back to work by closing my eyes.

Of course, there's 32 hours a week that aren't on working days, but working days are the worst. I may as well be dead. It'd be just as beneficial for me to stand outside in the street for twelve hours with my eyes closed. I'd get just as much value out of it. I'm just throwing my time away.

Though then again, maybe I'd get more out of that. I'm vitamin d deficient, so if I could get some time outside, that would be better, too."

740,depression,looking for help at the bottom of the barrel,"Hi, new to reddit but I'm not sure where else to look. I read over the rules and I’m trying to stay in the guidelines but apologies if I falter.

I was diagnosed with depression spring 2020. This was just the first time I saw a professional, I have been in what I like to refer to as a hole for much longer. I have shut myself off from my emotions and my peers. I never talk about my feelings, often it feels like my apathy is the only thing inside me. I am a university student but I am slowly but surely failing out. Everyday I wake up later than I want to wishing I didn’t wake up at all. I had a good childhood and outsiders would say I have a good life now but I have never been able to shake the constant feeling of emptiness. I do well socially and can achieve a goal if I want it bad enough and work hard enough. My problem is I don’t want anything and dont have the motivation to work. I just wish I didn’t exist, not to kill myself as I would ultimately hurt my loved ones more than help myself, but I wish I never existed in the first place. I am surrounded by my failures and hate the person staring back at me in the mirror. I feel I have the foundations to be the person I want to be but I don’t even know who that is. I want to rid myself of this burden, not through medication and therapy but through myself. I want to redefine who I am now to allow myself to become whoever I want. I've always been told I can do whatever I want and I know that I can, I just don’t want to be anyone. 

I’m looking for advice on how to better myself past the obvious google searches. I have tried therapy, medications, and lifestyle changes but nothing sticks. I don’t feel better talking on a couch about my feelings, taking an ssri everyday, or opening up to my loved ones. I want to fulfill my potential and will do most anything to get past the urge to stop hating every second of my life. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. If this isn’t the place to look a point in the right direction would be just as valuable"

745,depression,The hardest part about getting better is finding a reason to.,"The means to get better are easy to find (i.e. exercise, making friends, getting a hobby, therapy) but it’s just to simple for me to worm out of committing to them because I don’t care about getting better. 

My psychologist says maybe just trying to get better and THEN figuring out what I’m doing it for is the best solution but that sounds delusional.

Truly there is no reason for me to get better. It just isn’t there. I’m not at any stage in my life where anyone is really dependent on me. I am friendless. I wasn’t ever raped or abused so I have nobody to really “spite”. I’m kinda just a loser without reason. 

There isn’t really any reason for me to have a lust for my existence like most other people have. I just don’t value my life.

Sure, there are people I matter too but when I’m “gone” sure they’ll be sad for awhile but they’ll cope."

752,depression,looking for advice on saving money,"I have depression, anxiety, and ADHD. This combination makes a really difficult to save money. I struggled to just get a job for years. I'm 27, going on 28, and live at home with my parents. I had a job and just quit that job for a better one. The pay is about the same but with a fraction of the physical and mental stress. 

I feel better with this new job. The last one was kicking my ass. Again, physically and mentally. But that doesn't mean I don't still have depression and ADHD. I spend a lot of money, and most of it on things that are NOT necessities. 

I want to really start saving money though, while I don't ha e bills to pay, or rent, or any of that. It's the smart thing to do, but I am really struggling. I set up a savings account that takes 100$ from every paycheck I get, so a little bit of a cushion is starting to build there, but I'm still spending way too much money on a weekly basis. 

So, I'm just looking for other suggestions on how to save money and cope with this stuff more. I spend to make myself feel better with new stuff. Even though I know it won't help me in the long run. 

So, advice is welcome."

754,depression,"may have dated a pedo, don't think meds are going to help","my ex boyfriend became emotionally, then physically abusive. i caught him looking at pictures of young girls. have not gone through puberty young. i had always believed it was due to a mental health issue, but now i don't know.  i tried to help him.  he  stopped taking any medication, except Adderall, and stopped seeing a therapist.  

i cant stand myself anymore. i called a suicide hotline one night, when i told them i had started self harming again, and was embarrassed, they replied ""oh at your age, that is embarrassing.""

 lets just say i don't think i will be ready for bikini season.  unless i wear one of those bikini bottoms with the skirt thing. i keep it to the upper thighs. 

i have been seeing a shrink, a therapist, and found a recovery from  domestic violence group. 

my shrink has added on different medications, but i don't think there is a pill in the world that can make me feel okay. sometimes i vomit when i get really anxious.  this is the first time in my life i have had a scale, because im trying to gain weight. What he was looking at makes me afraid that anyone who finds me attractive, is attracted to the same kind of thing he was. 

i feel like a lot of people don't believe me.... about the CP,  and  the abuse. How he behaved  when other people were around vs when we were alone,  was very different. It kind of made it hurt more seeing how nice he was to other people, but would just pretend like i didn't exist, or worse when we were alone.

i had already struggled with depression and anxiety, and that's the way i had met him, an online support group. 

Now, i hate leaving my house.  i hate how i look. i don't like being around people. i stay away from social media. i told some of the prominent social media people that are associating with him . i shouldn't have, because everyone thinks he's amazing and i'm just a crazy ex. Even though i have known him for at least 5 years, lived with him for 2 years. They have known him just over the internet for a few months. 

i did report what i saw to the relevant authorities, but  i think he's too smart to get caught. 

There was an an open investigation on him a few years ago, one reason was due to the CP. 

TL;DR 

i dated and cohabitated someone who may have been a pedo (caught him looking at naked little girls), i hate myself for it. i dont leave my house most days. A lot of people don't believe me. They think hes a great person, and im a crazy cunt.  im not suicidal, but i keep hoping i just die in my sleep."

769,depression,I'm too young for this thing called depression.,"So I'm 16 years old and I think I've had depression for atleast over a year but I don't want to go see someone about it because I don't want my parents and other family to worry about me right now.

My dad has recently been putting pressure on me to get an apprenticeship(An apprenticeship is like a job and school combined, you train for a number of years for it) for panel beating (which is repairing dents in transport) and it's been pushing me further into darkness and I haven't a clue what I want to do after I leave school rather it be this year or next. I'm afraid that I'm gonna be 25 with no job still living with my parents.

Before this I went through a faze where I would barely talk to any of my friends at and after school. They put the pieces of the puzzle together, and they would all tell me that life would get better and that that'd hope I feel better. They try force me to go to the school counselor which I don't want because they notfiy my parents about it and then I'll put pressure on them when they work their asses off for me and I feel so ungrateful because I show barely any emotions anymore. Even before that faze I was bullied because I was the ""pussy"" and the ""waste of oxygen"" at school and alot of people hated and still hate me.

5 or so years ago I was such a cheerful young boy that would get along with everything and everything I would draw cool little pictures and give them to my friends and family, but now I don't have any energy to do anything anymore. All I do is go to school, sleep in most of my classes, come home and lie in my bed and scroll through some social media till I cry myself to sleep which would be around 11 then wake up the next day at 7 and go to school. 

I feel so empty inside all the time and just of late I somehow got a crush on this really nice and cool girl at school, so I plucked up the courage to ask her out but she sadly rejected me.

I want to end it all right now, I feel like theirs nothing and nobody in this world for me even though so many people care about me. And I honestly don't want them to care so much because theres nothing special about me at all.

I congratulate you if you've read all this thank you for your time. Please older people please tell me it will get better"
770,depression,How do I help someone with a different kind of depression?,"People react differently to stress. Me? (F21) Im the sensitive empath. I cry a lot, I don’t want to go out, I isolate myself, I feel like I’m an inconvenience &amp; no one loves me like I love them. My friend? (M26) Is the angry asshole. He gets so mad at himself, is annoyed with everyone, ignores all his problems &amp; possible solutions. I love him &amp; care about him very much &amp; at our core, we have the same feelings, we just express them differently. I’m dealing with my own issues but I am always willing to help other bc I don’t wish this on anyone. Making others feel better makes me feel better. It’s a win-win. However, all of us in this subreddit know that people that don’t help themselves &amp; don’t want to be helped, cannot be helped. So obv, nothing I do will help unless he lets it &amp; ofc, he’s not. He basically hates everything right now. He wants to call me but he doesn’t want me to talk bc he gets frustrated bc he’s in the “nothing matters” mindset &amp; he doesn’t have anything to say &amp; he also doesn’t want to hang around anyone. I can’t say anything without getting cut off with a snappy response. I am very patient but I also need to have respect for myself &amp; I need to be respected by others. I tend to let people walk all over me bc im too caring &amp; empathetic. How do I set boundaries in this situation but still let him know that I am always willing to help if he allows me to? He’s very hot &amp; cold with this bc he’s fine when he’s calm but as soon as he’s overwhelmed he gets extremely irritable/rude. I can’t allow that but I also understand. Any advice? :/"

it’s really hard to explain but i never feel comfortable in my skin i constantly feel intrusive thoughts and a general desire to not want to exist. it’s not really a typical depressed or anxious feeling as i’m used to, more a weird and uncomfortable feeling of despair and confusion. it makes me not want to exist anymore because it’s so uncomfortable and confuses me so much on if what i’m thinking is right or not and why i feel so freaked out by things once normal to me.

please if you have any advice lmk, i’m getting desperate because i hate this feeling so much, feel like i’m going crazy"

I then stopped getting the monthly phone calls out of nowhere (seemingly unrelated to my 18th birthday) and then randomly got a call from a doctor at camhs (not the adult services) (not a therapist) who said she was putting me on medication. Ok, fine. I still didn't get any check in calls. I got one to see how the medication was doing and refill my prescription when it was running out. The other day I got my first call from them in a couple months. It was the doctor telling me I'm being discharged from their services. After the other woman told me they had accepted me.

790,depression,I turn 30 tomorrow. Thinking back on my twenties.,"I have suffered from mental illness my whole life. But depression particularly since my teens.

Looking back on the last decade, I think the biggest theme has been loss of hope. I had one girlfriend in the last decade. And I do miss her. I miss having someone to talk and laugh with. Someone who smiled at me like I was special and important. I miss driving from my university to hers on Fridays and spending time with her before taking her back home for the weekend. I miss intimacy. I miss her family. I miss her house. I miss going to restaurants and taking vacations with them.

But I think what I miss the most is feeling hope. I used to believe, even at my darkest moments, that things could get better. Depression is what ended the relationship, and in the 6 years since then, I've stopped believing things can be better.

For more than year video games were the only thing that I was enjoying, but that just also passed.

But to others here: Do you guys have any tips for me in college? Two years of letting everything slide in my masters has caused a lot of problems. So it is difficult to take the exam because the module is not offered this semester. In addition, how do I explain to the research group where I want to write my master's thesis why it took me two years longer to complete my previous studies? Somehow it is still hard for me to tell others about it."

795,depression,My story,"Hi, I dont know if this is a place for this but I wanted to give it a shot.

Im 18, young and I have a bright future. When I was 11/12, I was abruptly told my mother collapsed and was rushed to the hospital. I was told this the day I was to present what I had worked on at a summer camp, to my parents. Still haven't to this day. After the many tests and such that you go through, we were told she has lung and brain tumors. She had very little time to live. My father used every tool at his disposal, nothing was going to stop him from doing everything he could. During this time he also worked, and he found great success in a field usually hard to find that in, and because of that he managed to grant my family the means to a comfortable life, not much to worry about. He did this to protect my mom, me and my family. We were stripped of our childhood at a time when I should have been in school, playing with friends, and experiencing my youth. I never got that. After her surgeries, and many drugs including what I believe was chemo, she stabilized and eventually it went into recession. This uncertain but thankful peace lasted for another 6 years, but what it did to me at least ruined my life. Rather than do my schoolwork, I slacked off, nothing mattered if I could lose what was important to me in an instance. I never came out of this and by the end of highschool, I didnt really have a path or interests. I started college this year, and despite her being in good health, I decided to try. I spent more time focusing on my work, and got the best grades ive had in years. I made great friends, and loved what I was doing. Come winter break, it started again. This time, she was diagnosed with Leptomeningeal metastases. There is no cure. Nothing you can do but prolong it and try to give them a comfortable life. One of her only wishes is for me to enjoy college, but I cant knowing any day ill get a call that she is in the hospital again, or dead. I would be considered a very fortunate person. I dont have to worry about money, ever. My family is considered very rich, in the eyes of others, and they're not wrong. People see me for what others have accomplished, and consider me disappointing (not my parents to clarify). Everyone assumes my life is great because im rolling in it. They assume my family doesn't deserve it, that im spoiled. Why do I have to be punished like this. Why does the success from genuine hard work, that cost time with my father, have to mean we didn't deserve it. People assume I am happy because I can have anything and everything, to a certain extent. People never ask what I really want, and it cant be bought with money, no matter how many millions you throw at it, I just want my childhood. I just want my mom to be safe. One day when I walk to get my diploma, walk to certify my marriage, get my first job, buy my first house, have kids, I wont be able to share that with the most important person in my life.

Its always about the money, to those who dont have any. When in reality, the money is as worthless as the cotton it is printed on.

So for those who always ask, if money is such a blessing and buys you happiness. No. No amount of money will ever satisfy you, it only generates momentary happiness, the relief of not having to worry about rent, food, things no person should struggle for. However it makes you feel more helpless when you realize money can never beat nature.

I dont want pity. I dont want to be told it'll be ok. But nobody has ever told me none of the other stuff mattered. Because no matter who sees it, ill always have an advantage others dont and that is all that matters when putting me next to someone in a similar situation, with the only difference being the money. The priceless moments the average person gets to experience, that I missed, can never be replaced by money. So the next time you have a normal family meal, get tucked into bed, get to go on vacations with your family. Remember, that is more than money. That is life.

To those who are considering ending things, or hate themselves or their lives. Take a second to think about things. Nobody is perfect, nobody said living was fun. But find the fun between the hard shit. And look at that as a reward for putting up with the rest. When life hits you down, hit back up, and realize you can one day look down at where you used to be, and loving where you are now. We each have a purpose in life, and that purpose isnt to work or to make something, but a purpose to take care of ourselves and cherish the life that we have been given, because a truly perfect life is a life without adventure. In the end I know things will be ok for me. After all the tears are shed, and after the dust settles, ill need to provide for someone else, and that person is me. Nothing is promised in life, so live it like that exactly, and no matter what you have, work so you have more of it.

796,depression,"A weird feeling, wondering if it could be related to depression?","So I’m (F18) in the process to get help but I might have to wait up to a month to get to see a psy. There is something that is happening more and more and is very distressing. I remember it happening even before my 11th birthday. It seems like not everyone experience this(I used to think it was as common as a simple headache). In fact, almost everyone gives me concerned looks when I talk about it. I can’t even find informations online. 
If anyone ever lived this i would love to know

So

It happens most of the time Around people I am attached to, or comfortable around, or in a safe situation

Suddenly I feel really uneasy around them or within myself. On some occasions, its as if my body needs to hide. 

The feeling last from 1 to 10~ seconds. Like a big peak in the beginning

Then it make me really scared because i don’t understand whats happening and i feel incredibly disconnected from everyone

I feel the urge to be alone in my safe place (my bed)

The fear doesnt leave, it only brings more 
Such as ""what is wrong with me, who are they really""

The fear slowly calms down, lasting for max 1h and everything slowly goes back to normal. 

I remember rare times it was so huge. Those moments are very short lasting, but make me feel so terrible it’s almost panic-like. I feel incredibly wrong deep in my chest. It is so intense i can only pay attention to that. It is so disturbing.

Thanks"
797,depression,How do I keep on going when there’s no point?,"like I’m 19 going on 20 and I have no skills whatsoever, everyday my brain feels like it’s getting dumber and dumber, every time one of my parents or tios or tias or cousins talk to me about the future (working or school) I just get filled with this existential crisis/anxiety that just makes me want to end it all  and it makes me feel so guilty because I have no reason to be depressed or want to be dead, I have both my parents and family that love and support me and I have a good living situation going on but I still wake up wanting to be dead

I just can’t see a future for myself like I won’t drive because every time I get behind the wheel I just have visions of myself crashing or injuring someone and I don’t want to hurt anybody, I just want to be dead and have it so that no one feels hurt by my passing 

I know it’s not a big thing and it’s something that everyone has to do eventually but I’m just so nervous to get a job and be an adult because I still feel like that little kid that I was in elementary and I feel like I disappoint my family everyday"

Anyways but ive heard about something called brain fog and it can be a symptom of depression, im not too sure what it is but ive been affected by it, i can barely hold a conversation anymore and its really hard to think and i forget very easily, and honestly im just so damn tired of life, ive been watching a lot of philosophy videos on youtube to help overcome anxiety and all that but honestly in the end... after all this struggle and pain and hardship, im just gonna die like everyone else :(, which is a bit unmotivating but only cowards think like that, im going to enlist to join the police service and hopefully become a police officer

Things are tough right now as im extremely poor and my family's house is about to get taken away by the bank, my dad's fault but it is what it is, i just wanna move out of here so badlu because everyone here are just narcisstic and just they ruin my mood whenever im slightly happy, i feel empty and im coming to terms with it, i dont wanna fight it, i wanna embrace it and learn to live with it

Anyways im just rambling and i lost focus but anyways just using here as a diary of some sort for when i look back in the future, im 18 right now future me and i hope you're doing better, keep going, pain is temporary"

He’s gone to hospital and has blamed me. I am suicidal but there’s nothing In this house that could kill me. I don’t know what to do anymore, my life is like a time loop I can’t escape from.

Many past lovers that disappeared like a ghost. I moved to Alaska believing I was called here by god himself but I’ve been battling homelessness, unemployment, police and crooked people. You know how life goes… I am doing everything in my power to destroy myself I am wise I am disciplined and have had a very long journey each day I wake up believing I exist for a reason I’m sacrificing my life in every way. I lost everything and I live in the back of my truck trespassing a condominium complex I can’t get a job I’ve had so many and humans have failed me more than I can count. All I ever wanted was love but God won’t let me live in the world anymore everything I once was is gone every desire every ambition every passion and goal and I blame God for killing my ego but leaving me in the den of wolves to fend my life their are so many ways my life can fall and crumble right before my feet I’ve had to steal to make money or feed myself I’m not worried about the sin because as god wills right? I really long for death and every day I was I find myself look my for it. Whatever you want to believe either earth is paradise or purgatory and I am giving up God rather let me sin and suffer then deliver me and save me. I’m thinking about setting flames to everything I own completely in my truck and watching it burn while I wait and watch it burn while the police and fire show up it doesn’t matter anyways because one way or another I am going to lose I think setting fire to everything that I am would be the best form of atonement and allow me to start at rock bottom and at least I won’t be killing myself. ~The light of the world"

810,depression,How did you find self-compassion?,"I'm struggling to learn how to value my needs like how I value those around me. When I'm alone I feel completely useless and I think things that I know I don't really feel. I have plenty of things that I need to be doing for myself, but I don't. It's like my brain is always working against me and I have to constantly distract myself to avoid this haze-like feeling. I've been working insane hours lately, which only leaves time in the day for work and proper sleep. Except I'm only sleeping 2 hours a day and I've barely eaten in a week. I know it's not sustainable, and I have no reason to be doing any of it. If you asked anybody in my life if I was depressed they would say no, I'm a pretty happy guy.   I kind of wonder when everything will fall apart"
811,depression,Sheesh,I don’t like who I am. I’m probably one of the most introverted person I know. And people get annoyed for how introverted I am. Is it really my fault that I don’t like people nor do i want to talk to them. I don’t understand how you can get mad at me for not wanting to spend 3 hours talking with a group of people. You’re lucky to have me talk for 15 minutes. People love me. People enjoy having me around. People find me charming and funny. It’s gonna be crazy when people find out i’m gone. Some say it’s selfish. Sometimes you gotta be selfish to be happy. What is selfish is keeping whats making someone feel free away from them. I wanna be free. I want a care free existence. No more worrying. No more people. Let me smoke my cigarettes in peace.
812,depression,Fuck it.... I guess,"I don't know if I can do this anymore... for the last two years I've been in a deep spiral downwards. I've lost my job, friends, and the love of my life. Most of it was out of my control, but no matter how I try to come to terms with it it seems impossible. I'm not the type of person to delve into the ""Woe is me mindset"" and I understand that I have to make an effort. I have. It just seems every time I do the high of happiness subsides within a matter of a few weeks. I've tried reaching out and repairing myself but it hasn't worked. I've spent countless hours forcing myself to leave my room in order to meet people. I've tried online dating, which ironically I promised myself I'd never do. The only happiness I can ever seem to accumulate is always from false hopes in my head telling myself ""It's going to get better"" only for it to fall completely apart in a short time after. The scariest part about it to me is the fact I know Im a strong person and yet I seem to fall short no matter how hard I try. These past couple of weeks have been the worst. I'm on the verge of losing an important job I love because I cant find the motivation to get out of bed in the morning. I feel further away from everything and everyone more than ever. I feel like I'm at my snapping point. The only reason I'm writing this here is because I just needed an output. I don't want any more false hope from myself, family, or others. I don't care anymore, maybe I just wasn't built for any of whatever this is. I'm only 19 but the thought of this dragging on any further makes me want to end it here and now. I just want a hug from someone that I love, a reassurance from an old friend, hell I'd even take someone that could just make me smile for the first time since I can remember. I don't even know what I'm doing or who I am anymore. As much as I want to die, I can't even muster the strength to end it. Writing this was probably a mistake but it's granted me a distraction for the last 10 minutes so fuck it. If you read this far I appreciate it. I think I'm just gonna go lie down now and wish I never wake up."

I pretend like I'm okay and I'm a good actress. I'm not sure what to do other than to kill myself. I have -$250 and the number just keeps going up. My last job fired me because I couldn't keep up with the physical demands and I wasn't good enough. My parents have disowned me and there is nothing left. I've failed at everything and I'm not sure what to do. The only way out that I can see is literally selling myself.

I feel ashamed about the money I am spending and ashamed these simple tasks feel so difficult at the moment.

 This seems like a silly question but what are you go to meals that are somewhat nourishing and easy. I almost feel like the first step forward is to just rotate between a few things until I feel more like myself. So far all I can think of is yogurt, oatmeal and bagged salad."

I dragged my battered body into the vehicle and took myself to hospital. 

There, I showed up at the emergency department, covered in blood and bruises. 

A doctor asked, “What seems to be the problem, sir?” I had to explain to him, in great detail, exactly what my injuries were, and convince him that they were real. 

He warmly congratulated me for seeking help. Then he handed me a first-aid kit, left an after-dinner mint on my pillow, and went home.

At the most vulnerable, confusing moments in our lives, public health messaging encourages us to ring helplines or visit our doctors. I believed that if I waved a white flag, someone would ride in on a white horse and carry me to safety.

I would even preview upcoming topics and pre plan my jokes to be said during then.

Now class is depressing as fuck. I just fall asleep lonely. My best friend in school moved last year. Honestly the boys are pretty ass. I miss her a lot. I don't have friends in school. I'm a weird kid. I don't listen to mainstream music, I don't play a whole lot of video games. I hate sports generally and I just spend my free time reading sheet music that I brought with me.

831,depression,I need some help,"Hello, fellow teens

I am currently living in a rough situation. In my current household, I live with my parents and brother. I want your opinion on what i should do , or if I am right or wrong.  I live in a middle-class household so money is not a problem here. I have arguments with my parents and usually, I think I am right. The following argument is what has happened, but take some of them with a little grain of salt

scenario one: I don't really like people touching my stuff(I don't think it is related to ocd but more on the side that I known where everything is in my room and from past experience my mother has damaged those items I had). I have told my mother multiple time not to clean up my room. In this past week, my room has gotten a little messy and i got told to clean it up. I have agreed to clean it up. During the week I got a heavy-workload from school assignment and test coming up at the end. So like every other teen out there I worked very hard on them. Due to the event of working on school i stayed up very late and had no time to clean up my room. After my mother sees that I haven't cleaned up my room she decides to clean it up even when I told her not to muliple times beforehand. This is mainly due to her breaking my office pc last time. For the past months I felt lonely afterwards because video games are my only stress reliver at the moment. Anyways when I came back from school( I walk to school and back from school) I find out she cleaned out my room while I was away. I immently freaked out because Some of my stuff is missing. he saids it is not a big deal but I am missing items that were there beforehand or otherwise they had been damaged. This is not the frist time this has happened before. Once she tried to move my pc and it stopped working( this was mention above). Anyways I have lot of damaged items and missing one from the outcome of her actions. My mother also sell this clothing that make your skinner but I think the group is.pyramid sceme because it recruits more people( If you live in markham ares then don't but the product it gives no benefites. Anyways she starts to leave everyday for  the whole day and comeback at 8 to 9 in the evening. Once when I was sleping she came back home and ring the bell. I of course didn't hear and later when she got into the house guess who got yelled at for not opened the door after she party all day with her flirty work friends?

scenario 2: In my household I get blamed for everything. Yes, i know the older sibling usually gets blamed for stuff but when I mean everything I mean everything. My dad would not even question if something was done with my brother but instead go straight to be and proceeds to yell at me. An example of this is when he find out his t shirts are missing but goes to me and complains that i have taken them. After he proceeds to yell at me for about 3 mintuies but brother comes along and admitts he took his t-shirt. What makes me so saltly if that he get away with everything. Whenever my brother get in trouble it is away told to him not yelled and screamed at. He would always get off the hook with a warning while I always get yelled at and then he compain for the rest of the day of how bad of a son i am. That I am a waste of money and a piece of trash. I really don't think this is a good way to parent your kids. My father had always had an anger issue with him. For example when I was growning up whenever I did something wrong (yes I do attmitted I did some things that were clearly in the wrong but I was young at the age of 8-10) he would smash something I valued. An example of this would be a lego set or my macbook air . I would ask my father ahs anger issue because of the things mentioned above. I never got everything I wanted unlike my brother. Whenever my brother asked for something he always got it. While I can't get anything. I am not allowed to get another pc because my mother distoryed the one I had beforehand. Since I live in a place where I connect with people online ,it been a really rought few months. If anyone has any suggestion on how to make money as a teen plz put it down below! Since my dad dosen't ask question about what happeneds. Whenever I have a fight with my mom, he always defends my mom. My mother side of the story would always make her look the best. An example of this would be me taking a shower. When I take a shower and I see take my towel if not there afterwards( I had to walk to my room to get something to dry myself). while in the process I made a trail of water. My mother immdatiey notices and then compains to my father. I agreed to mope it up. I got in for less then 5 seconds and mom brustes in. When doing so I tell her to leave so I can clean it up. She then starts to compain about how there water but she was the one to take my towel in the frist place. I think taking my towel without warning takes some of the blame on her. So I close the door but the devil of a bitch throws the door open with the speed of a crackhead on the loose. That it hits my toe and a piece breaks off the door. She then calls my dad over and this bitch had the courage to say "" look at this useful son, all he does is ruin our house"". ""he made our floors wet( dosen't mention the towel that was taken for me). She then sayes("" he broke a piece of the door""). No, you insane son of a bitch you broke it in your dumbass trying to come in for no reasons at all. When I said I will go mope the floors.

Scenario 3:

My brother is a spoiled brat. He would brother me at all cost because he knows that my dad and mom would be on his side no matter the reason. I could be sitting in any other room in our house and this brother of mines would come up and hit me. Not just that, I have noticed to not trust him ever! This mans snitches if he get a treat out of it. You cannot trust this him. This man is so spoiled by my parents that he get everything he wants, when he want a coach bag he got one. I get one pillow that is not good(so i asked my mom for one good one) she rejects and then give him two really good ones. This mans doesn't do his schoolwork so last year he didn't even get a mark on his report card. My mom would be proud of him even thought I got 85-95 mark last year. Since she dosen't care about marks anymore, my grades started to slip this year. When he gets home all he does is watch youtube videos and when I am caught on my computer usually doing schoolwork , my parents compain about me still. Even if i have not left my room all day I still hear then complain about me because I am always the one to get blamed. I don't think I can stand this much longer.Everyday I live here has been a nightmare. My grades are slipping now so I don't know what to even do. I can't deal with this work enviroment when I get home for a tired day at home. I need some suggestion to what to do to improve my living situation. Plz don't joke about this I think I am getting depressed! I don't have video games to cheer me up, I have very limited friends nowdays, I get blamed with everything in the household, and my brother is a spoild brat. I think I might have depression because of this. If there anything that could help?"
832,depression,It helps to see other people Happy,"I’ve been in this depressive state for along time. I’m not sure I understand why but for some reason it just feels good to see other people Happy or enjoying life. Even though I feel as if my whole world is burning down, it’s awesome to see friends and family doing good. Not sure what this means but i fear it means I no longer care about myself, or that I care more about others."
833,depression,Sexual Abuse,"I'm writing this with the last ounce of life left in me .

&amp;#x200B;

If you have suffered from sexual abuse you need to talk to someone about it as soon as possible before the trauma energy associated with feeling sexually abused consumes you.

&amp;#x200B;

I got molested on my 12th birthday and got jumped the next day for being a fag that sucked dick, it took me 10 years to snap out of that beating and realize i'm not gay and I got sexually abused. 

&amp;#x200B;

The damage was already done and within years of being sexually abused, I sexually was innapropriate with my family and got labelled a sex offender or a pedophile, that has haunted me for my entire life and i have never been able to become a person. 

this year I apologized to my family for my actions in my youth and I finally told my family for the first time since incident that I was infact molested and almost sodomized on my 12th birthday party sleepover.

&amp;#x200B;

My life is stolen and robbed to trauma and i'll never be the same kid again. I dont want to carry on living.

if this posts seems similar to anyone, please apologize for your actions and face them before you spend the rest of your life thinking youre a sexual predator when it was your trauma that introduced those intrusive thoughts into your mind. I dont know what to say anymore, I feel demonic and no one thought to ask me if i was sexually abused as a kid. I notice the demons in my mind, I'm still fighting intrusive thoughts, anytime the world pedophile comes up I immediately get red flashes and I feel sick even though that word is far from me, its a part of my abuse."
834,depression,I really don’t know what to do anymore.,"I feel like I’m stuck. Or like something is missing, I keep trying to better myself and be better for the people around me. I keep having suicidal thoughts and I’ve been on and off medicine after medicine, I recently got prescribed adhd medication by my psychiatrist and it just feels like I have more motive to do stuff, but also more Motivation to finally end it, after spending 6-7 years of struggling with depression and it’s been up and down but it always comes back to the suicidal thoughts and I just want it to stop. I’m sorry if I don’t make sense or I’m rambling I’m trying hard to explain. I just want someone to tell me what the fuck Is wrong with me, therapy just stops working, and I have a bunch to be happy about but sometimes none of it matters, no one matters, I’m tired of feeling like I have to be saved, I tried working out and I’ve been pretty successful, but it’s not enough, I know how to play 3 instruments and it’s not enough, I have support. But it’s not enough. I wanna start a career but I just tell myself “what’s the point” I have little moments of bliss and honestly they keep me around, but I guess I feel like no one could ever love me because of this, the constant self doubt, the flippy-floppiness with my emotions, I try to avoid the constant pain and suffering, and I’m really trying to be happy I am, I love seeing other people around me happy, and it gives me life. But I also can’t help but feel envy and shame. Why is it so easy for everyone else to be slightly okay. I don’t know. Rant over"

836,depression,The worst thing about depression for me,"Depression itself is awful. Everybody talks about that. 

But nobody talks much about what to do if you don't think you can take care of yourself anymore. Why aren't more people worried about that? Are homelessness and suicide the only options? I don't actually want to kill myself but am so worried I might have to. There isn't really anyone I can trust or depend on. I don't understand why there aren't more posts about this. Being miserable in bed or on the couch for periods is awful. Sadness is awful. But losing everything is unbearable. Losing home, family, friends, looks, all your money and savings. No career. I don't see how one can recover."
837,depression,I've failed.,"At this point, it seems like the depression might as well just win. 

I've been trying so hard to improve myself amidst difficult circumstances and mental health issues. 

Whether it's regular therapy, medication, exercise, socialising, hanging out with my dog, it just doesn't seem to be working. 

I even managed to snag a higher paying job that I've been dreaming about but it's still so hard to get out of bed and stop crying. 

I feel like everyone hates me. 

My partner laughs at my sadness. When I confided in my family member about it, they suggested I remind him what it's like when I'm happy. 

I can't. I get that people get sick of you being sad. HELL. I'm sick of being sad. 

I don't know where I'm going with this. I just feel worthless and defeated and I don't know how much longer I can keep trying."

841,depression,I feel unwanted.,"In every friend group I’ve been in I’ve felt like if I wasn’t there or if I died, nothing would change. The dynamic would be the same, everyone would be just as good friends, and the group would look virtually the same. It’s not hard to see that my friends are better friends with each other than with me and while I’m not against them having better friendships, it hurts how apparent it is and how big the gap is. Any time I’ve hung out with friends, I’ll hear stories about other times they’ve hung out, definitely without me. Just earlier today I was leaving to go on a walk and I saw a groups of my friends heading to another friend’s dorm, and I was never told anything. I don’t expect to be invited to or involved with everything, but this isn’t the first time and it still hurts. I feel like if I just distanced myself or left entirely, I’d have no one. I’d be completely alone at college if I left the people who actively exclude me and I have no idea what to do. I don’t know if it’s because I’m a bad friend in a way I don’t realize, if I’ve done something that I don’t realize, or if it’s just all in my head."
842,depression,How do I unlearn negative beliefs about myself?,"So I have a few learned behaviors and beliefs from my childhood that are affecting me now in adulthood. My parents told me often I was useless and retarded, and I find myself living as if these things are true. It took a long time to realize that my negative self talk stems from those experiences, but my subconscious is still believing these things. So I know where it’s from, but how do I stop believing it? How do I move on and stop self sabotaging myself due to the fact that I think I’m useless?"

I've been told I'm not worth the trouble, that I'm insufferable. It is true but still. Everyone in this damn world seems so cruel and selfish.  How are there so many depressed lonely people in the world and I can't find one that will put up with me? It makes no sense to me. I just don't want to be alone my whole life until I'm dead ffs. No matter how I struggle or pretend to be someone else it always ends the same. I am alone and I'm probably going to die alone. That just makes me want to end it now and get it over with. I can't handle that nobody will ever love me for me. I'm just so angry and I hate everything and want it to be over. Anyone I talk to online ghosts me it has destroyed any shred of hope I cling onto. I can hardly even try anymore because I know it will end the same anyway. It is a cycle of trying, failing, over and over and over and it will only end when I kill myself because the alternative is : somebody gives me a chance and we become friends forever and doesn't that sound lovely? somebody doesn't  mind I'm a loser freak HAHAHAHAH that will never happen. No wonder I have no friends. I'm clearly going insane. Sorry you had to read this"
845,depression,I Cannot Give Myself Morale Boosts,"I have never given myself morale boosts. Thinking back on my entire life, then and now I can safely say at no point has my brain ever went ""you can do it"",""You got this"",""You tried hard but you will get it next time"", etc. I can only thing in negatives or a completely blank slate and to encourage myself I need to manually think about doing it, think of the words and say it and it all comes across as so forced and fake that I just feel like a pathetic loser needing to this and I just feel worse than thinking nothing.

I feel like this is just a part of my brain I was never born with. I could blame my upbringing and life and how I cannot recall a single time that anyone; friends, family, superiors, teachers, etc. have ever given me any morale support or encouragement. I can't think of a single thing at all where people were supporting, just a gigantic wave of no one really caring or smiling and nodding. Fuck even now whenever I see people encouraging or supporting I think it's completely fake and bullshit or just an automatic canned response even if they are genuine I cannot believe them and I think people are just forced to say this due to how society is. I think that not a single person gives a fuck about anyone else and will constantly be disappointed, talk shit about someone behind their back or just completely uncaring and I don't know why this is. 

I don't think all the help in the world can help me on this one and it kills me inside and makes me want to cry I am like this. I want help but I can't believe any of it and I can't convince myself to ever say nice things about myself or to amp myself up or anything. How can I even take a therapists words to hear if I think everything is bullshit?"

847,depression,Chronic pain is killing me physically and mentally,I just feel like I'm full of all the problems that anyone can go through but the worst of them is the physical pain. Everyday I go to sleep with migraines and stomach aches that makes me want to just die and the feeling when waking up is just worse. I cant do many of the normal activities because of my health. I've went to doctors so many times but they also give me medicine that doesnt really help. Also I keep thinking how my body and face looks like shit so my body dysmorphia isnt helping with my mental state. The thing is I was never born like this is all result of my bad habits that slowly got worse over the years and i regret it every single day for not stopping while I had a chance. There is a lot to more to say but even typing this feels too tiring. I'm just thinking of suicide every single day and I cant imagine when it gets worse.
848,depression,I can't stop thinking that's something's wrong with me,"Posting this on my usual depression-related throwaway account.

I've been trying so hard these past months. I'm on my meds, I'm working out, saving money so I can move. I'm doing hobbies again, taking care of my chores. Emotionally I'm better than I've been in years.

But it still doesn't help. I'm still alone. I have one friend who lives two states away from me and rarely talks to me. I'm head over heels in love with my only other friend, but she's moving 300 miles away to live with her ex and I'll likely never see her again. I've dated off and on this past year, but I can never make it more than a month before I'm passed over for someone else. Before that, I can't even begin to count the number of friends I've lost just because they stop talking to me. One minute things are fine, the next minute they're gone.

It's like the theme of my life. No matter who I meet, no matter who I befriend, they always leave. And most times, they leave me for someone else. And I know it's my depression talking, but I can't help but feel like it's because something is inherently wrong with me. That I don't get to be with people because I'm fundamentally wrong inside and everyone but me can see it.

I don't know how to fix this. I don't know if it can be fixed. But I'm scared to even try anymore because I don't know if the new people I find will just wind up hurting me more. I'm 27 years old, but I feel like I'm struggling with shit that an 8-year-old has figured out already.

I'm sorry if this came off whiny. I just don't know anymore."
849,depression,Even when things are going well I’m still thinking “I’d rather be dead than alive”,Because at the end of the day. It’s all meaningless.

But its not healthy to hold it in. Is there anyone else who’s been this way, or some ideas? I used to get uncomfortable enough to get up but ive sort of grown accustomed to a full bladder or just going on the floor."
855,depression,No matter what I do it's just the same,"Just needing to vent.
Every time I try to do better, I end up feeling the same. I'm over-weight and I tell myself that it's okay and I will start exercising and eating better but I have no motivation 99% of the time and I also every time I visit my dad, he is always telling me I need to drink water and he compares me to my sister who is the skinny one. I sometimes do starve myself for days and then I will binge.

I know I need professional help because I always have those bad thoughts that I'm not good enough, I'm too fat, everyone would be better off without me, I just want to kill myself, but I can't get help. I have no insurance and don't money to pay a hospital or a therapist. I feel like I have no one to talk to about this, my partner always gets upset when I do talk to them about it, and I don't have any friends. I've always been too sensitive, and every little thing just makes me think too much. I can never stay at a job for too long, people can be so fucking rude too you over nothing.

I've tried doing drugs and drinking but my body doesn't like to react to it how it should. It takes me double and triple the amount with drugs just too feel something that last more than a minute and I can drink all I want but my brain always has to ruin it. One minute I will be all drunk and happy and then the next I will be sober and in my head. 

I just want to die. I believe in God, and I pray to Him all the time to just let me come home to Him, but now I don't even want to do that because I feel like I'm disappointing Him or/ making Him annoyed. 

I tried killing myself three times but the only thing it did was make me feel like shit, I'm pretty sure I fucked up my kidney.

I don't know what to do anymore, I can't kill myself correctly and living just so hard, but then I feel guilty about feeling this way because I have so much when others have so little. And now I might be pregnant, I hungry and tired all the time now. I have to take another test in a couple days because the line was too faint. I don't want to bring a baby into this shitty world, plus being pregnant and depressed is bad for the baby."
856,depression,Progress doesn't help,"Tired of seeing advice for depression having to due with progress and improving life. That if you get 1% better everyday that things will get back to 100%. It's simply not true. 

Three years ago, I never left me bed and smoked weed constantly. I paid for university and didn't go to a single class. I didn't talk to anyone, online and especially in person. I did 0 things in a day but exist. 

Two years ago, I got a job working 9-5 at minimum wage. I saved up and paid off my student debt fully. I bought myself clothes and games and even managed to make some connections with coworkers. I was sober. On my time off work however, I just sat and thought of how I'm not accomplishing much, and this was to be my life forever. 

This year, I'm back in university. Im only a half year away from graduating with a finance degree, and have been getting top marks in most my classes. I work out 3-4 times a week and diet on top. I sometimes go out on weekends with friends to get drinks. At night, I smoke a little and read a lot. I have a balanced day start to finish that's often full with responsibilities I fulfill. 

You know what hasn't changed? I'm depressed. Maybe worst than I was more. I'm closer to ending it. It doesn't matter what I add or subtract. I find no meaning to life. This is an illness, not a life state."

Me, being stubborn, decided to find her. I check out a couple of her favorite places and found her in nearby town. I gave her sweets that I bought for her earlier and sat besides her in silence.
I knew that she takes long walks to avoid people so I didn't want to force any conversations. 
After 2 hours of wandering around the town L headed to her home. I walked her there and we parted ways. 

Her phone is still turned off. I don't know what should I do. Will visiting her today be fine or is it too much? Will it be too selfish and annoying? I don't want make her angry but I'm really worried. Her mental state was getting worse lately and I don't want to let her attempt again.

I was 13 years old, and I wrote “I sometimes wish I wasn’t here. If I weren’t here I wouldn’t know it.” I wrote some other things about “nobody would miss me until I’m gone” and “The only person I have is you God, so please please help me.” And this just hurts me so bad like after reading that I just can’t stop crying because I still feel this way.

Some of my guy friends are just so nice to me and we have a lot to talk about. I haven't really found this with a girl before. Or maybe I was close and I squandered it. Why do I have to go after girls to find what I'm looking for when I know so many great straight guys. This is just so unfair, if only I was just a girl.

I'm not even bad looking, I put a lot of effort into looking good. And I can deal with pain of periods, i cut myself a lot and I go to the gym at least six days a week. I can handle caronlina reapers simply because I like to cry from spicy food. I can do whatever a girl has to do. I'm just not one. And I do like the way girls look, and I do have crushes on girls too sometimes. But it never works out. sigh.

I just want to be loved by someone, have them tell me that they admire me. Am I asking for too much? I've worked so hard this past year."

879,depression,My experience...," 

Hi Everyone 

I just joined this group and wanted to share an experience I hope will offer encouragement to anyone who is in the same position I once found myself. Earlier in my life I had some serious issues with anxiety and depression. After spending some time utilising various coping mechanisms I experienced a particularly difficult period. This experience was horrific. It made me wish I had never been born. But it terrified me so much it spurned me into action. I decided to abandon the coping strategy I had clung to and pursue the root cause of my issues. I believed that if I found the root cause I would be able to address this and cure myself of these symptoms for good. I made a list of treatments I thought might allow me to do this. I worked my way through this list. One of these approaches allowed me to get to the root cause of my depression and anxiety and resolve the issue. I went from being someone who was being crushed by the weight of my emotions to someone who wakes up with an optimistic attitude to life’s challenges. I now start my days with a genuine excitement about the future. I walked this path and made this transition. If you walk this path you can make the same discoveries, the same changes and be cured. "

882,depression,I have totally given up because of my agoraphobia its driving me crazy,I'm always thinking something bad will happen. I lost my job in 2019 and I cant seem to catch a break with panic attacks. I havent worker in 2 years 4 months which I dont blame myself for. People always take advantage of me they abuse me backstabbing me. I don't want to know anymore with the world I just want to stay home and not go out but I cant. I'm always fking scared I cant even go to a place that I want to go important errands like the bank alone or to the doctor alone my anxiety goes up to a 100000 apart from that I am desperate desperate to be alone and I feel doomed a lot doomed I'm always depressed crying everyday nothing can make me feel better. Money is a big issue for me always was even when i worked my ass off it was all for NOTHING even friends i always felt not food enough for them and relationships I tried tried so hard and got simply nothing just abuse
883,depression,I feel depressed,"No amount of positive thinking and the many self help books (although they did help and change my perspective to an extent) helps when the weight of depression comes in out of no where. And I wonder why towards the end of the month is it so. 
I am currently on Escitalopram. And imo it works far better for me than other antidepressants I was tried on.
I was diagnosed with Chronic Depression &amp; Anxiety in Jan 2019."

885,depression,i think i’m going back into depression,hi. i’m 18 years old and i’ve been depressed for about 2 1/2 years now. it started my sophomore year and it was just normal depression over silly things i almost feel like break up losing my friends and just growing up. but it got worse into covid. i started smoking a lot and it wasn’t the best i dropped the sport i loved and just a stayed home and watched tv all day. i finally started to get out of it towards the end of the year and went back to football but i lost my best friend before the year ended. i’m not sure i haven’t ever felt the same since i’ve felt like i always see people with best friend they’re always with 24/7 and i just guess i never have it and don’t think i ever will. i also had a crush on this girl for 2 years but she had a bf they’re broken up and i told her how i feel but i don’t think she feels the same plus she just got out it doesn’t affected me much anymore idk y but i just have accepted it and all. i talked to one girl who really liked me but we couldn’t date because she’s going to another college. i asked her to prom but she already got asked. i haven’t ever been to a dnace really so i’m really nervous about it which is crazy but yeah so it’s just hard and i’m scared i won’t get to go to my last dance because idk who would go with me. i’m not ugly i think i’m the opposite but it’s just hard idk where to go anymore and all my fun was wasted by me.
886,depression,I have been existentially depressed and chronically bored for years.,"It started when I was 12 or so, I don’t remember what it was like very well back then, but I do remember dodging responsibilities and I got bored of things I used to like etc. I believe it came about after rejecting Christian religious beliefs after realizing it’s just a mythology that the indoctrinated indoctrinate to young, naive children. I got professional heath, and felt better. Got depressed again after a while, but this time with suicidal thoughts. I got professional heath again, but that did me nothing. Though I did overcome this episode after about a year or two. I had slowly started to get “back on track”. I started with my hygiene, then with my school grades. Fast forward a few years of being an A+ student and I am realizing that my depression has never left me. I am an agnostic and I often contemplate things when I am bored (which is a lot). I have been getting the symptoms I had at the very start, boredom and a sort of restless-tiredness. On the weekends I sleep 15 hrs or so, I find something to do and get bored in 15 minutes. Everything in my life seems like a boring chore that never ends, like a grind for nothing.
Sometimes I feel happy, but then I realize how stupid it all is. I cant stop thinking about how nothing matters and everything I do is meaningless. I wonder what I’m even still here for. I don’t have anyone I care about enough to keep living, I don’t have anything that seems worth waking up and doing all the tedious chores of my life. The only thing keeping me from killing myself is the fear of messing up, and if the next plane of existence is worse than this one. And now any form of help is useless because in the back of my head I know being “mentally heathy” is another way of saying distracted and oblivious to the truth and reality."
887,depression,I don’t know how to do this,"I’ve never made a post before. 

Idk how to do this. Idk how to do anything really. I feel like I’m stumbling through life for no reason. You know how people ask “what would you tell your younger self” I’d say just fucking do it. You know what I mean. JUST FUCKING DO IT. Spare everyone the trouble. It doesn’t get better. You keep hurting everyone around you. No one really wants you. They may act like they do sometimes but they make it apparent that they don’t really. they’d be so much better without you. It would all be so much better if you didn’t be in the first place. Never there to bother anyone. You just fuck everything up. You think hey this is actually going okay but oh wait no it’s not it’s just as bad as it ever was even worse actually because you made everyone think you were okay and then you pulled this stupid shit and made everyone hate you because you hate yourself and you want to not exist. You don’t wanna die necessarily. You want to have not been. You want to go back and make it possible that you weren’t even a thought. But that’s not possible. So just go back and end it before you met anyone in your current life. Yeah your parents might think of you and hurt a little bit but let’s be honest they’re gonna forget you existed they never cared anyway you weren’t the favorite or even the preferred. Didn’t matter how hard you tried. Where did that get you? Nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. You fucking failure. JUST DO IT. Just disappear. Everyone will move on. You aren’t a significant mark in any ones life."

889,depression,My therapist and other friends of the past thinks my parents caused my mental issues. I'm not sure though. What should I do?,"The reason I'm asking this is because I don't know if I believe them. Ive had depression for the last 7 years and since I'm 25 going on 26 that's basically my entire adult life so far. But mostly all my life I've dealt with anxiety, super lower confidence, extreme lack of social skills to the point where I can't connect with people and sometimes just general anti social behavior from what I've been told. 

It's ruined my life in everyway possible. But my therapist and friends say that my parents have basically messed me up mentally and emotionally. I would like to not say so because I am an adult and a guy so I should be able to be mentally strong enough to move on no matter what. 

Because in my opinion my parents did a lot for me. I always had food. And they made sure I had clothes etc. There were a few downsides as my parents were protective so they didn't allow me to stay the night at my friends until I was a nearly a senior in high school. I also had a curfew at 8pm as well then which only was lifted after I graduated high school.

My parents pushed me to be great at everything. Including my looks as they would point out any flaw I had throughput the day like teeth not being super white or hair messy or didn't smell amazing even in public. Sports was big too. Even though after I stopped most of my family just called me a waste of size or they called me a bad return on investment.

And even as an adult they don't want me getting a job with a white population too large as they think I'll get hurt because I'm in a minority group. 

There's more to it but I don't think these things should have large impact into my adult life. And I think it's my fault that I'm not mentally stronger and fell into a 7 years major depression disorder that anti depressants can't even fix.  

Idk what to think anymore..do they have a point or am I just weak?"

im 15 turning 16 next month and from the philippines
I know im stupid and careless and irresponsible for letting this happen that i have been crying myself to sleep every night. ive been meeting him for weeks now and really liked him he was always sweet and kind and funny. i really felt safe being with him until one day he was upset because we still havent done ""anything"" and i didnt want to upset him because hes done so much for me already so I let him do what he wanted.

ill never forget how my mom shouted and slapped me saying me and my sister now have to work side jobs to raise money for an abortion and i agreed.
I know I have to have an abortion because my parents cannot afford to raise another child. my dad lost his job because covid here in the philippines is so bad.
some of my friends gave me some money for the abortion and i love them so much but its just not enough. abortion in the philippines is illegal so the clinic im going to is asking alot.

ive been calling the guy who got me pregnant to atleast help in paying the clinic but hes blocked me on all social media accounts. im so stupid and feel so angry towards myself for letting this happen. ive been having random break downs in my room and im always panicking and dont know what to do. im also scared to have an abortion because ive never done it.
i dont even know why im posting this here on the internet."
891,depression,Every sunday I want to die,"(vent) I'm just it happens to a lot that really hates what they're doing in life and suffers from depression.
Every sunday I want to die because I don't want to go back to pursue school in a field I don't like, where I know way less than my classmates and that my anxiety make me miss because I can't get through my front door in the morning.
Some days I just call in sick, hating myseld because I'm missing my education, promising myself I'll use this free time to catch up what I'm late behind... and then it's already 8pm and I did nothing, the day went fast while doing nothing. And so it starts again. 
5 days go by, it's friday evening, I'm relieved that the week is over, promise I'll work during the week end... saturday I stress about sunday and all the work I have to do, sunday goes by and nothing happened. I just know I'll have to go through another week. 
And in this situation I just want to end it all. Always finding a new way to die on my way to school. 
Rince and repeat.

I know I just need to be able to make a full week at school to feel somewhat less of a waste. But for now I struggle with that too."

I cut myself twice this week, I cried so hard I feel like vomiting and my body genuinely hurts....i feel like I am just a manifestation of everyone's hatred. I have wanted to die since I was 9 or so and it's just... exhausting.

No one seems to feel love or appreciation towards me, only hate and disgust. My bf told me to ""cry him a river"" when I tried to tell him I felt like he hated me. I called the suicide hotline and it didn't really help much, the person was very nice and gentle with me but it just made me sad that no one in my life talks to me that way or listens to me as much as they did ....

I guess I just desperately need human compassion and comfort right now, if anyone has any sort of phrases or something that help them when they feel like this I would really appreciate it...thank you~"
894,depression,I opened up to a man I barely know but I feel so sad and I regret it :(,I got so drunk on the weekend and I called a man (who I slept with once but things did not workout between us and he stopped talking to me). I cried and cried and cried. I asked him to give me a chance and he said that we have to move on. We talked for a little and I told him about my sexual assault (I have only shared this information with one other person) somehow it felt nice to talk to a stranger/someone I barely know about what happened. He said he is here for me if I need anything. But I don’t believe it. He must think I am pathetic :( he checked on me the next day but it has been 4 days since I last heard from him. It hurts so much that I got abandoned after I revealed my secret

I don't even have social skills and my body is so small for my age. I tried to start again and making something with my life but it's the same thing over and over again. I have nightmares with my past. I don't like sleep. I don't like food anymore. I'm boring. I'm so empty.
897,depression,I feel like I have nothing to live for,"Hello all. I guess I’m just going to sulk for a bit. I got married in 2019. I love my wife with everything I have and she means the world to me. Our sex life has not been the best because I have a very high sex drive and she has a low sex drive. Unfortunately my sexual frustration lead to porn and then lead to me messaging a sex partner from high school (completely virtual…. I have never met this lady in person and that was my justification… I knew it was wrong once I messaged her) I then told the woman that I could not have a relationship outside of my marriage). I ended up telling my wife what happened because I wanted to be honest and transparent with her. It broke her heart but things are slowly getting back to normal. 

I never saw this coming and I feel like a total piece of shit. My and my wife are going through counseling but I know she deserves better. I also recently quit my job due to getting death threats and can’t find a good paying job that will accept me. I honestly feel like killing myself but I don’t want to hurt my wife or family. I just never knew that life would be this hard. I never knew that I would go down this path. I hate myself. I feel like all of my “friends “ have abandoned me after college and I can’t seem to make new friends. I just don’t see a point…. Nothing in life feels worth and I just feel like a fuck up."

899,depression,I want to marry the guy that tried to rape me,"There was a guy that I met a long time ago at a bar. He was hitting on me while I was drunk, and I'm 85% sure he roofied me that night. I had to get taken back home, and he tried to stay with me, but my guy friend didn't let him stay.

I've always known that he tried to take advantage of me. What didn't help was that around the same time, another guy led me on, only for him to have a girlfriend the whole time. I was really bummed out about my crush, but I saw that this guy actually wanted me. He was so overt about his interest too. I know that he's likely taken advantage of other girls before, but he thinks I'm beautiful, and he wanted me. I want to get married and have a family with him.

That night, I likely would've gotten pregnant. It terrifies me to say this, but I would actually be thrilled to be a mother. I've never had a guy like me before, so I've always wondered if I'll be able to have a family. In marriage, there is compromise. I know he'd likely rape and beat me (he has a violent streak), but I want a family more than anything else. Sometimes, I fantasize about him loving and taking care of me, but most of the time, I think realistically. Knowing what I know about him, he'd want me to be financially dependent on him, and I'd pretty much have to cater to his every whims. I imagine him slapping me in the face, shaving my hair off, covering my mouth while I scream, but I still want to be with him so bad."

My girlfriend (of 2 years) at the time had just broken up with me, I was trying to pull myself out of academic ruin caused by online classes, and the general culture of my housemates was toxic. I fell into some pretty serious drug addiction, along with heavy alcohol abuse, and I fell back into self-harm.

By the end of the semester, it had become pretty clear to me I needed to take this semester off. My parents moved me out of the house and I've set up a pretty healthy environment for myself here. I'm now 3 months clean of coke, 2 months clean from Xanax, I haven't had more than one drink in a night since I left school (excluding NYE), and I've finally come to a point where I can comfortably say I will never intentionally harm myself again.

But for whatever reason, my emotional state feels far worse than it was at school. I'm constantly lonely, I can't sleep, I cry all the time, and my panic attacks have gotten worse. I feel so alone."

After a few months now, I have learned that I have no friends. Seriously. No one to hang out with or anything. I have one guy who texts me maybe twice a week, but we never hang out and when I ask him he's too busy. I'm almost 20 and every single one of my"" friends"" will put no effort into our friendship. The worst part being that on the rare occasion that I do hang out with someone I end up hearing about what they did with they're friends recently and for some reason I'm never invited. I made one of my closest friends ever this semester and when I knew I was going to fail, I called him up and we talked. That isn't something I do with anyone. I don't open up about how fucked up my life really is but I did. Since then I literally haven't gotten one text from him. So clearly opening up just drives people away. Am I supposed to be lonely forever? Is this a normal experience? Is it my social anxiety? Am I reading too much into this? What can I do to make real friends?

Also when I am feeling low, i just become the biggest bitch to people around me so i try to see less of them and be alone.

This is actually so embarrassing but I honestly don’t know what to do anymore . It’s becoming super depressing to the point where I’m just blank 😞 I’m sure plenty of you have been there . We moved from New York to FL so my son can be closer to his dad . He’s 6 and just to get away start over you know . The beginning wasn’t so bad we’ve been staying at hotels , we had food my son has been with his dad since which is fine I wouldn’t want him in hotels when he can be safe and comfortable in a home and plus he needs his dad so I’m grateful for that . Besides the fact that I miss him being with me everyday I wouldn’t want to any other way giving the circumstances of my situation right now . So my husband and I have done the hotel thing , working and everything was ok until we both got covid so bad which was like 2 weeks ago and couldn’t work . Unfortunately lost our jobs because of it and now basically homeless because we cannot afford the hotels it’s just way too much . It’s been really tough these past days and I’m just not sure what to do anymore all I wanted to do was come down make a better life for us . And now I’m just stuck not knowing what my next move is going to be.  We have no family no friends just nothing. I wanted to save up to get my apartment it’s nothing for us to get a job at all but the issue is we need a stable place and I know people say that everything happens for a reason and I’m trying to keep in good spirits but I just really need some help . If anyone can help me with anything at all even just guidance please do comment . This is so embarrassing and justi sad . I read all these posts all the time and now im like wow look at me . If anyone knows someone that has a place for us until we can get on our feet which is really nothing for us we just really need help in any way possible. Thank you in advance"
914,depression,Why try when my efforts don't matter?,"On my last year before college and i hate everything about school, work and responsibilities right now. I moved to a different school because the previous place i went to would send me to suicide if i stayed longer. Now I'm in a different place and yet I'm still the same old failure of a person.

I used to be the best student. I was a genius, i had a future. I won competitions, and now i can barely get by in school.

I barely managed to pass this year's first quarter. My report card is filled with bad and sometimes even missing grades. I don't even try to have good grades anymore. I have to force myself to do the bare minimum when it comes to school work. I can't talk to people anymore. I'm literally a husk of my former self.

Last week tho, i tried to do work. I did it, no matter how small it is. I was actually happy about that one. That is until i received news that the effort i made barely made an impact on my grade.

So why should i put effort? Why shouldn't i just sit here and rot away? It's not like i can do anything else anyway."

i have stopped caring about the food i eat now that i hate myself so much and only think about how fat it’s going to make me. i am obsessed with my body image and every day i feel like i am gaining weight instead of losing it. because of quarantine making me sedentary i am considered now obese and being the hypochondriac i am i cant fucking stop thinking about it every waking moment of my life. i spend all my free time walking/running around but i doubt it is helping.

my head is constantly filled with anxieties and self hatred. rare instances of clarity and peace are weekly at best.

i am too scared of death to kill myself

i want to hurt myself but then i will have to tell my therapist (re: my own morals) which will be embarassing and further push back surgeries i need to have (because i’m a threat to myself, awwww). also dealing with the aftermath (hurting everytime i shower or some dumb shit like that)

i hate all of my (few) friends and i feel so alone

i feel so fucking neurotic and awful and yet all i can do is wake up, go to class, go to work, go to class, then do it all over again

i wish i had someone in my life romantically because i am clearly incapable of loving myself

i just dont want to do it anymore. there really is no fucking point. i’m pursuing my “passion” and even that does not fulfill me. i am fucking talentless and neurotic. 

i can’t move back home because my brother is a violent alcoholic/drug addict and my father is emotionally abusive. but staying here, rotting away in my own head is slowly killing me. i wish i could hospitalize myself until i learn how to fucking be normal but then i would screw up my entire degree.

i just don’t get why i’m not happy. i’m supposed to be happy by now. i’m supposed to be happy being away from my family. being away from my small town. being in a huge city with plenty of opportunities. going to college. meeting people. but all i do is work. it’s all i fucking can do with covid rampant everywhere.

i am so cynical that being around other people makes me angry when they are literally doing nothing. my roommate drives me insane by doing fucking nothing. it’s just my goddamn head.

i want out. i just want out."

Before I could pretend to engage but now I couldn’t anymore. I’d rather spend time with a dog."
919,depression,It’s so taboo that no one thinks I’m serious.,"I’m sinking deeper everyday, but I don’t expect much support from people around me since depression itself is seen as taboo in my family. I’m sure they know but just don’t see it as a problem.
Honestly, I just need a helping hand so that I can do something again, studying an online course/uni again, getting a job, making friends again, dating.
Doing everything for yourself since your  mid teens makes you forget to occasionally ask for help and now no one around me really expects me to do that. There’s just too much weight I’m carrying.
I had a lot of terrible stuff happen to me leading up to me having to leave med school and then being where I’m at now and I swear whatever I do just isn’t enough to get myself out. 
When there are good days, I don’t even think I deserve those few moments of happiness since I’m really only ignoring my reality. It’s always distracting me
I want to accomplish something without losing any more years from my life but I can’t even bring myself to go outside.
And it’s slowly becoming: can’t clean, can’t cook, can’t leave my room.

I’m disappointing others but I’m disappointing myself the most.

I feel like I’m going to go and see a therapist really soon. I didn’t want to for a long time.

It’s taken so many years away from my life.

925,depression,I just need some help.,"So, for as long as I can remember I’ve had these thoughts of self-harming and suicide. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m failing life, and just feel like I’m not cut out for living. What the point in trying anymore? I’ve got no interests and I feel like I’m going nowhere. Pretty much everyday I think about killings myself, how is do it and what I’d leave behind for people to find after. Why do I want to have a big scar across my chest or arms. I don’t think suicide is a likely option for me as I’m just too much of a coward to go through with it. But the self-harm is very likely at the moment. I just don’t understand, when I think of life I think its beautiful but I can’t see where I fit in. I don’t see a point to me living because I feel like a burden to everyone around me. I’ve realised recently that life is very short so why even try to make something of myself. I have no interests and I just don’t know what to do anymore. 

I understand that there is no definitive answer to my questions so feel free to read and move on.

they always left me unchecked and didn't care what I did alone in my room. now I'm a sociopath who has no drive or reason to live"
927,depression,I don’t know how to feel normal anymore,"I usually post on an alt but I forgot the password whoops. 

A few months ago I cold turkeyed my meds thinking I didn’t need them anymore, which caused me to spiral a bit, and then start taking them again. What I’ve ended up realizing is that either way I don’t feel okay. Either I feel down, hopeless and alone. or I feel completely numb to emotions, the world dulled completely by my SSRIs. I wish I could just return to being *normal* to not having to drug myself to not feel bleak everyday. Therapy has helped but it isn’t the answer, I don’t know what is. 

Even with my meds and my friends I feel isolated all the time, I feel unloved and unappreciated. What sucks is I know my friends care about me but I continuously push them away, either actively or by accident. It feels like eventually it’ll just be me and my dog. 

Things have been getting progressively worse over the years, more and more things escalate to a point where it becomes unbearable. Im not suicidal, but I also don’t know how much worse I can feel before it reaches a critical mass. 

Apologies if it’s scattershot, I just need to vent. Thank you."

931,depression,"i fucked up so bad now i fell into a great depression to the point i cant eat or sleep (PLEASE READ) i need guidance, advice, anything, prayer?"," Okay background: I'm 20, I had a sheltered and isolating upbringing, I never did something like runaway before, I ran away from home with my uncle and cousins, everything went well, for the first time ever, I was happy as shit, did things I never did before, socialized, etc, my mom called A LOT and I wanted to be respectful, so I always answered. (this is where I fucked up tbh) some weeks passed, and after my grandma and mom spent days begging me to come back, I made the choice to come back home, for a multitude of stupid reasons, I believed i was emotionally manipulated into doing it, i didn't think of all the traumatic things my parents done to me, i was focused on the anxiety i was having from the stuff my family told me would happen if i stayed, (I know it doesn't make sense for me to come back its like I was under a spell or something) and when I made the choice, I forgot how controlling my parents were, I wasn't thinking about why I left in the first place, its like I was brainwashed, they promised to help me get a place, job, etc, and that i could stay with my grandma (which didn't end up happening) (I wasn't thinking at all i feel incredibly stupid), my parents were fear mongering and telling me how if I stayed with my uncle bad things would happen, **(which triggered my anxiety and I felt like I was on edge the whole time I was there)** (I was also sick with covid at the time and and they claimed I would get worse if I didn't come back home) and that I was being used by my uncle for money, (because I get a disability check) which I later found out not to be true, I had an honest talk with them (my uncle and the rest) after coming back home, they told me they never cared about the money and i could tell they was mad at me for believing this, because they been nothing but good to me, so i'm not too sure why i let my family trick me into believing i was being used... i feel like maybe it's because i'm not use to be treated like a decent human being maybe? and believing i was being used was how i made sense of it? i don't know i'm fucking stupid. **once i came back home, i started to fall into a deep depression and regret and shame, and embarrassment, I started remembering things from the past like the time my mom made me eat food she spit up as a punishment, she claimed i was being ""disrespectful"" I was like 12 or something at the time, another time they whooped me, stripped me naked, turned r&amp;b music on while whooping me, another time, made me stand in corner, while holding a squat, growing up my dad always did things to purposely make me mad, my dad made weird faces, laughed in my face while crying, and got pleasure from it saying things like yes! yes! and the more i would get worked up, the more he mocked me, they would call me weird, slap me in face, check my phone and criticize things i said to people, rip up songs i made, claiming they were too depressing, and made jokes about it, most of these things happened when i was 14, it gotten ""better"" as years passed by so sometimes i believed i was being dramatic and that i was never actually abused (i self gaslighted myself a lot)(I think this is also how they was able to convince me to come back) I tried to forget that these things ever happened, but when i came back home, it hit me with full force. along with the regret of coming back.** now that i'm back, they haven't done anything bad to me, BUT now that these memories resurfaced, I feel this intense hatred, towards them, and I honestly want them out of my life for good, but I cant now, and to make it worse, I reached out to my uncle and cousins begging for a second chance, and how I screwed up, and they said ""your parents were sending a lot of disrespectful stuff to our phone and it put us through a lot of stress, and we feel like we picked you up for nothing, so its out of our hands not much we can do to help you now"" (which I totally understand I didn't think about the stress i was putting them through) But it hurts knowing that the only people that's capable of helping me, cant help me anymore, and i feel like it's my fault because I was the one who ultimately made the choice to come back and i feel incredibly stupid, I feel crippled with regret so much to the point i barely eat and sleep. because i had one shot to change my life for the better and i fucked it up for myself. and I don't think they sympathize with me because their like ""you the one that decided to come back"" not your mom, not your dad, YOU and it just makes me feel so fucking stupid. because I really didn't think this through. and suicide feels like the only way out of these thoughts, shame ,etc. LIKE I WAS LITERALLY FREEEEE and I came back home, i know there is probably many people here who wish they had the opportunity I had, I feel like I deserve to die for doing something so stupid. I just can't live with myself after doing this. i don't know what to do now, each day here feels like hell and i get really emotional around them so i distance myself and stay in my room.

I got into a relationship last year and it quickly turned physically abusive but I was hoping that he would kill me.

944,depression,My house is disgusting,"Hello, I’m a (31F) In the throes of a bad depressive episode. I also have ADHD and CPTSD, due to some issues with my job I have been off work for two months now and in that time I have done absolutely nothing. My dishes have gotten so bad that I occasionally just throw things away that look like they can’t be saved. About once a week I will go around my house and gather up all the trash and throw it out and bag up dirty laundry that my cats of peed on after I clean up their litter box. I know that my environment is making my depression worse I can’t seem to move. I keep trying to set up counseling in to see somebody but everybody is full or they don’t specialize in trauma. I was sober but I relapsed and that’s definitely contributing to how I feel. I stopped being able to socialize, anytime around people I just fight or shut down. I ran up about five grand on a credit card just to feel better for a moment, and I’m desperately just trying to find relief in dating apps and attention I immediately regret and delete. 

How do I break this? How do I get out of this? I’m terrified of going back to work because I don’t remember the last time I spent 10 hours on my feet. Before December sometime. I’m just laying here and binge eating, pushing people away and isolating. I can’t seem to stop. I’ve even taken prescription stimulants that are prescribed to me, and they just make my heart race but I’m still paralyzed. I don’t know what to do. I hate myself like this."

however, when i DO put effort, it never feels reciprocated and it hurts. it hurts to feel left out by people, like they think you’re annoying or that they don’t like you for whatever reason. it’s scary. i never feel like the first choice for anyone, and i haven’t felt that way since MIDDLE school (I’m 22 now!!!). the last time i had a best friend who i genuinely enjoyed being around and didn’t worry about feeling judged was in middle school. that’s so sad to me. 

it just feels like putting all this effort in is pointless when i’m never going to be enough for anyone anyway. it genuinely is not fun to hang out with someone for me one on one. and i know it’s because i’m subconsciously fearing judgment and abandonment. but for some reason, I’m more willing to put the effort in for romantic relationships and it feels more fun. maybe because i feel a sense of validation more easily."

Im so unhappy most days and struggle to find the things i used to love doing amusing anymore. Ive seen this change in myself and its made my self confidence really low, i hate who i am and yet im stuck, i cant get out of this hell. To make matters extremely worse, my boyfriend of around 8 months has noticed the change, and can no longer love who i am/ becoming. This makes it harder to love myself as im never enough, my happiest self never stays as recovery isnt linear and the people i meet during my highs never stay for the lows.

962,depression,"How to help a withdrawn (introverted, depressed) friend?","Someone I’m close to (in fact, he’s called me his best friend before) has just started falling off recently. I know he has a history of depression and has somewhat recently started meds, but he also hasn’t been the same since starting the meds. He’s been forgetful and checked out. He’s also been bailing on our plans. I recently asked him what was going on and he just said that he needed space and doesn’t have capacity to talk about anything that isn’t “emotional or deep.” I asked him what that meant and he just said that he doesn’t want to talk in general and that he’s working through some stuff that has nothing to do with me. The thing is, he’s done this to me 6-7 times in the past year and I’ve always checked in from afar (like sending him food and telling him he’s not obligated to respond), but it’s never been this bad. I haven’t spoken to him in around two weeks and I don’t think we’ve ever gone this long without speaking. Right before ghosting me, he randomly dropped off food that his mom made. 

I don’t want to burden him with my life, but I’m also going through serious health struggles. We’re in the same graduate program and he doesn’t seem to have noticed that I haven’t been at school because I have been placed on bed rest. I have multiple surgeries coming up next month and I miss my friend. In the past, he has expressed shame and regret for not being a very attentive friend, but this version of him is next level. He will forget something that I texted him maybe 10 texts ago. 

I know that he’s introverted and gets drained easily, so I don’t want to check in and have our relationship feel like a chore to him. I also don’t know if his depressed brain would feel abandoned if I just continued to give him space. I also don’t want him to feel shame in re-establishing contact with me, especially since I will have gone through a lot of traumatic medical procedures while he is checked out. But at the same time, I don’t want to tell him what’s going on right now since he explicitly set the boundary with me regarding his lack of capacity to care for our friendship right now. 

At the end of the day, I refuse to lose our friendship to this mental illness. I know I need to be the strong one and create an environment that doesn’t fuel existing shame. Does anyone have any advice for me? Additionally, I’m not sure how to navigate this request for space from someone with clear abandonment issues. I don’t want to affirm his belief that people cannot be trusted, but I also feel uneasy about checking in constantly when he is pushing me away. Is it just that I need to be stronger and continue to check in and divorce myself from his response? Introverted folks who struggle with depression: do you actually want to be left alone? Or will it make you feel abandoned and uncared for? What type of cadence of communication makes you feel cared for without draining you?

TLDR; introverted depressed friend is pulling away and I want to make him feel cared for while giving him space at the same time."

I have been in so much pain for so long, and yeah sometimes it got better, and it probably will get better again soon, but it never lasts long. It always gets worse again and each time it does it gets worse and worse and worse. I am a shell of my former self. I hate myself and I hate how much I hate and pity myself but I don't know what else to think. I am falling apart and can barely stay composed throughout the day. I can'barely even get out of bed in the mornings and the only reason I do is because I don't have a choice. I have ruined so many good relationships I had with people and I will continue doing that. I have been on the verge of suicide for months now and nit a single people other than myself knows. I am in so much pain and I want it to end."

966,depression,Always used and then thrown away,"About 4 months ago I met someone through an online dating app and we connected so deeply on an emotional and intellectual level. I havent felt so immediately comfortable and safe and like I belonged with someone since I met my best friend 10 years ago. 

We were both going through a tough time and didn't want to be official, but found comfort in spending our time together just laying in bed holding each other and being there for each other. We had sex a few times, but that didnt even matter that much, it was the closeness and affection and connection that I had never felt before that really filled me with joy. For the first time in a physical relationship, I felt cared for and like my needs were finally being met in a way they never had been in the past. 

He promised me that he would never hurt me like others have in the past, that he would be honest and open with me. 

And then last week, he told me he was struggling to figure out if he could love someone romantically, and that he wanted to talk to me about our relationship and where we stand. I was working over the weekend, so he said we'd talk on Monday, but he bailed last minute saying he was really exhausted and couldn't have a really serious talk and we'd talk on Thursday. 

Today, I messaged him and he suddenly told me that he got back together with his ex-girlfriend on Sunday and that he understands if I never want to speak to him again, but he still wants to be there to support me and be my friend. I cried, I called him some choice words, he said he deserved it. I told him I needed to think about everything.

After talking with a friend, I decided that this wasn't worth losing his friendship when I dont often feel understood or like I belong. I told him that I was willing to be friends but that it would take some time for me to be able to open up to him and trust him again but if he was willing to prove he can be a good friend and gain that trust, I was willing to try. 

He did an immediate 180 and told me he's thought about it and we can't be friends because he will always feel so guilty that he broke that promise that he wouldn't fuck me over like the others did. 

I really thought this was different. I really thought that he cared about me as a person and not just for sex. But, it's just like it always is, used up and then thrown away. 

I was finally starting to feel like the dark cloud hanging over me was clearing up every once in a while. I felt true joy for the first time in years. I finally felt like I was good enough and like I was making progress. I finally started to feel some small amount of love for myself. And now I feel like I'm drowning and can't catch my breath, I feel small and insignificant, I feel unlovable."

968,depression,Depression From Helping Coworker,"So I told my coworker about my anxiety and depression. They mentioned how they go through it as well. Even before that we instantly connected and this just made me feel even closer to them. Unfortunately, I have a soft spot for them now that anything they need, I cant say no. At this point I've been working 10 to 12 hour days to cover for them as I'm too the point that I'm doing their work. I really can't say no and I even encourage it. I tell them how I got them always and I want to, but it's so draining on me. It's actually starting to frustrate me and I've been having anxiety from all the tasks piling up and getting home I just want to cry. I can't stop wanting to be there for this person and help them as much as I can, but it's really messing with me. I'm not sure how to say no and I can't seem to tell them the toll it's taking on me."

971,depression,No Trust,"It's exhausting not being able to trust.

Having been severely bullied, having been abandoned by whole friend groups, having been cheated on in a serious relationship.  It takes a LOT of convincing for me to open up.  Whether that's sharing personal and vulnerable things with friends, or committing myself fully to a relationship without doubts that I would be better off single.  My anxiety throws in intrusive thoughts all the time.  I really just prefer not to talk about myself.  People think it's so weird as if all I can do is have small talk, but it's not that.  I am happy to talk about all kinds of complex and serious topics, or to explore other people's history, but there's a serious block pushing me to avoid talking about my personal issues or feelings.  

It's exhausting being on guard and preparing to be on defense all the time rather than being able to just let me mind rest in the comfort and continuity of trusting the current state of things, and my current company."

So I am asking how to I try to get better? What do I do? I don't have any friends, I have parents in a different country but I am not comfortable with reaching out to them because they were very abusive. So what can I do to be normal? How do I become productive even with this my shit mental? I just need so directions or something. I am so fuck sacred that I will always feel this sad. I need a way out."

Recently I made friends with a colleague and we started texting quite frequently. In the beginning it was quite normal but as we eased into the friendship, I started getting a feeling that they are in depression or were in depression at a certain time. They joke about suicide and depression and stuff like that but never told anything explicitly. 

Our chats don't have much and they always kinda give one word responses and whatnot. I understand it might be that they are just busy or something. But since quite some days she is feeling a bit low. 

Now, as a friend what are some things I can do? We live in different cities so it's pretty much just texting back &amp; forth. I check on them from time to time, send memes &amp; wholesome stuff.. but just wanna know if there's anything else I can do in case they actually have/had depression. 

PS: I know I might be looking too much into the lines, extrapolating unnecessary conclusions and all but I didn't want to take a risk when it comes to this and I just wanna help out a mate!

Thank you for reading,
Cheers."

979,depression,How am I supposed to get better?,"I swear sometimes it feels like over the last decade of seeing psychs I have been diagnosed and tested for just about everything in the book as much fun as it is to know how many lovely little labels I have I'm still fucked (i don't know if I can swear in here I assume I can but I also get kids might be in here so I'm so sorry kids). Now I'm an adult, working full-time, completely unfulfilled, and can't afford to spend $100 a week so that a person sitting on the other end of a computer can tell me my feelings are valid or that they're sorry I went through x,y, or z. I cannot take another decade of paying through the nose to gain no results. The mantra of ""it gets better"" is so relative. Does it? Does it really? Is coping with the constant mental strain of the pit of loneliness and shame and self-hatred really ""getting better""? Is that a way to live the rest of my life? I shell out like 65% of my salary after taxes on rent because I live in a city so I can have a job and at this point, my options are food or therapy. I just don't know how I'm supposed to get better. I'm clearly venting here and once again I'm sorry I just feel like I'm out of options. It's not like mental illness is curable, it's like having internal herpes - yeah sometimes it flairs up and it's really bad and other times it's just kind of nagging in the back of your head but it's always there. The only difference is that this shit is rotting me from the inside out. I can't tell if I should be screaming or punching or crying or just numb at this point. But hey, my cat likes her new toy so that's something I guess."
980,depression,M19 - I’m only happy when I’m high,"I told myself that I’d stop smoking weed until I was an adult because I’m not fully developed. But recently I don’t even care about all that. I don’t see myself having any kind of future and I’m unsure about what I want to do with my life. Everyone else seems to be a step above me and I feel like an idiot all the time.

I’m almost 100% certain I have ADHD. I feel so slow and anxious having to do basic tasks and when I see other people around me completing them so effortlessly, it makes me feel like a complete failure. I want real human connections yet everyone around me feels so artificial.

I feel like I fuck up every social interaction I come into contact with. I’ve tried to work on my social skills for the longest time, but I always feel so slow and clouded. I’ve just began to give up recently and I’ve isolated myself. I sometimes wonder if other people can tell if I’m depressed.

I wonder if they actually care about me or like me as a person. Why would they though when everything that comes out of my mouth is idiotic even when it feels like I’m trying my best. I just have such a hard time relating to most people and I feel like I wasn’t made for this world.

I can’t stand the idea of going to school and working a job until the day I die when I already feel like I’m giving up at 19. People tell me that I’m super smart and that I have so much to live for but I have a hard time believing that. The only choices I have are to face reality and feel depressed or to smoke weed everyday.

Is it really healthy living like this though? I feel like being high gives me a break from reality and makes me much more optimistic about the future, yet once I come down I’m back to how I felt before. Those little breaks are so therapeutic to me though. Should I continue doing what I’m doing? I just don’t know anymore.."

989,depression,Lost everything. Literally going insane. Going to die.,"I've lost everything. I'm in a weird purgatory before suicide.
Everyone knows who I am but I have literally no friends. I can't talk to people. Occured to me after nearly two years that everyone in drumline thinks I'm annoying (drumline used to be one of my favorite activities). I found out that pretty much every hangout I've been to since 7th grade I was only invited out of pity by one ""friend"". Everyone there thought I was an annoying and I don't blame them. I never have and never will be in a relationship, I will likely never have friends for the rest of highschool seeing how much I've tried to socialize to no end. I look like a homo erectus so there's that as well. My grades dropped so hard and now my parents stripped away playing instruments which was the last thing that made life bearable. 

I'm living in spectator mode, watching all of the people that I thought were my friends (who actually hate me) move on with their lives, building new relationships, going out and doing things, etc. I used to be a really hyperactive kid because of bad ADHD and now I just wear my hood and sleep in class and not say a single word all day.

I'm so fucking lonely I've been full on talking to myself and having multiple hour conversations with people in my head I've never met. My mind is acting weird it's fucking terrifying. 

Only reason I'm here and not rotting in the earth somewhere is because I haven't found anything to overdose on (powerful sleeping pills would be fantastic). I don't want pain, just wanna go. Other thing I've thought about is just driving down an empty road at 2am with the pedal floored and just waiting until I hit something.

ive lost everything that makes me happy and in so lonely I think I'm going mentally insane and I want to die every minute of my life."
990,depression,"(CW: Suicide talk, brief mention of CSA/abuse) Nearing the end of my rope","This is gonna be another one of those long posts that’ll get maybe five views and two comments, but I don’t know how much I care. It’s not like I have many people in real life anyway (especially at 1 in the morning where I am right now), so might as well just put it all out here where someone might see all of it.

I’m a first-year college student in the U.S. and I just transferred to a new school for this semester because I liked the location more. Dorms were all full when I applied, so I moved into an apartment nearby with a roommate who I don’t really think likes me all that much. I kinda get the vibe that she’d prefer to keep things as a “peaceful coexistence” rather than any sort of friendship.

To put it lightly, making friends has also been rough. I have a couple (read: like four, i counted) people who I knew before, but half of them are in different states and everyone has their own life so it’s not a perfect solution. I’m not someone who’s super confident socially, so when I reach out to try and connect with someone it can be pretty nerve-wracking. Unfortunately, it feels like every time I reach out it just doesn’t go well or it only lasts a couple of days.

One example of this happened a couple of weeks ago, at my school’s athletic complex. I was at the climbing wall trying to meet people, and I met this group of three guys who I hung with for the night while we were all there. I was making good conversation and all that, and it felt like it was going super well so I asked for their Snapchats. One of them never added me back, one of them I haven’t reached out to, and I messaged the last person once and realized this evening that he unfriended me at some point so my message went unread. That stung.

The mountains have really been my happy place since I learned to ski a few seasons ago. There’s no place like it and, as someone who doesn’t feel like they belong anywhere, it’s the closest thing I’ve got to a place I could call home. But enough exposition. Last week I asked a lift operator for her Snapchat and (to my surprise) she gave it to me. However, it got to the point where I felt like I was carrying the conversation because I was initiating everything, she’d only reply like once or twice a day, and she’d only follow-up once among other things. So today I ran into her at the resort and waved, and she reacted as I would have to someone I’d never seen before. At that point I decided to just give up on it, because, while I’m lonely and therefore more than willing to pull the weight of two in a friendship, the rejection really set in and I couldn’t make up reasons for why I wasn’t being appreciated.

Finally, I went to a bar with a friend of mine (someone I knew previously) the other night and I was actually feeling super good when I got there, but that feeling soon faded after it hit me how alone I am and how I feel I don’t fit in. It’s like everyone my age who I see has a social circle, and then I’m just…there.

As a result, I’m starting to feel discouraged from trying to reach out because it almost never works out and I can save myself the sadness and disappointment. It’s the same reason why I never post polls or Q&amp;A’s on social media. Regardless of what I tell myself, trying to engage someone always gets my hopes up that they’ll engage back and I usually end up feeling let down. At this point I’m probably a few more rejections away from just giving up and isolating myself because it’s not worth trying.

Things have kind of sucked for as long as I can remember (traumatic childhood, abuse, molestation, family instability) and I’ve been passively suicidal for the past two years straight. It’s gotten slightly worse at times but tonight I really thought about it. I started drafting the letter and thinking about how I could do it, and I went for a walk to clear my head and (after some nicotine) I still didn’t feel great, but I didn’t feel unsafe anymore. I decided to reevaluate my plan of getting drunk because I just didn’t feel like it (and I have class in the morning anyway) and I didn’t feel the need to do it anymore, but I’m really losing here. I feel like there’s only so much more of this life I can take. I wish I was one of those “lone wolf” types (assuming they exist) who doesn’t need people, but that’s not who I am. I don’t know how much more of this I can take, because everyone tells me “it gets better” and I tried to believe it, but I just can’t anymore because things have gotten worse or stayed the same for so long. I mean having hope would be nice, but I’m just running out of things to feel hopeful about. I don’t know what to do and I’m at the point where I’m really starting to care if things get better, and instead just wanting to be done."

I had no one to guide me through my formative years because my parents were just children themselves with learned helplessness, incapable of doing anything and took their anger and trauma out on me. The only brown kid in school. Dressed differently, spoke differently, was different from everyone else. Tried so hard to fit in but I felt different from everyone else no matter what. Did not help that we were poor, and my father couldn’t hold a job. We moved around so often I went to 3 different middle schools and 3 different high schools in 5 different states. I have no home, no childhood friends, no good warm memories. Just lots of yelling, abuse, bullying and trauma. I can’t even process it, and I’m turning 25 next month. Sometimes I look up my old classmates on social media (I never kept in touch). They are so happy surrounded by their community of people they have known their whole lives. Their families. Their wealth. I started working when I was 14. Took on the burden of paying bills while my father was unemployed. I’ve been working for 10 years non stop. Life just feels like never ending suffering. Even though things are somewhat better now. I’m married to a wealthy man and have new friends in another new city far from my family. I finally finished college on my own while working full time. I got the  decent paying corporate job and matured and healed from some of the horrible things that happened. But I still feel so depressed, so anxious, like life is completely meaningless. Nothing makes me happy. No happy pills, no amount of therapy. No amount of sex, drugs, shopping, tv, nothing. I don’t know if I will ever feel whole. If I’ve been miserable for 25 years how can it possibly get better. Catching up on all the things I missed out on when I was younger, and it still doesn’t make me happy."

I have a boyfriend I love and loves me dearly, and  friends that support me and make sure I'm feeling loved. But I feel devastated everyday and severely disinterested in every single part of my life. Right now I'm so hungry but I don't have the mental energy to make myself food. I enjoy food very much and I get like this often despite this. I have moments where I feel calm and content and appreciative of every blessing I have. But they're merely moments to the amount of depressive episodes I endure. Hygiene is something I struggle with prioritizing and I also find myself waiting hours to use the restroom. I make detailed itineraries of productivity but we all know how that goes. Can I please get a response from someone who relates? I feel so alone in my life and I need to feel human"
1010,depression,Not feeling anything | emptiness | and just Hollow space,"Well, always have felt bit disassociated from things and some people in general only late figure out that was battling depression and stuff later in life. My problems aren't the biggest but there's always this sense of emptiness. Somedays struggle to feel any emotions at all , it's like I am there but I am not. Somedays i only sleep through days. I'll probably delete this, would love to have some to chat and causal talk to, I'm 23 M, but then I'm the one to distant myself sometimes from people as I need my space to be me. Well it is what it is."
1011,depression,I know this will just get blended in with the other posts and be forgotten about.,"It been a very bad last few weeks. I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression and anxiety for about 6 years now. I had been getting worked up for bipolar disorder, but I changed doctors and I feel like that subject was dropped. 

I’m a medical student and finished my first semester a couple weeks ago, and I thought the rest would do me well but I haven’t been getting better.  I’m engaged and things have been going well with her, we’re looking for a place we can move in together next year which I’m looking forward to. I take venlafaxine 225mg daily and honestly I feel like it hasn’t been working. I haven’t talked to me therapist in a few weeks because she canceled our last couple of appts. I just feel numb and like I’m floating thru life now. 

I used to be addicted to adderall and weed. I haven’t used either in a while but I just don’t see the point in avoiding the weed anymore if things don’t get better without it. 

I had stopped SH for a few months and then I relapsed the other night. I didn’t do any bad damage, but I just wanted to feel the pain. I was tired of feeling nothing. 

I keep getting urges to cheat on my fiancé, snort adderall, smoke, or spend a lot of money. Just something new in my life that would make me feel something. But ultimately all of these things will make me feel worse in the long run. 

I can’t just keep doing this. I feel like I just go through the motions each day and I get no long term satisfaction from anything I do. I live with my parents still and while I love them, they stress me out beyond belief and I really can’t stand them 90% of the time. 

I just need something to change, but idk what. I want to switch my med but what if that makes me even worse? I just feel lost."

1014,depression,Depression causing bad habits,I find myself wanting to distance myself from everyone and want no one to talk to me. The site of happy people makes me annoyed and angry and im only happy when im alone and unbothered. But then I hate being alone and wish someone was there for me but I don’t want to bothered either. What is wrong with me? Is this depression or something else?
1015,depression,I don’t wanna kill myself…but it’s the only way to make the pain stop…,I don’t know what else to do…the self harm barely works anymore…I’m out of breath all the time…I can’t sleep…I can barely eat…I cry almost non stop unless I’m at work. I don’t want to but I can’t do this anymore…

I keep telling my self let’s just try one more time and it’s been killing me. I just don’t want to wake up. Please let this pain go away I’m tired of trying. But just know I really did try."
1017,depression,If i didn't have my daughter i wouldn't be here right now,"I'm really struggling mentally right now not to take my own life, my ex finace has been so cruel to me. We tried for a baby for 3 years and when we eventually have her he got worse, last month he attacked me while i was holding her and recently he's been spreading lies about me telling people i'm the maniuplator. 
He was rarely ever home after our daughter got home, (I nearly died having her she was born at 25 weeks and only weighed a pound due to pre-eclampsia) he would be out sometimes 10 hours a night. This is a man who i begged to take me out for nearly 4 years and he told me he isn't like that so he won't do it but does it for other woman.

When i met him he didn't have a life, no ID, need surguries, neglected off his mum, etc. I fixed that all for him, i bought him ID, clothes, playstation, got him his hospital appointments to get him fixed, registered him with a dentist, i bought all his family christmas presents, birthday presnts i handled everything for him. 

He knew of my past truamas with my first boyfriend beating me badly and after that my friend raping me multiply times, he knew all this and still left me to deal with everything emotional myself when i tried so hard to fix him and his family. 

But how cruel he is being to me the now is really pushing me over the edge, police are invloved for him attacking me and all of this has to go to court i don't think i can handle this. I'm trying so hard to keep it together for my daughter cause shes the only thing giving me joy. I have a great family and i'm stuck in two minds that i can go because i know she would be well loved and took care of but i don't want to put that burden on them of going through losing me and having to change their lives completely for my baby. I always wanted to be a mother, it just hurts that i feel like this so she's not getting the best from me mental."
1018,depression,"These days, I just don't wanna be looked at or acknowledged in any way","Kinda weird cuz I'm literally writing this on a public forum but I guess it's cuz I'm anonymous. Anyways

Currently, I don't want to do anything else other than look at this god forsaken screen, cry and sleep. All on my bed.

It makes me feel guilty because I do sort of look like I function normally in front of people (idek if it's something i unconsciously or intentionally do anymore), but behind closed doors, I am a mess that can but won't clean itself nor it's surroundings. It would be shameful if I just opened up a bit and was like ""uhhh yeaaaah it's all a fuckin facade i don't actually do anything all day other than draw blood sometimes hhhhh""

If you know me, don't look. I don't want you to see me like this."
1019,depression,I dont care anymore,I'm just done. If I just died I would feel relieved. It seems more like when then if I will do it. My depression has gotten so bad that everyone at work is starting to notice. And I dont even know what's causing it.
1020,depression,Can't sleep,"Usually with my depression I sleep it off. It's got to a point now where I can't sleep. I'll have the most untested 2 or 3 hours of sleep and spend the whole day feeling like a zombie. It's morning here now and it's the same thing. Could hardly sleep.

I'm on vacation  too, and I was hoping the depression  would ease in a new environment. But here I am."
1021,depression,Today I witnessed true freedom and independence and I want to live like that. Yet I can't.,"I'm currently travelling in the southern parts of Europe and today, I watched a dance troop from a remote village perform a local dance in a big city. It was true beauty. It was my life's philosophy coming to play. I experienced the true beauty of humanity. For some reason, it made me really emotional. Probably because the dancers and singers were so into the music, that they didn't care about anything else. They were enjoying life, living deliberately and were completely present in that very moment. Their smiles and gleaming eyes. They had expressions of happiness that you just cannot fake. It made me reflect on my life right now. I'm stuck in the same old rat race like everyone else. Feelings of freedom and independence are long lost in today's world. From trends to traffic, to tension, to violence and war and confusion.
We have forgotten the true essence of a wild man's dreams. We all have crazy dreams, but not everyone is crazy enough to run after those dreams. To pursue them. I watched passion and human innovation, and it deeply made me sad when I realized that the lives those dance troops led was something I wanted to do. To run free and live on the road. Share happiness and live, not for the sake of it, but to truly live and suck the marrow out of life. Yet here I am, stuck in one of the most competitive schools in an Asian country with parents who have been told the same great big lie from their friends and fathers. Taught to be slaves in a modern corporate world. I'm stuck in having to complete the tedious yet pointless duty of school and college. Running free and wild, like wild horses in grasslands and rivers flowing through mountains and lush green grasslands. That's where I wanted to be.
And yet,
Yet,
Here is where I am.
That makes me truly sad."

1023,depression,Recurrent thoughts of kms and they don't even bother me,"Hey. 25 year old M, a doctor. I have had trouble with the idea of living in the past, fell into the bottomless pit of alcohol and weed as a student, nonetheless graduated without a bump in the road and often felt like killing myself. Attempted once in a for of rage under the influence but a friend came to rescue. Abused antidepressants and anti psychotics. Never decided to visit a psychiatrist because always had this impersonator complex, feeling so fake evn when typing this as if do I have a real problem or am I just faking it. I have been mentally well from the start of the year upto a couple of months ago but the urge to kill myself just doesn't go away. Anytime I feel bad about something, my internal narration goes like ""well not for long because I am going to kill myself"". I am not even scared, I just feel like I have forgotten to feeling of a lasting happiness or joy. I snap out of happy moments into a pit of despair and nihilism in seconds. Actually I did read a lot of nihilist and pessimist literature at one point which helped me cope with the ideas pf futility of existing and help me relax but now it just seems like I don't have much time. Just wanted to share this here because I tried telling this to a few people and idk, i just feel like I am crying for attention or I get off of burdening people emotionally. There's this guy feeling of imminent end, like my mind is fixated to the idea of commiting suicide in near time. Idk what I should do. I just wanted to let it out."
1024,depression,I don't want to be autistic. I just want to be normal.,"I can't lead a normal life, I can't do anything without help, I'm overwhelmed by the smallest things and I can't make friends because of societal expectations I can't live up to.

It's also hard for me to control my emotions. I cry easily, and I was bullied a lot in school, probably because it's so easy to get a reaction out of me.

I dropped out of school 8 months ago, and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life anymore."

All the promises I made have been kept, now I can enjoy my last few weeks before the pain ends."
1026,depression,Early sign of depression,"When I was in high school I would come back from school and just sleep all day, wake up around 7pm to eat dinner and go back to sleep until the next day and still wake up tired. My mom thought I was anemic (like she literally took me to the doctor and then they said I was just fine),  but maybe it was an early sign of depression. I also always wanted to do bad shit, doing drugs. Skip school (to literally go home and sleep), I would spend nights crying in my room (thought it was teenage angst at the time.)

What do you guys think? I also had no plans for the future past HS. I ended up going to community college and then transferring to uni because If I wasn't gonna kms then I might as well not be a bum. 

I also want to discuss something else since I'm already sharing my thoughts, Does your mental health fluctuate throughout the day. Like I'll wake up in a great mood, have an awkward convo w/ someone or I'll do something stupid and then I'll literally just want to die for like 4 hours and then I'll just be fine after. But I realize now that feeling like absolute garbage and wanting to die over any minor inconvenience or discomfort is NOT NORMAL."
1027,depression,Nothing hits you more that you possibly lost your friends than the group chat you just opened and never bother to look at,"I feel like shit for everything. I haven’t done anything to hurt them but I pretty much ghosted them. They’re right to plan hangouts without me, especially since I haven’t bothered to answer. Granted I can’t hang out anyway because my whole family went through covid and my own quarantine period isn’t over yet but still. The solution is easy but I see no point. I never clicked with them and there was always something off. I never felt like a part of our group. I met them through a family business so it always felt like I couldn’t be fully myself around them (not that I even know who that is). I would rather just have them tell me they don’t wanna be friends with me anymore as opposed to feeling awkward everytime I see them. No one asks me if I’m ok but I can’t expect them to. I don’t deserve it especially since I ghosted and don’t even ask that back. I feel like ass"

1033,depression,"Dropped out of college, heavily into alchohol, weed and abusing my prescription meds.","So this has been going on since my final year at high school. I was exceptionally well in my earlier years at school so my parents decided to send me to live in another place on my own where there were good educational institutions that would get me into a top level college. But the exact opposite happened. It started with missing out classes, binging tv shows 24x7 and eventually I got myself indulged with bad company, liquor &amp; weed. Noone ever forced me to do anything it was always my initiative and i slowly had mastered this habits or i atleast thought i had. From a studious popular kid I went to a spoiled bully-ish brat and I was having a great time too. Everyone respected me when i smoked the most amounts of weed or took down 10 shots in one go. But it all went down when our college entrance exam’s results got out and my parents really got to know what was going on. I was grounded for 2 months in our home. Forced to prepare for more entrance exams and was terribly depressed at the moment which was totally ignored by my parents but eventually things got back to normal and somehow i maneged to convince my parents to send me back to the same place where i was preparing for my entrances for one more year. By the end of that year I had become a full blown drug addict and got involved with even worse company and illicit activities but still somehow i managed to score decent marks to get like a tier 3 college but my parents insisted i choose a college in my hometown which i thought was not a big deal since i would be in college but i did not realise that their supervision of me would affect me so hardly as i had been freely for almost 3 years. Throughout the first year the weed and alcohol had continued and i started missing classes here in college too. Didn’t even give the final exams too and then came the Covid. A perfect chance to redeem myself by staying at home and focussing on myself but instead what do i do? Lie about my online classes, smoke weed NOW IN MY HOME and do nothing. And by the second year of covid i had enough and my tolerance of stress levels reached a breaking point and i tried finish myself but got somehow saved and now I’m on meds and therapy but none of it seems to work so occasionally i binge drink or smoke again. But the main issue is now that my family has told me to take my own time I’m feeling more and more worthless without any motivation to do anything productive and it’s just me playing fifa all day and get annoyed at my family."
1034,depression,Don't know what to do without substances,"I've been really depressed for about three years now, since my 2nd year of college. I wake up and go to bed with this immense despair in my chest and dissociate for long periods of time. When I ""wake up"" from these bouts, I only look at myself with more guit and disappointment.  I've tried therapy for a bit through my school's counseling services but my contact in the program quit and I sort of fell off too. These days I just sit and distract myself for 90% of my waking hours. I go to a pretty good school but I've begun to fail classes in the past year and no one other than me knows. I've tried to go easier on myself and tell myself that it's ok to mess up. But I just keep losing parts of myself that I value because of it. 

I smoke a lot of weed, I'm pretty much high throughout the day, and I drink before bed every night. It's really the only thing that alleviates it for a bit. I've been home for the holidays and due to omicron I have to be here for abt 3 more weeks. I really don't know what to do if I can't get my hands on something. I've been smoking since my freshman year and it's about a pack a day so that's tough to go without too. 

Is there anything easy and soft I can do to lessen the pain without regular access to drugs? I really have no clue how to move forward from here and I'm panicking."

I have no seasoning to me and all I do is waste resources, sit on my ass smoking weed, and make shitty drawings that nobody cares about. Even my own partner feels the need to run from me these days it seems. Even on days we agree will be just for the two of us, he ends up hanging out with one of his friends instead because after a short while I bore him too much and he can't pretend to care about whatever useless shit I'm yapping on about. I'm the most boring person in the world. I never have or will utter a single original thought, idea, or sentence. I'm so boring and so lonely, but nobody wants to be around me because I'm boring.

1048,depression,"It feels like I'm struggling to be happy, even though on the outside, my life looks great.","I don't even know how to untangle it all. I just feel let down by everyone who's supposed to care and help me. Since I had my daughter last year, nobody in my husband's family really checks in on me. It's especially hard because I don't talk to my own family. I just don't feel supported. I've never felt so lonely in my life. 

I texted different people in my husband's family about how I was struggling with the baby by myself (husband was out of state for work for 4 months) and nobody responded to me. My MIL never texted me back, never called me, nothing. My SIL said she was too busy lately to talk. They all knew I was struggling with mental health and physical health problems but nobody asked me about my heart or my wrist or how I was coping with a new baby by myself. Husband came home from out of state and all we do is fight. 

I just wish I could fall asleep and not wake up sometimes. Or I wish I could wake up as someone else. But I can't because I have a daughter now. Wanting not to be here anymore isn't an option anymore because of my daughter and I couldn't ever leave her anyway. But I'm so lonely. And I don't know how to cope. And it makes me miss my mother because she had it worse than me but I can't talk to her anymore.

And my sister is in basic training and I miss her so much my heart is broken. And my favorite dog is dead. I just want my husband and I to stop bickering. I want my medication to work already.

I just don’t know what to do, I can’t talk to my family or friends because I’m supposed to be the “strong one”. My family hates any sign of vulnerability from me because I’m the oldest and I’m supposed to be the role model. I don’t know how to tell my friends I’m suffering so much and I have no other option but to continue pulling through or just give up. My cousin already committed suicide and I saw how much my family suffered including me. I hate everything about where I am and anything that awaits me. I’m just so lost and I don’t know what to do.

I am not poor ,so  I feel so bad for complaining when I am in a fortunate enough situation. But I’m enrolled in a great school that  my family honestly can’t afford, even if we aren’t poor. I’m just so afraid  that if I am not smart enough  to finish this degree that I started which everyone has already given so much money to help me complete. I hate it, but I’m so close to being done but it’s killing me. 

I hate seeming so shallow. But I’ve never felt so worthless before. I just know if I don’t finish college I’ll be worthless, even if it’s a degree in something I hate. 

I’m so sorry if this post seemed as if I was bragging about anything. I know I am more fortunate than others but I don’t know how to deal with these feelings of not being enough and I am really struggling."

1051,depression,Thoughts for supporting a romantic partner,"My (34m) partner/wife (35f) started experiencing symptoms of depression soon after our one and only kid (5f) was born. It hasn't gotten better now after a few years of meds and therapy, at least from my perspective.

She recently told me that she doesn't really look forward to anything in life. When she thinks about a family trip we have coming up, the feelings that come up are stress and anxiety. She denies any suicidal intention, is open with me that she sometimes longs for death, just to not have to deal with any of it anymore. 

She still laughs, keeps in close touch with two of her close friends, and is a BAMF at her full time, demanding job. She functions. Totally has it together, 100%, from the outside looking in.

But I feel like she has this sense of despair and hopelessness that can express sometimes at home, in interactions with both myself and our kiddo. She is still a great mom but it is hard for me to say that she is a great partner at the moment. Life is demanding and my needs are not something she has a great deal of ""space"" or ""emotional bandwidth"" for very often. At least, that is how I feel. It is all she can do to get through the day until the kid is put to bed, often. 

I am struggling lately with what I can do, both for her and myself. I know that I cannot by force of will pull another person out of a depressive state. But when she basically tells me that she doesn't experience joy anymore, I am at a loss as to what to do or say, other than to listen and be there. I want to be a support for her. A counterweight to the factors contributing to her depression. But I do not know what that looks like.

And in the meantime I have been struggling myself with a loss of intimacy, of carefree playful love, and of the sense of security of my partner's perceived happiness. And that is to say nothing of several other marital struggles we have experienced in the past few years. 

If anybody has thoughts on how to nurture a vivacious romantic relationship with a person struggling with depression, I would very much appreciate it."

1055,depression,Everyday is a New Day,"Good morning all,

I was diagnosed with Depression by the age of 20 and have been fighting it for two years. I am currently on Prozac and doing behavioral therapy. I have reached my lowest point from 2 weeks where I started to think of suicide but I am improving consistently. You can do it it I can. See your psychiatrist, communicate with those you want in your life, and eliminate others. Pick a day to do the last two and do them despite short-term consequences. It’s 2 weeks and I am better than myself in the past 3 months. I have had some suicidal thoughts daily but are fading away. 

Keep it up everyone!"

I get home and i feel this sudden sadness…this emptiness. Its like a void inside my stomach thats eating me alive, robbing me from all emotion. I go to my hidden stash because thats where i keep my depressing remedy. I pop a pill and crush another one. Snorting it till my head kicks back like that 45 my dad let me handle before he died. I sit for a good 15 minutes feeling nothing, my body is numb. I open up my phone and go to Reddit because for some reason i feel like an anonymous person reading my miserable story will help them not feel alone….. well thats all i hope YOU the person reading this does better than me i know its a shit show but just keep pushing….. 

- anonymous me"

I feel suicidal n the only reason why I've not killed myself is bcoz I'm a coward. I'm too scared to hurt myself. I hate myself, I feel worthless. I don't even know how to pick myself up n move forward. I've pushed away everyone, family n friends. I struggle with loneliness yet I can't stand people. I don't know what I've become. I'm losing whatever sanity was left in me. I just wanted to vent I'm sorry."
1060,depression,Why should I bother trying anymore? It's clear I'll get nowhere.,"I feel like such a dense piece of trash. Every time I get a new passion I fail repeatedly and no amount of advice helps. I just keep doing the same mistakes over and over. To others, it may seem like I'm stubborn and suffering from dunning-kruger. But I swear I'm trying as hard as I can. I always forget all advice and just repeatedly do the same bad habits.

Everyone says I am smart, but I'm not. I'm an idiot at everything I do. I make kindergarten level errors. There's nothing redeemable or unique about me.

I've tried and tried....but I always fail. Sometimes I have happy periods where I can pretend I'm not an absolute failure, but those pass with time.

I want to just end my life now. I'll never be good at anything. I'll never meaningfully improve. I'm too stupid to get anywhere. So why not just die and cut to the chase?"

1063,depression,I made a mistake running away from my trauma for five years and it nearly cost me my life. Living in hatred is not survivable.,"I’ve spent the last five years of my life running away from my problems. I had some very traumatic friendships and relationship end and it hurt me too much, I dropped off the face of the earth, changed my name, and spiraled into a mess of depression, self destruction and eventual suicide attempts. I just couldn’t live with what happened and what I lost.

Five years later, as of a few weeks ago, I came out of hiding finally and reached back out to those people I had just vanished on for years. It meant so much hearing how much I mattered and they missed me. And the worst one- the relationship that went south, I reconciled with them too. Having a chance to talk and apologize for our mistakes. It gave me closure for wounds I’ve let bleed for half a decade in silence.

This was the biggest mistake I’ve made, so please, consider restoring connections with those you’ve missed, do what you can to mend and forgive. Living in hate and spite is not survivable. I wish I could go back and change things. I’ve ruined my life over running from my past. Don’t do what I did."

1066,depression,"I don't know why I'm depressed, I feel so utterly defeated","I really don't know what to do anymore, I've tried everything I can do to improve myself.. I work out so much, make a lot of money off freelancing, and spend a lot on clothes and etc. But my depression and anxiety have gotten so bad due to school (I'm 18 male) and I felt like I was on the brink of psychosis and started cutting myself... Winter break has been nice to me and I love being alone yet I hate the feeling of being lonely.. It sounds so weird. I still have friends but I've slowly stopped talking to them recently because I feel like I suck the life out of every conversation and I've become more and more distant..

After my friend was in rehab for over a month due to spice and seeing him suffering from severe depression made me feel less alone. I don't know why but seeing him struggle helped me a lot. But the thing is, a few months later, even after his girlfriend breaks up with him and him failing an entire semester he seems so much happier now. HOW??? I'm still struggling every day and he just fixed his life and seems so enthusiastic and happy and full of energy now and I don't see a world in which something like that can happen to me.

Nothing traumatic or bad has ever happened to me which I am thankful for but at the same time I wish I had something that I could fix in my life so I could pretend like I'm getting better and improving. How long do I have to keep ""focusing on myself""? I've done everything I can. Even when I was in a relationship I still wanted to die everyday.

After mustering up a lot of courage I tried talking to my parents about it but they just brushed it off. The only way I believe I could improve my life is by getting treatment or medication I don't think therapy will help me personally. My life is a nightmare."

1068,depression,Is this depression or loneliness? Or both?,"I work at a hospital as a housekeeper. It's been a good place to work at to help me get through during COVID. I've been there since September of 2020. However on November 2021, three coworkers (one of them being my supervisor) transferred to another hospital. I was offered it but turned it down for various reasons. I've seen people come and go during my time there but ever since those three left, things haven't been the same. We lost a handful of employees the weeks following (for whatever reason) and we're down to the like 5-10 (including me) now and that's quite low for the second shift. I think we're losing more people than gaining. The work environment just feels empty now. I'm not very close to any of the employees including the three who left (and I'm not blaming them for what happened) but I did appreciate having company around me and I made small talk with them. Hearing them chit chat and laugh during break/lunch, walking out with them after work, all that. It made me feel less lonely but now that most of them are gone, I feel more alone and somewhat saddened. I'm assigned at the E.R most of the time and I get along with the staff there. Again not close with them but still liked having them around. I just didn't talk with them much like I did with the housekeeping staff. I've graduated before the pandemic started and I'm not in debt but this job was  just to help me get by. I think it's time I moved on and started looking elsewhere."
1069,depression,"Being near death felt peaceful, I can't get over the feeling.","So 10 months ago I gave birth and afterwards I hemorrhaged because of blood clots in my uterus. After not being able to sleep properly for the last couple of months (for perspective I slept more and better with a newborn in a cot next to me) and having a rough birth (episiotomy and forceps delivery as my labour stalled when I was fully dilated to to an Autism mental breakdown and being unable to cope) it felt lovely to just lie on the bed and relax. 

I was drifting in and out if sleep while the midwife was doing whatever, just happy I had my baby and that it was all over and I could rest. Then my blood clots were discovered and there was about 10 members of staff all flooding into the room, I was low on oxygen so they put the mask on me and they were talking to me trying to keep my conscious. I knew it was serious by the look on my husband's face but I didn't care, I didn't even try to fight to stay awake, I just wanted to sleep. The moments I was unconscious were so peaceful and painfree it was lovely and freeing. I think this is one of the best feelings I have had in my entire life, it's really hard to rank them when this feeling just feels so engrained in my head.

I think all the crazy hormones had been overriding all of this as it didn't bother me for months but recently my mental health has taken a big downturn and all the pregnancy hormones are a great deal lower as I am not doing much breastfeeding anymore. I am struggling to sleep at night and in the daytime I just feel tired and irritable. In the past I have contemplated how I would like to just be dead and no longer have to deal with depression and now I have this feeling of a peaceful passing it's just haunting me, also taunting me. 

I always wanted to have at least 2 children but pregnancy and childbirth were so awful I don't know if I can go through it again. The pregnancy hormones were so crazy and mind altering even when I was in labour I was screaming next time I wanted a cesarean but now I can barely stomach the idea of doing it all again. I am concerned that if my mental health gets worse I may decide to get pregnant again for the wrong reason (wanting to try for that peaceful passing I nearly had before) and instead be stuck going through a distressing labour and being denied a cesarean as I had fully dilated so quickly. 

I just can't sleep and my thoughts of all of this are keeping me up at night and I needed to write it all down for some reason."

1074,depression,How much of this depression is Mine and what am I carrying of yours?,"TL;DR: dealing with a split after a 4yr situationship has me questioning if I’ve always had these depressive tendencies, or am I a byproduct of a narcissist 

Hi, I (38f) have recently ended a 4yr situationship (not amicable, nor my decision).  The person relocated to an entire different continent.  This is has conjured a slew of never before experienced aftermath.  I’m 38 so this is far from my first ending, relocating either on my behalf or theirs has always been a factor.  Followed by the traditional NC.  This ending followed the same formula.  But THIS time, THIS has summoned a slew of all new aftermath.  I have accepted that I have always had mental health issues, yet was “fortunate” enough to navigate around them. I have also accepted that this emotional state is not the smartest time to get a clear perspective on my specific defectors.  

This situationship was largely based and rooted in mental health and self harm and suicide attempts (that I was never supposed to be home for, but would pop up for some random ass reason and fuck up plan).  Depression had a major authority of our days potential for what could or couldn’t get accomplished.  I NEVER seen this as a deal breaker (and not bc I wanted to save them) but bc They WANTED to help themselves, and it’s not in me to quit on ANYONE that’s wants to improve, but may need some unconditional cheering along the way.  And of course , I loved this person, but I’ve done the same thing for people I have Never had any amorous fancy for. 

 There were times this depression was a major ass inconvenience and frustrating AS FUCK!  but NEVER, did I blame or shame the person for their depression.  Never did I taunt, tease, bully, manipulate, or bring up as any form of a negative factor.  NEVER did I allow anyone else or themselves for that matter do any of those things either. And with their effort/desire for a different life, Much trial and error, and much trust / understanding; we as a team Developed some tools to help navigate through depression.  Once progress gained traction, Real Lasting Results were achieved.  

Part of me is wondering though, if part of my understanding for the situation came From Understanding.  I never really shared much of my relatability to their situation.  I didn’t want to be that person that is the ‘me too’ friend or do anything to have the focus be shared.  By all rights, I was “managing” mine and my shit paled in comparison to the volatile shifts depression would thrash them through.  And although they shared expressions of gratitude, I think it was only surface level.  But I appreciated the appreciation so I wasn’t going to shit on their expressions.  

Enter present time, they went back and forth between NC and full on engaging in conversation.  Then one day within a matter of an hour and a half, they went complete NC.  Which I respect, (honestly) as part of their reason for leaving was to HEAL.  And I can understand keeping communication with me I’m sure muddles this process.  Then after 2 weeks or so, I came across a post where they were completely shitting on me (with fabrications on top of that) ON A POST THEY MADE about missing me.

I privately confronted them.  And have let it be.  But my current brain space has had to acknowledge some things.  1) I said I understand his choice to go NC, so the following statement SHOULDN’T matter.  (but there are a lot of things not mentioned that lead to there needing to be a follow up to my previous statement).  2) I WOULD BE HURT AND SAD BY THE NC, but I would RESPECTFULLY understand and deal with it, knowing it was part of the process.  as NC is to preserve one’s mental fortitude and is necessary at times.. however ..the silent treatment, is VERY different (in my understanding) as it’s a weaponized withholding of love/affection for punishment.  ummmmmm, I’m currently confused on why I’m not just able to take this L instead of being furious at the situation.  I’m confused on if I’m angry bc this is intentional hurt, bc the “managed” grip I had on my mental health issues wants to give way but I’m not confident in my own self cheerleading skills, or if I’m becoming depressed and self doubting as the result of dealing with a narcissist.."
1075,depression,Envy and exclusion,"Lately, I’ve felt displeasure a lot in the last week. I came home for the holidays only to realize it’s not what I thought it was going to be.

Out of the family, I feel that I’ve been given the short-end of the stick. I haven’t cut myself in 3 years and tonight I had the thought. That’s why I’m here. I feel the need to get high and relapse. My freedom has been restricted and it has made me feel so upset, I have grown numb. I just want to feel pleasure and no more pain. Self-destruction isn’t the answer though.

It seems like no one wants me. I'm so alone in a sea of people. Every day I wish I wasn't born, I've struggled and continue to struggle. I can't talk to anyone and no one is there for me.

This is a small victory for me. I couple years ago I thought I was going to end it. But know I feel ok with my physical existence and experience.

1087,depression,"22M, out of college, very much want this to end","Broke up with my college girlfriend back in August and I have been blocked off for about 3 months now. From hindsight I was gaslighted during my relationship when my ex would blame me for the reason why she had to abort our accidental child. I “manipulated” her into getting the procedure. In especially the month of October I pretty much felt dead inside and I would literally visualize like her, a makeshift child, and myself. It was fucking horrible. Afterwards I was dealing with obsessive thoughts about my jealousy on what she was doing and if she was moving on and whatever. It fucking sucks because I work a sales job so at the same time I’m forced to act joyous and happy in the day time when internally I genuinely want to end it all. Hearing my housemates have sex literally reminds me if my ex is having sex with someone else. If I walk past by a couple or if I see a food place we went to, I immediately think about my ex like instantly. The topic of sex, intimacy, or coupling just makes me so jealous and sad. If I find casual sex with a girl, I immediately feel empty right after and think about what my ex is doing. I’ve been working out so much and I’ve been looking a lot better and I go out in the day and I smile like everything is okay. My friends knew I was depressed before but now they think it’s all alright. In reality I genuinely want to die. Sorry this was a long rant. I hate the lifestyle my housemates live of just hooking up and partying. I’m over that now I wanna do real stuff. Point is I’m very very lonely I just want a hug man, I wanna stop having an unhealthy relationship with sex and jealousy feelings, work is getting stressful because I need to hit my Quota, I’m just so annoyed and tired all the time. The only time I’m happy is in the gym. God I hope this will pass, feeling like this since august and it’s gotten worse every month.

Which usually leads to me sinking as low as I can go. 

I don't know what to do anymore, maybe I'm not trying hard enough. I get stuck in my head and just think about everything and start to hate myself. I have no friends to turn to, my family doesn't understand that I'm drowning in my own thoughts and emotions and I'm struggling to stay afloat.

I want to get better, I want to make friends, I want to find love and be loved. But I feel like maybe I'm a lost cause, like maybe I was destined to die a long time ago but somehow managed to stay alive so I'm just this shell bobbin in the current of life."

But I will never forgive them for ruining my life. Their hatred for my sexuality has made me never trust anyone. Their love for me was conditional, even though they didn't realise it. And because of that, I will always be broken.





So, fine, you're a better person now and you deserve your praise for improving. But you weren't the right person when I needed you to be. I was a child. I needed you to love me unconditionally then.

Man it's been 2-3 months I'm being depressed and just living on pills , I've so many problems which make me think its pain for me as well as burden for my parents. I tried overdosing once but nothing happened that night , but when i unconsciously did it on the day our bus almost got into accident during day , i wasn't feeling ok and there was a chance i had died during the school hrs. Usually i get panic attacks due to anxiety I've  many times i got hospitalized also on the day when i poisoned myself but it was in 6 times lower in amount so somehow i managed to survive. The only thing i pray from god is just take me out of this painful situation somehow ,i don't want to be like this. Today my whole body is hurting like hell maybe cuz of that accident aah... I need to be freed from  this pain."

1108,depression,The empty is worse than the agony,"This has been a bad year for me, which is unfortunate because the year before that was bad, and the year before that was bad, etc

A few days ago I had one of those days where all you can do is cry and it feels like someone drove a hot iron through your chest. And I remember in the middle of sobbing I thought this is so much better than the empty. But not even the agony lasts long, and now I'm empty

I'm going between trying to look at Reddit and staring off into space. I don't have any hobbies anymore. I can't do anything. Nothing does anything for me. Every song sounds bad and bland, movies and shows disgust me, there is literally nothing outside I can even imagine doing. Even now, reddit has just about lost it's easy dopamine hits. I have no urge to do anything at all, I just want to stare into space. 

Why would another person even want to be around someone as toxic as me anyway? I am a vacant void. I will just suck the light out of any room I'm in. I'm sure empty and there's nothing left for me. I can't cry, I can't move, I can't do anything. Totally empty. Basically just the background character to someone else's story"

I do 3 therapy sessions every week, but idk if ill get out of this depression sinkhole :("
1110,depression,"Welp, burned another bridge","I've cut ties with people I cared about in the past, whether for my own sanity, or by scaring them away. But I guess I've yet to learn my lesson, because I lost another one tonight. And it still hurts as much as all the others.

They say it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all, but in all honesty I kind of want to just not care about others anymore. Too much pain that way."

1113,depression,How are people happy?,"I’m so confused. Especially in a “post”-pandemic world, how do people live happily? How do people still get excited about things and look forward to doing stuff? I haven’t felt happiness or excitement in so long, and I thought other people felt the same way since last year but I guess not."
1114,depression,finding resources for help fight depression,"i do not have money for therapy, so i would like to know of ways to manage depression. maybe someone can say something i haven't heard of before. i also recently just got out of a breakup and its been a couple of months and i still cant stop thinking about them. its affected my ability to think and even talk to other women (as if i was super slick before) but life'sbeen weird. anyone relate??"
1115,depression,How can I make myself cry?,"Please, I just want to have a dramatic, cathartic, drunken-like cry.

I’ve grown numb and become too good at avoiding my triggers and facing my emotions, all I do is escape and ignore. Though I’ve always had trouble with crying. Except some rare days-long episodes, but that’s neither here nor there.

I got a few hours before I have to go back to real life and see people again, please, recommendations to help me cry? Thank you."

Just adding on to my suffering constantly. I don't know what I did so wrong to deserve this. I post about my awful abusive relationship to get my stress out, and considering how horrible my situation is every day, I don't know why stupid little shit has to happen too. I feel like someone's set a curse on me, or that god just wants to see me suffer. I can't think of any way out any more."
1123,depression,I don’t like music anymore,"As the story goes, according to my parents, I could sing before I could talk. I loved The Little Mermaid as a baby and before I knew how to say words, I would sing her songs. Music was my whole life, I wrote my first song at 9 and I kept writing and learning and playing. At 15 I had my tonsils removed in a surgery that scarred the back of my throat and essentially took that gift from me. I kept trying. I went to a performing arts high school and did hours upon hours of vocal training and it never came back. I carried on, knowing that it would never be what it was, but I needed to keep doing it for myself. It was how I processed emotion and feelings and it maybe wasn’t very good, but it was still cathartic. 

Over the last few years I’ve seen every creative interest I’ve ever had just… drop off and cease to exist. I have hundreds of books that I can’t stand to read. I have art supplies packed up in a box I can’t bear to open. My piano sits covered in dust in my living room, and I can’t even lift the cover.

I don’t know who I am anymore. The world has strangled all the beautiful things out of me."
1124,depression,life sucks,"don't even know what to do anymore. i constantly feel like no one genuinely cares about me. absolutely hate trauma dumping on people or even telling them my problems because i don't like being a burden. ive lost the motivation to do anything and i don't even know how to ask for help. parents dont believe in mental illnesses, they've never seen me cry outside of their divorce, and i just don't like showing that i'm sad. my 'close' friends are becoming closer to one another while i'm left out because i don't have the energy to socialize with anyone anymore. gave up on my college applications and only submitted one because i didn't want to be a financial burden. i live with my mom, and she's never home because she constantly visits her boyfriend in new york. school and work isn't even my escape anymore. every check i receive is spent on clothes or video games. ive lost the bond i had with my close cousin. no one actually asks me how i am anymore. they only talk about their problems. i'm just so tired. there's no meaning in life for me anymore."
1125,depression,I feel trapped,"I just don’t know how to tell my parents how I feel. I don’t want to cause other people trouble, especially with everything going on in my family right now, and starting college has worsen it so much. My motivation to do anything has hit an all time low, I just feel like quitting, but that would cause a lot more problems. I know that if I don’t say anything things will most definitely get worse, but I don’t feel that they deserve to have more problems than they already do."
1126,depression,The only thing,"I find it pathetic that the only thing keeping me here is that I don't want to make my family sad. I don't want them to mourn for me. If I could die without anyone caring or noticing, I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

This makes me feel pathetic because even when I'm breaking down and my heart feels like it is being torn to bits, the only thing in my mind is what other people might feel. I can't even just focus on my own feelings for one fucking minute. I'm constantly thinking about the thoughts of others. Wondering if the random person I made eye contact with at the shop was silently judging me..

I am coming onto here as a last resort. I'm hoping that by typing my feelings out I can find peace with them. I had a journal I kept, but my boyfriend sat reading it and laughing at what was written. He doesn't understand what I'm feeling. He thinks it's an excuse to stay in bed all day or to eat junk. 

Anyways. Here's my first post, it was a bit of a feelings dump with random shit. I guess the main focus is that even when I want to fucking die the only thing I'm worried about are the thoughts of others. Does anyone else feel this? I feel so alone."

It's like I want them to be happy, I just feel like a spectator to everything. They are in relationships, partying and having sex while nobody gives a shit about me. I have to worry about physical illness and dying a painful death. My dad even one day said I might even wake up blind...why do I have to suffer, why can't my old bullies suffer who made me suicidal."
1128,depression,So fucking tired,"I’m so fucking tired. Depression affecting you physically and making you feel like you just did a million tasks and ran a marathon even though you did absolutely nothing except sulk all day is the worst. I wish I had energy so badly. I just feel so tired. Dreading work and errands tomorrow because I feel like my body is just so burnt out. It’s a chore to do anything, even walk to do anything like go to the restroom or grab a snack."
1129,depression,What keeps you going?,"As the title says, hope to know what keeps those who have depression going? 

Just having a hard time finding the motivation / meaning in my life. I’m only 18 too and I already feel like I’m just not cut out for this world. I feel like I’m too weak for the “real” world and just find it scary and hard. 

What’s keeping me going is my family but still, there’s those days I feel so down and not wanting to wake up :("
1130,depression,post-episode,After a depressive episode does anyone else look back on it and it feels surreal? like it never happened to where it feels like a third person point of view? and you then convince yourself that you forced yourself to feel those emotions and seeking help would be selfish of u? kinda like imposter disorder. :/
1131,depression,I don't know if I want to kill myself.,"Everyone I know would benefit off of my suicide. I don't have any friends that aren't tied to my relationship, my parents are so frustrated with me (and rightfully so) because I can't get my shit together, my boyfriend tells me that he hates me and wishes that I wasn't around very often, I stress out my teachers, I give bad advice and I even burden people online with my problems. I hate myself so much. I'm a horrible person. I lie, I steal, I manipulate and then play the victim after. Obviously there are people who have it worse than me, but I'm fucking suffering every single day. There is no escape, I'll never be able to end my life because I'm too selfish and too fucking scared. I've created this mess for myself, I was bullied all through school and I guess I'm taking out all of the anger and sadness on people that really matter. The only person that I treat properly is my awful abusive boyfriend, even though it has never been appreciated. I wish I was anyone else. I don't know why things turned out like this. I don't know if I want to kill myself, or if I just want someone to see that I'm scared and suffering and lonely. I wish I wasn't such a pussy."

I’ve tried making friends and I try talk to people but none want nothing to do with me. I’m the kid that sits by himself at lunch and doesn’t say a word so nobody wants to be associated with me. The past week over break I really haven’t done anything besides work (which I do all alone) and sit in my dark room. I’ve pretty much stopped eating, I wake up and the taste of food makes me feel sick, all throughout the day I don’t have appetite for anything and every time my parents try to talk to me I just get so annoyed and end up storming off to go be alone. I know they mean well but I just snap and don’t know what’s wrong with me. When I lay in my bed I genuinely feel nothing just numbness. I don’t want to end it but at the same time I don’t want it to go on anymore. I just want somebody to pay attention to me and just give me a chance."

But of course, I can't tell people that. So I have to lie. I have to pretend that I am normal and have a life. GODDAMN IT, I AM SO SICK OF IT! I hate this. I hate work. I hate society. I hate expectations. I hate people. I hate everything, including myself. Actually, I hate myself the most. It is obvious that I'm the problem here. Killing myself would be the right thing here.

1141,depression,I’m too overwhelmed and it doesn’t seem worth it.,"
I have a lot of past hurt from people I love like my sisters who are my life. I live for them and it’s sad they bully me to the point I can’t think of myself in a positive way. Parents have high expectations that have crushed me I never feel like I am enough for them. Don’t have many friends because I have traveled all my life first time I went over seas I was 5yr even at that age I basically left everyone I loved other then my family. I would meet a friend get close then we would travel again and I would never see them again and that’s the pattern of my life . I have been depressed for 4 years and have had persistent thoughts of suicide for 2 years. I’m not “smart” but I’m homeschooled and my mom is a terrible teacher and doesn’t know what to do with me because I’m VERY dyslexic so I can’t learn shit and you will probably notice I have really bad grammar. So I would give my 100% for my parents to call me lazy. There are so so many thing I’m supposed to do but I don’t want to do anything I just want to stop hurting. Recently it has been so bad I feel like the only way to distract my mind is a razor blade. The world is so overwhelming so many things I “have too do” and I can’t. I can’t face my parents again and have them tell me how I should feel and how shellfish I am when I stopped living for myself a long time ago. I’m 14M and I can’t go a minute without wishing I wasn’t born. I haves never actually attempted but I have gotten really close. I don’t want to die but this hurts to much."
1142,depression,Heavy marijuana use ruined my life,"I was a student, in high school not doing great, not doing terribly, but i was doing okay. Then I discovered smoking with some people who just wanted to use me because I had a house they could use where I was alone on the weekends. 

I stopped paying all that much attention academically. I started just focusing on smoking. I finished with middling grades and then took two gaps years where I just smoked and worked a bit. I then went to Højskole where I also mostly focused on smoking and having fun, alone or with a few friends, in my room. No parties, no socializing, in the most important part of a young mans life, another regret. I met an amazing girl who was visiting from the US, but I could still only focus on smoking and not see how amazing she was. 

Then the pandemic began and she was sent home to her own country. I came to visit her, but I bungled it up big time, because I mostly just wanted to smoke and couldn't see the forest for the trees. I fucked it up so bad with both her, and her parents. You wont even believe how big time I fucked it up. 

I went back home, we broke up. I continued my education to become a teacher, but I mostly just did that so I could continue smoking and read a bit, but mostly smoke. 

Now that vie stopped smoking completely, after 5 years of heavy using, I completely hate my life. I lost my chance with the most amazing girl in the world. I lost my chance to get a good education even though I have a good head on my shoulders. All to this, god, damn, plant! 

I thought the plant would help save me from social situations, but it just stopped me from growing and kept me stagnant. It has ruined my whole god damn life and I cant see a way to pull back up from what has happened. I feel outside suicidal and I want to end it because I cant see a way that I can achieve a life that I would enjoy without smoking now. I want to be a doctor, or a lawyer, something that makes sense and is meaningful, but the god damn plant has ruined that for me. 

I want to be done with this existence, because this is too much. It makes me so sad how much I ruined everything for both her, and for me. This is all too much. I want to turn back time, but I cant. This is just too much."
1143,depression,Depression with psychotic features,"I hear things, see things, and oftentimes believe what I sense. When these phenomena occur to me, they’re not witnessed by others. I see different colored orbs of light, I can smell things others can’t, which can be funny, but it concerns me. I’ve heard voices of course. Strangely these voices are all different. I’ve had dreams that come true. I’ve spent some time locked up, which kept other people from thinking about me, but it didn’t help me. What has helped me the most, is living subsistently and making extra money for cash. This very controlled and monitored society is diametrically opposite of what I’ve learned I require. My symptoms have calmed some since I spend more time alone doing meaningful that requires learning."

It got bad when I was 25 after I had my baby but now I'm in therapy and have been on meds for over 2 years now. I know medications aren't the cure all for depression, and they did take the edge off but lately,  idk if it's with the holidays coming or what, I've felt more depressed than ever. I've surpassed the sad and angry feelings of the past prior to medication but instead I'm just almost like defeated. I just dread every day and just want to sleep all day every day. I barely want to eat most days and normally force myself. The days just go on like im on autopilot. Like i blink and it's night time again. I'm still able to push myself to carry on with my daily responsibilities and routine, but it's a struggle. Idk I'm pretty broke too financially and with Christmas coming, that's making me feel even more depressed.  I haven't been able to afford it for the past few years. I'm just dreading it all. Dreading the monotony of everyday life. So yeah I just want to live in my dark room every day but can't. Anyone else feel this way? I'm just venting I guess. Looking for some solidarity or insight."
1146,depression,Dysthymia - High Functioning Depression Experiences,"I have functional depression. I use 100% of my daily energy to complete my demanding job. What is left I dedicate to parenting.

I have no energy left for anything else which means:

1. I only clean my house on the weekends because I don't work weekends and have more energy. This takes up both weekend days.
2. I rarely cook for myself and eat out or pre-made food all days.
3. When an unexpected crisis happens I have no energy to deal with it
4. Exercise makes me physically exhausted
5. I am always in reaction mode, I don't have enough energy to be preventative
6. I experience anhedonia on a daily basis
7. I am motivated to work only by the thread of being fired/eventual homelessness
8. I see my friends (those I have left) about once every 3-4 months because I need my weekends to complete livings tasks and weekdays I'm too tired.

It used to be better. I used to have energy to exercise, but it's gradually gotten worse over the years rather than better.

Anyone else want to share their experiences?"

1150,depression,I'm just gonna say it,"The reason I'm suicidal is because I feel as though I failed at life. Everytime I ever felt that way it was because I felt I had failed. And while many times I felt that way and was able to bounce back. There's always something else, something new to believe. This time things are different. As I've failed the most important thing of all. Being a father and family man. I couldn't make it work with the mother of my children. Things have spiraled so badly she's even pregnant with our thrid child and we have zero communication. This unstoppable feeling of failure. This no re-thinking this. This was my life and that was supposed to be my family but I failed. My choices and decisions in-between has led to this crumbling family structure. A family structure I cannot accept. It was my life to craft and this is wrong."

And sometimes this dependence isn't received well by her parents who belong to the generation where you must move on. 

I understand that therapy and medication is an option but due to her personal experiences, she is unwilling to start that. 
I am afraid that once her parents, who aren't exactly understanding of her mental state, get frustrated and ask her to live on her own to learn discipline and whatnot, she might become even more depressed. 

How can I help her as a friend? Is being strict a good option here? I have tried doing that and she gets either angry or sad. Sometimes she says that she isn't dependent and it's just because others are ther for her that she acts the way that she does."
1153,depression,Depression and the body and a small balloon of sadness,"When depression gets really bad, it gets particularly physical, embodied. I don’t just mean tired, heavy arms and legs. I mean this sensation, a foreign object that feels like a ballon has suddenly installed itself under your rib cage, the pit of your stomach, and it’s full of a kind of sand esa that it light, like air, but takes up space and leaves you short of breath sometimes and you just want it to go away…"
1154,depression,any advice for someone’s who’s treatment resistant ?,"I have had severe depression and mild-severe anxiety since I was about 16. Was falsely accused of rape and my life has just spiralled ever since. 

I’m 24 now and the only relief I’ve had in that time is the odd day here and there where I can keep my head above the water for more than what feels like half a second. 

I’ve been on multiple anti-depressants, I’ve been off anti-depressants, I’ve kept a good sleep schedule, I’ve been to therapy for multiple stints, I’ve exercised, I’m in my last year at uni and just got some good grades back, I have no trouble with and am generally good at public speaking, I have a lot of friends, I have a great best friend of 20 years, I have some good people in my family (dad used to beat me when I was younger but we’re mostly good now), I’ve tried meditation, I’ve tried ignoring it, I’ve tried facing it, I’ve tried all sorts of techniques recommended through CBT sessions, I’ve tried illegal drugs that supposedly help, I’ve removed caffeine from my diet, I’ve moved to a new town, I’ve moved back home, I’ve had multiple girlfriends and have never had trouble with women, I’ve talked about it with friends and family. I try my best to live every day to be a good person and genuinely do think I’m a good person. 

Despite all of this, nothing offers any release.

Last year I came close to suicide but I’ve managed to stave off doing that since.

Before things take a final turn, is there anything else anyone can recommend I try? I want to get better, I’m dying to get better, I’ll try anything, it’s just that nothing works."
1155,depression,I feel like I'm constantly chasing a high I will never get back,"It's overwhelming knowing that I'll never enjoy life as much as I did when I was a kid. The music, memories, everything was just so perfect. But now nothing has the same sparkle as it did. This was only a few years ago, which shows how quickly everything went downhill. Nostalgia sucks"
1156,depression,Ever Revolving Door,Life is just this ever revolving door. This vicious cycle. I can change things and change medicine and change habits. But no…. It just goes right back to that fucking entrance to depression. I can’t get away from it. I can be happy or content and then I slowly go back to it. I don’t want to be that person. I don’t want to be that way. I’m tired of it. I’m so tired of it.
1157,depression,Probably gonna die soon,"I thing this is it.

Ive had my depressive episodes several times before. But this is the worst. 

Ive lost appetite.
Cant enjoy anything without my brain telling me Im a piece of shit every 2 min.
Havent showered in two weeks.
Have been locking myself in my room for the most times these past 3 weeks.

Im still a bit scared, but Ive decided to do it before the end of this year. Hope it'll go smoothly. Dont want to end up in the hospital afterwards."
1158,depression,Should i just give in to my suicidal thoughts,[removed]
1159,depression,There is so little left,"I do have some hope left, but it's completely irrational. I am incompatible with the expectations placed upon me and demands needed to survive. I have lived longer than I could hope for but I'm just waiting for the next bout of happiness to come around. I spent the whole day making sure everyone around was happy while I tear myself apart inside and have no hope for the future outside of the extreme short term. My current situation is bad, and I have no energy or ideas on how to fix it because I have kept making it worse for a year. I may have to end it soon but at least I am looking forward to something tomorrow so I might be able to pull through."
1160,depression,i want to go home but i cant,"im a week away from finishing my first semester of college and i haven’t felt worse in my life.

while i was in college, my mom sold my childhood home and moved to hawaii. which should be exciting, it’s hawaii. but i realized that i’m in no way connected to my hometown anymore. my parents don’t live there, my brother moved out a while ago, ive basically committed to living in my college town for the next couple of years, there is no home for me to go back to.

I always said that i wanted to leave, and now that i have i don’t know what to do with myself. I feel so stupid for wasting the time i had left there. at the same time i feel so stupid for missing somewhere so unremarkable. there’s nothing left for me in my hometown but i still cry about it. i dont have the time or money to go back and visit, and even if i did i doubt i’d enjoy it. i just don’t think i like the fact that i am fully disconnected from an entire chapter of my life.

winter break is coming up, which at my school lasts a little over a month. everyday i get closer to it i feel worse. more anxious, every little thing is overwhelming me. i don’t know how to talk to anyone about this, because, realistically, spending a month in hawaii should be better than going home. and yet im still unhappy. 

for the record i do have depression, diagnosis and ssri’s included. i feel like this is like exasperating everything just a little bit more. i also don’t have anyone else to talk to"

1162,depression,Just how I was feeling tonight. This isn’t usually me but I wanted to get this off of my chest. So hello strangers. This is new to me.,"Finding your place in a world that never stops. At times you are at your lowest with random curveballs that seem to only pop in at the times you’re most at peace. For some reason you have made it through some very low lows and felt nothing was looking up, now you feel like you’re on the cusp of finding your place. It feels as if any day something is going to pop out at you and change your life forever, if only it had your name on it, a sign saying choose me and your wildest dreams will become a reality. Somehow you have gotten to a place where money isn’t tight, you have everything you truly need and more. Yet content is the furthest thing from your mind. You still have this gut feeling someday and someday soon you’re about to have a huge change for the even better. You’ll never know it until you take the risk of trying, or even searching for what it is. You have no clue yet you know it’s right there waiting. The thought of going out of your comfort zone frightens you and enlightens you. You want to change everyone who knows you’s perspective of yourself, but you don’t want to lose them. You don’t want to be a sheep you want to be a Shepard. You’re stable but feel below your peers and it eats you from the inside out. Why can’t you be “the guy” or even viewed as someone who could potentially be that. People seem to have think you are at your peek but inside you feel there’s so much more to yourself. Why can it look so easy to others what you truly want to be. You have a vision of yourself and don’t know what actions to take to make you look and be seen as the person you want to be seen as. You’re not a bad person, you’re not seen as a bad person. But you’re also never taken seriously and it’s because you don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings. You’re a pushover at best and can’t take the actions to change into what you want to be. But why? What’s stopping you from changing into the man you want to be? Validation is more important to you than the bliss of emotional freedom, you can only control what makes you happy in life but you’re too busy trying to make sure everyone else’s lives are perfect. Why? What causes this for you? Is it truly childhood trauma? It’s hard for you to grasp that seeing the things you saw as a child, the feelings you had, and the way you were treated can really dictate who you are today. You know if you want to change who you are it is ultimately up to you. You just have to force your subconscious mind to agree with you, but how? How do you rewire your brain to make you into your vision? You’re handsome and intelligent but that’s not how you’re viewed. You’re seen as goofy, dumb, emotionless. At times you don’t feel like you’re seen as human as everyone else. You’re just existing in a space where others can easily overlook you and you feel distant at times and just want to be alone because you feel you don’t fit in. Why can’t you make it?"
1163,depression,I cry uncontrollably at night and I don’t know why,"I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression and am currently on Lexapro, and throughout the day I’m usually alright but as it gets later into the night I find myself getting suicidal and very sad, sometimes to the point where I’m silently sobbing as I lay in bed at night.

Not just softly crying but aggressively crying to the point where I have to try my hardest not to make any noise which would wake up my family because I just want to scream and let it all out.

I try and distract myself by going on Reddit or watching YouTube but it doesn’t get rid of the immense pain I feel late at night.

I’m just wondering if anyone else feels this way? Could I be bipolar?"
1164,depression,I’m in this solo dolo,"And it’s killing me.
I have no friends and no partner.
Nobody to talk to, chat with.
I guess, I’ll die alone.
Fuck this bullshit.
Being in the middle of Europe and even in middle age sucks.
Let’s play Valorant and pretend I do something valuable."
1165,depression,Depression has fucked up my memory.,I fell like depression has completely ruined both my short and long term memory. I can't remember things I was thinking about litterly like 10 seconds earlier. I also can't seem to remember things long term either. Not even the years before I became depressed. It all just feels like some kind of fog. I feel like my life is being ruined by me not being able to remember things.
1166,depression,I just can't get better,I don't even have much energy to type. All I know is that I hate everything this world has to offer and don't want to be here. I've been up and down and up and down. When can I just be normal? When can I get out of bed without going back to bed 2 hours later? When will I be able to stop myself from missing out in life? I hate myself.
1167,depression,There's no point,This is like the hundredth post I've made. So pathetic... I give up.
1168,depression,One thing I've noticed from being badly depressed...,Is that the same type of people who would make a post on every social media platform professing their lack of knowledge of your mental state are the same ones who will blow you off when you think you can reach out to them for help.
1169,depression,Rant. I need to get some things off my mind.,I am just so sick of people. I'm fucking sick of myself. I hate myself. I'm do nothing for no one and I'm just a leech. No job no money and a bunch of shit I need and have to pay for. Then when you're to the point where you've been suicidal for months and it's like wtf. I even made my therapist cry. I just give up. People say talk but it doesn't help or do anything. Anything you say they will minimize. Suicidal for this reason and not that? Not good enough. No one likes me. I pushed them all away. I dont talk to anyone. They don't even care anymore.
1170,depression,I hate my body,"I wish I could just stop existing, people at school have said that i look like a rapist as if that was just some funny joke. I wish I could cut up my face beyond recognition, or claw out my eyes so I don't have to look at it. I'm obese and I have ADHD, in other words I really want to do work and workout but I just lay in my bed until I fall asleep. It's hard to just do things, I hate my body. I hate my voice, I wish I couldn't talk. I know it sounds stupid, all of this does. But my voice is obnoxiously deep, and I'm still trying to figure it out but I know I'm not cis. I wish I could just stop my ability to talk. I've thought about just stabbing myself in the throat, but I don't know how well that would work. However if it did work It would either make me mute or kill me and I can't really complain either way.

I'm 14, feel free to say I'm too young for any of this, I'm fine with more reasons to kill myself. Feel free to call me a dumbass too trust me I know."
1171,depression,Too anxious to stay alive,It’s 1 am and everyone is sleeping… a conflict happened in which was resolved easily through talking but I’m still left rattled and uneasy… i fucking hate having mental illnesses. I can’t sleep and have to be up in 4 hours. My stomach hurts and is churning  and I have too many health problems and too much anxiety about everything ever. I really don’t think I was meant to live this long.
1172,depression,I just want to die,"I feel guilty every day because I feel like I've failed my family. I'm a university student and my parents are helping me out even though we're poor, and I'm not doing so good academically. I have a lot on my shoulders and I just want to rest. I thought things would get better once I got into college, but it's the same shit, except this time I have to pay. So now I'm just spending more money taking classes that I'm failing. I have to act as if I'm okay at home, but I'm not. I can't push myself academically anymore. I know I'm just whining and complaining when everyone has worse situations than me but I can't help feeling this way. Some days I'm happier than others, but I know I always go back to feeling sad and unmotivated. It never changes and I'm tired of existing. I wish I could die of an illness so that no one thinks my family failed to raise me. I've thought of just killing myself in some random area my parents will never be able to visit so that they never have to visit the site of my death. While it is expensive having to pay for my funeral expenses, I know it will be better than having to waste money on their useless child every single day that I continue to live."
1173,depression,Always Depressed,"I am a 61 year old married man. I have been married to a wonderful woman for many years. A few years back, we moved from Florida to SC to, help out my Wife's now 94 year old Dad and, He is driving me completely crazy. To start off, let me say that I understand about old people &amp; their habits but, what he does makes ZERO sense. He hasn't the capacity to drive anymore so, we take him where he needs to go. Right before we got here, his central air/heating unit broke &amp; we can't afford to fix it. So we purchased window a/c units and, heaters for the colder months. We chip in for bills, so I don't have a problem with that. But, that's where the nice part ends. On the hottest days of the year, he was shutting the a/c units off, the ceiling fans too because, (as he puts it) there was no one in the room. It's hot as hell &amp; he shuts them off. Last month I took them out because it had gotten cooler out. Enter the heaters. We have two. One for the living room &amp; one for his bedroom. We're never really cold enough to want one. The trouble is, he seems to think that, he needs to crank up the heaters constantly when, it is 70 damned degrees out! He completely messed up the electrical outlets in the living room doing just that! I see no reason to have the living room one on at all, when he is in his room much less cranked up so high that, the outlets get red hot. I agreed to move here &amp; help so, that's on me. But, it's making me nuts. We can't go anywhere without him &amp; can't leave him alone for an extended amount of time because, he cannot walk well and, falls quite often. No matter how much we tell him, please don't go outside Dad, he does and, takes a chance of falling on the concrete porch. It's like dealing with a 94 year old, bratty, kid! We don't go anywhere or, do anything. Our love life is non existent and his habits are utterly DISGUSTING. The man consistently wipes his nose with the back of his hand at the dinner table &amp; insults my cooking by choosing frozen &amp; jarred foods over my homemade. Our children and, sole Grandchild live in different places with their respective spouses. One in Florida, one in N.Y. and one in N.J. We can't even make plans to go see them because Dad can't even make a 20 minute car ride to a fucking store! He rudely and, constantly interrupts me when I am in the middle of speaking, repeats the same boring shit, day in, day out and I have to eat it. I am beginning to resent him. He signed the house over to us last year and, is always telling us...THIS IS YOUR HOUSE NOW, CHANGE WHAT YOU LIKE. Then, complains when we suggest things. I am so damned depressed about this bullshit. Basically because I feel trapped. Why? Because he is giving us a house with a 70 grand mortgage attached. I have to swallow everything because of this shit and, I'm mentally, physically &amp; emotionally exhausted. Every time I mention anything to my Wife, we have an argument. To top it all off, two weeks ago I got a kidney stone and, the fucking thing won't pass! I've been on pain meds and, they make me feel shitty but, I have to take them otherwise, it's the worst pain ever. So, that's it in a nutshell. Maybe it isn't as depressing as some would think but, isn't feeling trapped with no way out enough after awhile? Peace out and love to all."
1174,depression,I just don’t know anymore,"This year has been rough I guess but mostly on a person to person level like I fell out of my most real relationship I ever had we were even about to get engaged and then one day she just told me she didn’t love me anymore. So I lost the love of my life, and that hurt a lot. I’m honestly still dealing with that pain and I’ve tried to go on dates but nothing feels right anymore. Now however I’ve had to have a friend break up, my best friend of 4 years and his gf and myself all moved into a place and from day one anything that was negative was my fault. The person that I knew as my best friend has changed so much in the last few months that I don’t even recognize that person anymore so we got into a huge fight and now I don’t see us ever trying to reconnect. Things we’re said on both ends thatll keep it that way. I guess what I’m trying to say is the two most important connections I had in my life are gone now and I have no one now I just feel completely alone."
1175,depression,Suicidal because of a crush. Wtf is wrong with me.,"Basically I was trying to flirt with him and he told me he wants to flirt back but flirting causes him to fall in love quickly and then he told me he’s not ready for a relationship because it’s bad timing.

And now it’s been 2 days since we talked and part of me wants to believe him but part of me thinks he’s just saying that to reject me nicely.

And tonight I was cutting my thigh with a blade and thinking of him while I did it like wtf. What is wrong with me."
1176,depression,(19M) Ive been trying to cope with fact I got my girlfriend (22f) pregnant,"I just don’t know what to think, it’s been 8 weeks now I’ve never felt this down and out before and i don’t think it’s ever going to change. I moved out for the first time in may I can barely afford my half of rent. I don’t know how I’m going to bring another life into this world and not even know if I can afford formula or diapers. I knew life wasn’t supposed to be fair but I honestly don’t even have motivation to be a father. I had so many aspirations to be something in my life, I feel like all that motivation I once had switched to a cold depression. I had so many examples of who not to be from uncles, aunties, hell both of my dads haven’t even been in my life emotionally. I just feel like I’m at a crossroads. To the right I have clear path on being a family man, being the father I never had, and on the left is just nothing but emptiness."
1177,depression,Sometimes I forget I need air.,I hate my brain. I remember when I used to be happy and I didn’t question it. Now I get so unexpectedly sad I hold my breath and my heart feels like it’s going to break in half. It’s easier to pretend nothing is wrong because I don’t even know what’s wrong. My family is very loving and supportive but I don’t want to drag them down with my unstable moods. Everyday my heart hurts for no reason. Sometimes I feel so overwhelmed by everything around me I shut down completely and forget that I need air.

Recently it feels like this boat that I call my emotional state has been sinking really low. I just spent the last hour being in a really bad mental state and I feel like if I dont try something now then I could just break down.

So now that that's out of the way, does anyone have a resource I can use for someone I can talk to when I'm having one of those moments? I'm not looking for an emergency line or anything, more like someone, similar to a counselor, that I could reach out to for over the top moments like that.

I dont know if there is something like this, I just don't have anyone to talk to and especially during those moments I feel super isolated like all I can do is just feel hopeless and alone."
1181,depression,im scared,im not sure if i have depression. but im definitly suicidal. right now im fine a bit bored but okay. but it changes so quickly and so drastically with no warning at all. one moment im regular and the next im thinking how to kill myself the fastest. but im scared im just being dramatic and wasting everyones time being on here. ive never tried to actually kill myself. the closest i remember was when i was looking for my moms gun (im 12) i couldnt find it so i just quit. because i knew other ways to kill yourself were less likely to work. almost everyday i just get this blast of feeling like a useless piece of shit. am i just being dramatic?

1183,depression,Feeling conflicted,"
My therapist thinks I have PTSD and I was diagnosed depression by my doctor. So I don’t know, I open up more to my therapist than my doctor. 
I have flashbacks of my bad childhood and severe anxiety even when interacting virtually, unwanted thoughts; disturbing thoughts, not wanting to hang with even close friends and just not interested. Trembling as well.

I am depressed but I feel so conflicted when a person says to me: “Why do you LOOK so depressed?”. And that person already knows I am depressed yet continues to ask me for some reason, they asked me in hallway at school where a lot of people could hear. 
I could be making it a big deal but it is a big deal for me. I don’t know what to say when they ask me that, they also tell me I received bad genes, I play it off cool and laugh. I feel more hurt because I’m born from my parents, it’s like theyre insulting my parents.

They also smacked me on head really hard while walking in school. I instinctively hit them back and the person fell, I remember being really upset and just unwanted thoughts pouring in my head. I felt dizzy and sick later. 

I play it calm and cool but internally I’m just having disturbing thoughts like wanting to do this and that to the person, I feel ecstatic when thinking like that and then I feel so guilty and sad because even if they insult, they still have their life and it’s theirs. 

I sometimes end up thinking about it and end up crying for a few minutes before stopping and just staring off somewhere, I stop crying as if I never cried and enjoy my day. I also think it’s because of my eye bag that makes me look depressed, it’s just the “why do you look depressed” makes me furious. 
I didn’t tell the school because I believe it’s just a small deal in general and I, me, being dramatic. 

Sometimes people tell me things will get better and me being me, I get my hopes up and believe it will but it doesn’t no matter the number of people that told me it will, no matter how much the pastor prayed I will. 
After time I grew sick of hearing that it’ll get better, I felt sad and then angry. 

I even left behind the desperate young me who wanted affection and someone by my side, it was unintentional. I was so stressed and felt hopeless. 
I decided to join Reddit and share my thoughts. 
Feel free to share your experiences below and virtual hugs needed at this moment, a virtual hug is enough."

Tired of faking a smile,  and hoping no one sees passed the part of me that enjoys making people laugh only to notice the darkness that lingers around me because I can’t trust anyone enough to let them see that side of me anymore. I just want the thoughts in my head to end."
1186,depression,I graduate college in 10 days.,"

Time and time again, I’ve convinced myself I’d never get this far. I went into college during the worst depressive episode of my life. SH, insomnia, isolation, constant suicidal ideation. I’ve been working fulltime since I started college, and pretty much have been in a consistent burnout for 5 years. I was poor, I was living without running water. I couldn’t afford groceries. My family was falling apart.
By the time I finished my first semester, I had a date, method, location planned. I had convinced myself no one would care that I was gone. That no one saw me struggling so they didn’t deserve to mourn me when I’m gone. I attempted but was nearly caught by someone before I could go through with it fully.  No one even knew until recently. I was going to make it look like an accident. 

A few weeks after my “attempt” a work friend of mine was brutally murdered. It feels odd to say she saved my life, we hardly knew eachother deeply, I had zero profound impact on hers. But seeing her family mourn her tragic untimely death gutted me. I can still remember what her fathers cries sounded like, and she was twice my age. I told myself at her funeral that I simply wasn’t allowed to kill myself. She had the ability to live and raise her daughter stolen from her, it felt like I’d be doing wrong by her to forfeit mine. 

So I began the trials of enduring. Deciding I wasn’t going to kill myself didn’t make my mental health any better. In fact it got worse, many times. But it did get better at times too. I forced myself a babystep out of isolation, and my partner and friends pulled me the rest of the way out. I developed some half-decent coping mechanisms, I got better at vunerability and communication. But even with a loving partner supporting me, and trying to work on myself, I will eventually spiral back down into the dark. Into not doing my assignments, calling off work, letting the dishes in my sink rot, not brushing my teeth. A constant cycle of shame that builds exponentially upon itself. But in order for it to be a true cycle, it always has to come back around. 

I am officially 10 days from graduation. I think my freshmen self would be surprised to see me here. I’ve come to terms with the fact that I am mentally ill. My happiness and ability to function exists as a cycle, and in order to survive I have to accept the fact that I will spend a lot of my time enduring instead of enjoying life. But it’s an objective fact that I have the capacity to feel healthy, happy, and alive. Because I’ve experienced many fleeting moments of it over these years no matter how poorly I took care of myself, or how heavily I leaned into the darkness. No matter how bad it’s been, it’d be a lie to say it hasn’t gotten easier to manage. I’ve been reflecting and I wanted to share some of the things that have kept me here. 

* Try to reverse the mindset that it’s “always going to get worse again”, . If you have the ability to feel depressed, you must have the ability to enjoy yourself as well. Everything in life is cyclical.

* Heal your inner child, talk to yourself and nuture yourself like you’re taking care of a child. Would you hit a child out of frustration? Would you neglect feeding a child, or force them to live in a filthy environment? Would you shame a child for their emotions? Of course not, so don’t  allow depression justify this abuse towards yourself.

* Find an unchanging reason to hold on. This one isn’t easy, and flexible reasons are fine too, but you want to have something you cant let go of. 

* Have back up plans instead of suicide: Psych wards and therapy are obvious and effective, but if you’ve exhausted them already or don’t have access to them, have some impulsive change planned to scracth the itch of self destruction without ending yourself. Get that tattoo you’ve always wanted, go off the grid and live off the land, buy a plane ticket to anywhere and explore. It is so easy to isolate yourself, but even if you hate the life your living, there’s got to be something more interesting than just dying. 

* Acknowledge you are ill. I know this one seems obvious, but for me it took me a long time to distinguish between shame and bitterness. I was bitter other people around me seemed to have it easier, jealously is a normal emotion. But the shame i placed upon myself for missing classes or school, not cleaning, having loor hygiene, etc was SO signifigant and made things so much worse. These were all symptoms of my illness.  A deaf person would not get mad at themselves for not being able to hear someone who continuously tried speaking to them and getting them to listen. They would be mad at the person not acknowleding their need for accomdations. It is not our fault the modern world does not accomodate our illness. It is not our fault we struggle, and it is natural to be jealous of those who don’t. 

I believe with the pressure of school out of my life, I may just be able to have proper time to start healing.  But I will be mentally ill regardless, and I am okay with that now.

I mean it genuinely feels like I'm being overloaded by nothing surrounding me. Which I know doesn't make any fucking sense but that's just how it is.

It's torture. I'm fucking stuck here lol
1189,depression,An increasingly strange feeling growing with time,"Been increasingly going through this feeling that there is something not right

A constant anxiety/dread/unhappiness/ zipping through days/ filling days with power point presentations on mindless things, lot of regret, reminiscence bygone days, jumping into/out of fleeting -superficial relationships (for unmarried ones), not finding interest in routine work, feeling stuck, in the same-loop day in day-out.

Anyone else feeling the same? is this mid-life crisis/depression? What is the way out?"
1190,depression,I still just feel so defeated,"Everyday I try to convince myself I’ll be okay eventually, and every day it’s becoming harder to do. 
My heart, head and body are so drained, my heart aches every day and I just don’t want to feel this anymore. 
I want to be here for my wife and son, but I have no clue how much longer I can hold on. I sit here at work, typing this with tears in my eyes wishing I was stronger than this."
1191,depression,I can't find any meaning in life.,"I've been taking medications for 3 months, I don't think they are working. School is distressing me, and I can't set myself a goal to keep me moving. I am really tired. 

I can't find a meaning to keep going, I don't have any motivations and the only thing I do all day is sleep. I want to do something, I don't know what, but I can't stand living like this anymore. I don't see any meaning in life, though. I have to study all these years to get a job, work for other few years and then die. This doesn't feel right. I don't think this would be a good life.

I don't have anyone, I can't enjoy anything and if I do it lasts only a little bit. I want to be happy, I want to impress other people and I want to have energy to do that. But I don't have any, what should I do?"
1192,depression,I'm tired,"I'm a woman. I'm 21 years old, my step-dad sexualy abused me since age 7. I finally decided to tell my mom at age 12 and my mom forgave him. He blamed me and continued to abused me physically, emotionally and mentally.  He had beaten me so many times that I was so scared of him. He was possessive and aggressive. I have 2 smaller siblings and I'm scared to death every time he would beat them. I finally left home at age 18 and moved in with my husband. He is kind and loving. But since giving birth to my daughter I have been thinking of taking my life. I have tried 4 times already including times when I hit myself when my depression hits harder. I'm not the beautiful young woman I used to be. My belly is full of strechmarcks and I'm heavier. I don't recognize this woman anymore. I don't like this woman anymore. I just feel so disgusting. I know for sure I have postpartum depression and anxiety.  I feel alone nobody in my family cares.  Nobody wants to help me . I knows how much I'm hurting.

1195,depression,I'll be 30 in a few days and I couldn't be sadder.,"30 years old. I just want to be 16 again when I was able to go to football practice and hang out with friends all day. Walk around town seeing who's all outside and decide what we want to do for the day. Not having to worry about who has a better job and who can afford to go out. We just hung out and did things that were free and loved every minute of it.

Anyway, I'll be 30 with no friends, no life experience, no job, and knowing how much I'm missing out on in life. The sad thing is I don't really mind having no friends. I enjoy being alone, but it does get lonely. Maybe if I found that one person that enjoys being alone together. In a perfect world that would be great, but I know I don't make a good friend. I don't enjoy many things, I don't drive, and I don't really want to spend money (mostly because the little bit of money I do have, I save, hoping to eventually have enough to buy a house for me and my family). As much as I want someone to be alone, together with, I know it wouldn't be fair to them."
1196,depression,i'm not okay,i'm not okay at all. i feel so fucking bad and no advice from the internet like spending time with friends is going to help me because i don't fucking have any. i'm going to commit suicide it's just a matter of when
1197,depression,I just woke up from a dream I would’ve never wanted to wake up from,"For the past few years, I’ve somewhat-consistently had this overwhelming issue with loneliness. I never really feel a great connection to my friends, and I haven’t had a significant other in about 2 years. For context, I’m 19 years old now, in my second year of college. This evening, when I was asleep, I had a dream that placed me in my utopia. I was walking on campus with my dream person, we were laughing obnoxiously. We just had a prolonged hug as we were waiting in line for something, and it just had all kinds of things like that. I woke up in the middle on the night about an hour ago, only having had about 2 hours of sleep, and I’m so incredibly depressed. In reality, I don’t really talk to anyone on campus, and I don’t have a car to leave and meet any other people. Has anyone else had this experience? How do you get rid of these agonizing feelings?"

I miss my mom giving me a hug and my dad waking me up for school. I miss it all so fucking much. I miss my ex so much too and I want her back. It’s been so long and if anything I’m even more sure now that she was the one for me and that i made a mistake that will impact the rest of my life. 

Thing is, my sister committed suicide and I could never do that to my parents or family a second time. It’s not that I want to die, I don’t. I just feel like I used to have the greatest life ever and being back in those days is really the only thing I can think of that would make me happy. 

I don’t want the future. I just want to be with my family and with my ex and just young and surrounded by loving people all the time. I moved across the country after the break up and I am alone here now. It will never be the same and that is what kills me everyday. How could I ever be as happy as I was back then?"

I want to ask you guys if anyone feel like their depression comes in long waves instead of a constant lingering thought.

I've had depression since 5/6 years ago, i think i'm at a much better situation now and was able to come up to terms with a lot of stuff that made me depressive, however, since 2 years ago i started noticing that, it all comes crashing at once roughly twice a year, each episode being stronger and longer than the last one and most of them had no trigger for it to to start...

No one decided to be my friend. Even my roommate moved out lol. It's halloween weekend and I can hear people partying, and I'm sitting here trying not to end it all right now. I have nothing to look forward to but toil. I have thoughts at the end of the day and no one to share them with. And I live in a never ending gallery of examples of people who easily accomplished what I completely failed at. I knew it was gonna be this way from even before I showed up here. I'm utterly useless as an independent person; I can't motivate myself to study, to shower, to brush my teeth. Some days I accidentally miss lunch and dinner. I don't see any happy ending for myself."
1207,depression,Whats the point,"What’s the point in living if you are a useless cunt that can’t do literally anything?

I go out all the time to escape the boredom, the loneliness, and quite frankly to distract myself from my thoughts of how useless I am, especially fine motor skills wise.

Then I go out and can’t do any common sense stuff there either so it just reminds me even more. I can’t do such basic things like hold a pool stick not like an idiot. Stand up straight (I went gym for a year and couldn’t do the form right on loads of stuff so barely progressed).

And both my parents tell me to fuck off. That I’m not wanted. So I move into my aunts/uncles. And they take care of me, appreciated, but they are really just using feelings of guilt for my situation rather than genuine feelings of care about me. For example, the only thing I’ve ever, ever succeeded at were GCSE/partly A level exams and. Aside from my A* in English they were still mostly only B’s (not a big deal in English schools as grades are calculated on an average not a set percentage).

I have (I think) severe ADHD making me unable to focus on fucking anything. I also have extremely bad anxiety making me focus on this non-stop, if I phrase one word slightly wrong I’ll overthink for an hour “are they annoyed at …” etc. I have no hobbies, a shitty minimum wage job for now. I’m 21 fair enough but it seems all too late.

* Ugly as fuck, been called it whole life
* Lonely, no ever experience of ‘talking’ to any female
* Indecisive and can never make mind up
* Auguslll
* Envision what I want to be but can never become it
* Terrible posture, skinny (now skinny-fat), no muscle
* Cannot brush my hair properly: scary, horrible teeth
* No life skills at all, can barely cut a slice of cheese
* No idea of direction in life, temporary job on low wage
* Virgin
* Disrespected by friends who use double standard/assumptions on me or other ones who use me for access to going out ventures because no one else will invite them out

1209,depression,what gets you up every morning?,please answer this question for me
1210,depression,I don't know how to improve my self-esteem. I keep focusing on the past. (Requesting Advice),"Alright, I feel better now.

But when I was feeling bad, I typed my thoughts out to clear my head :

Couple things about me : I'm ugly, I'm dumb, I'm socially inferior, I have bad character, I'm a failure to my parents given how much better my brother is than me.

I'm ugly - when I was young (elementary school), I used to be excluded bc people considered me ugly. In fact , people were even embarrassed about even interacting with me. Later on (junior year high school), I decided to ask for people's true opinion on the internet and got a lot of harsh comments. Stuff like I'm 3/10, I look like a man despite me being a girl, and that it's over. I also later learned a lot about lookism. I was surprised by how dark the mindsets of incels/redpillers are toward women.

I'm dumb - I struggled every year to stay in my school - from elementary to middle school. Teachers were threatening to kick me out bc of my grades. There was a teacher that tried to make sure I didn't get kicked out, but when he left in 5th grade, it was highly likely that I would get kicked out, but my dad spoke to them to make sure I don't. Some kids and teachers judged me for not understanding concepts. I could not get into the high school or college I wanted. I actually didn't get into any high school until my dad talked with them. In arguments, he used to use both of those against me to remind me that I'm dumb.

I'm socially inferior - I did not have friends from elementary school to 5th grade. I had friends from 6th to 8th grade. They badmouthed me for my hobbies (I liked anime at the time and they thought it was childish and they liked stuff like marvel). They also made fun of me about my anxiety. I was like a joke. That's what allowed me to make friends actually. Ton of them would lie to me that there's a test/work that day just to make fun of me stressing out. I then became invisible/ignored in high school. I had friends, but I didn't ""belong"" in the group. I was just there like their last option.

My dad also verbally abused me since I was 5 - things like telling me to kill myself and that I'm a failure, etc etc. I used to cry and my mom would make me feel guilty for crying like she thinks I'm making a big deal over how my dad treated me even though I was/am very much miserable. Yeah, and ofc my dad would yell louder and tell me to shut up if I cried in front of him. Bc I knew I couldn't express the anger I felt toward my dad to my dad, I would get angry at my mom. I would be very irritable. My mom and brother would say I am a bad person. In junior year, my relationship with my dad got really bad. He would physically abuse me. The first time, he jammed his elbow into my arm and I got a purple/green bruise. I told him and he never apologized. My mom didn’t care either. After that, he would punch me in the head. I always felt a sort of fight-flight response with him bc I was terribly scared of when he was going to jump at me and punch me in the head. He was an unpredictable person. Sometimes, he was nice. Sometimes, all of a sudden, he'd just get angry over little things. He had broken plates and smashed home phones. My brother also recognizes he has a major anger problem, but bc my brother is much older than me, he was able to leave home and go to college and later get an apartment.

I've always been compared to my brother. Outsiders looked up to him and looked down on me. They treated us differently. Like people were glaring at me and parents were asking him how their kid can be like him. He got into a better university and was/is the president for some non-profit organization. He is doing well in his career and has leadership skills.

I've always felt unloved, worthless, and lonely. I've had trouble making friends and when I went to summer school in a different state during high school summer, I was miserable. No one would reciprocate despite me making an effort. I was too embarrassed. I was too embarrassed to eat alone in the dining center, so I would rarely eat. My stomach would growl in class, and I'd feel embarrassed. My mom also only gave me hotel-sized soap and no shampoo. I only realized till later about the major mess-up and that I should have gotten more products. I thought I wouldn't need a lot bc it's a 2-week program. I felt so miserable about my appearance that I just didn't want to go get hygiene products from a store outside the campus. I would just lay in bed and stay stuck in my room. I kept the room really messy.

Although it was only a 2 week experience, I think about it from time to time. It was a very miserable experience. Now, I'm in my first year of college, and I have put more effort into cleanliness/grooming/dressing properly/keeping my room neat etc. I try to eat more too. But I still feel the fear.

Now, bc I'm living at the campus, I don't have to deal with any sort of drama with my dad. But what's happened in the past still affects me emotionally.

\--

Idk if I stated things clearly. It's just my mind keeps ruminating over negative memories of the past and making me feel I can never change and that I'll always be worthless. I feel pretty guilty about having bad character. It's just my self-hatred leads me to feel bitter/angry/distrustful of others. I also feel apathetic and self-centered. Because I think so much about myself and whether others will judge me, I don't feel empathetic toward others. I'm not a genuinely kind person. My self-esteem affects my energy and body language. I want to get along better with others. I also have the external locus of control mindset. I feel life happens to me not the other way around. I have worked hard in the past, but my goals were not achieved. I have felt immense disappointment, so I don't hope for anything anymore. I accept I'll continue to be a failure. I feel that genetics plays a major role in intelligence. I do study, but sometimes I do it passively bc I feel hopeless. Also, lack of energy from the constant negativity in my head makes it hard for me to actively learn."

1212,depression,Terrified but trying not to be.,"Very recently I left my husband of over 6 years due to sexual assault. Wasn't the first time but was finally ""strong"" enough to do it. Now I get to fight a deep depression episode and not freak out about the future. Or to not go back and continue to be silent just to make everything ok. My depression and anxiety has caused me to overthink everytime I had ""big"" emotion. Was what I feeling justified or was I over reacting? On top of that I have such little self worth that the thought of ""self compassion"" with my therapist makes me have a minor breakdown. I'm 30plus and have two kids under 6. I have changed everything for them. All I want is the do the best for them."
1213,depression,Mentally old,"My grandmother always told me before she passed on to never grow old and stay young. Now bear in mind this coming from an 80 year old woman doesn't seem like much, but in the years since she's passed I understand what she meant, and now it's too late.

Quick example, everyone is all in on hallows eve (Halloween, the parties the costumes everything. I haven't cared about Halloween since I was a kid, I just don't get the obsession, it just seems like a waste of time. I've been to a couple of Halloween parties sure but I haven't done anything during ""spooky season"". Just seems like a lot to fuss about nothing.

Bear in mind I say this and I'm 26. I've never been into the party scene never been out in the deep or have been really social, but it really has taken a tax on my mental health over years and years, which briefly stopped a couple years in a row but now that I've moved to a new place those old demons are coming back and feasting.

To anyone reading this, don't grow old mentally. Grow up but don't grow old. Life is too short."

1219,depression,Goddammit,"I graduated high school recently and I'm going to do my final exams in less than 2 weeks and I couldn't help but feel like shit on my grad day and still feel like shit now.

I will start off by saying I was a very social person until last year until I was basically kicked out of my friend group for doing what I thought was right. I really only have less than 5 friends now and basically haven't gone out to socialise in the last 2 years. I guess I was in a depressed state for a lot of the time over the last 2 years but school and exams have taken my mind off of it and I naturally gravitated towards doing somewhat well in school as some sort of relief for my state of depression and to kill time however as school has now ended I can't help but feel uncertain about the future and furthermore be depressed about my past. Over the last 2 senior years of high school I have basically lost all the relationships I made (unwillingly) and become nothing more than a shut-in who watches random videos on the internet while occasionally putting pen to paper. 

I never thought I would be the one suffering from depression (my mother has depression and to me it always seemed like it was due to a lack of ambition) but now I realise it really can be due to anything. Its been so draining and tiring that I can't even study without being extremely depressed about my life. I have zero motivation and it just sucks that I probably won't be in contact with the people I grew up with in high school. I have had suicidal thoughts left, right and centre and I even pretend to talk to my past self about what I could and should have done differently to retain my relationships (it's sort of a coping mechanism). I really don't know what to do and my life just feels like it's spiraling downwards at an accelerating rate, I really don't understand the point of going to university and I'm not sure if I will ever be able to make friends again. I haven't talked to my family about this and I don't plan on talking abt it at least until after my final exams as my parents have invested a lot of time and money into my education and so have I. I don't want the only thing that has kept me out of basically ending it all to become worthless and so the only thing I'm doing as I type this out is studying."

1225,depression,What my dad said to me tonight,"I've had diagnosed clinical depression for around 7 years, so a good portion of my life since I'm 18. My dad has always been a prick about it. 

I've been put in various therapies and on various medicines, but recently a private hospital I went to helped me make MASSIVE strides in recovery. But as many people know, even when you're at your healthiest, you still have depression. 

Tonight I opened up to my step mom and dad(drunk) about suicidal thoughts and ideation. My step mom is a nurse and had very good questions, we had a very healthy and rewarding conversation. My dad ignored most of it, came and sat down when my step mom went to the restroom, looked me in the eye and told me:

""You think you're the only one who's been suicidal? Everyone has been. I was suicidal when I was in my 20's"" 

Everything shattered. I LOCKED my eyes with him, and told him to say it again. He did. Immediately fighting or flight kicked in, I backed away from him uncontrollably crying and waited for my step mom to come back out, and told him to repeat it. And he did. With confidence. I looked at my SM and started hyperventilating.

He started saying something and before I registered who he was speaking to I was already RUNNING up the stairs, blocking my door with a chair, lights out and forcing myself to be silent. 
I realized at some point in the trauma response I grabbed and brought the dinner I had delivered up with me at and started eating, so immediately I had a distraction, thank god. 
(I was heavily abused by my alcoholic mother, that's what triggered the trauma response)

My dad is a narcissistic entitled white man with a god complex. I know this, and I know he's a cunt when he gets drunk. Earlier in the night he said ""I didn't say you could speak"" when we were debating some shirt design and I immediately snapped back with the ""I don't need your permission to speak"" and he shut up real quick. 

I know he loves me. I know he's trying, and he is putting in effort. But this one thing he said while drunk will set me back for a long time. And it will probably take many months to a year for me to open up like that again to anyone. 

I texted my SM to let her know I was in a safe condition and wasn't collapsed or suicidal, and that my door Is blocked and will be blocked until tomorrow morning. 
She responded apologizing for my dad, and telling me she will explain what he said to me when he is sober. 

So...yeah. I have work tomorrow. So that'll be fun. I don't have anywhere else to go. I bounced between my parents to try and escape the other but I won't be ""safe"" until I can afford to move out. I work minimum wage and I've been rejected almost 47 times now.

I dont know why my parents think its okay to abuse me, despite both being told their abusive, threatened with law, and recommended therapists of their own. The world is funny that way.

(Note: I am not currently in danger, suicidal, or in need of legal assistance. I just needed to vent, because I don't have any real friends.)"

1229,depression,Advice on Doing Basic Activities Again?,"I’m seeking advice on how to get myself to start doing things again. My most recent bout of depression (sparked by full covid lockdown and my mother being really ill/almost dying) has made it so it was all I could do to complete my assignments for uni (with many extensions). I had no energy left to do anything else or see anyone. I’ve barely left the house these past two months, probably only once in the past 5 weeks. 

Now that I’ve finished my courses, I know what I need to start doing to move forward. I need to get outside, get some exercise, see and talk to friends again, etc. but I honestly have no desire to. If anything, I have a desire not to. All I want to do is sleep, lie in bed, and occasionally scroll through reddit or watch Netflix. 

How do I motivate myself? I’ve tried breaking it down into small steps but even walking to the end of my street doesn’t seem feasible (even though I’m physically able to). Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I’ve been in therapy consistently for the past year and a half and I don’t feel like I’m getting much out of it anymore. I’ve been in and out of therapy for the past 10 years and I’ve reached a point with my last two psychologists where there’s nothing they can tell me/suggest that I don’t already know. They’ve basically said so themselves (it helps that I come from a psych background myself). I’ve also been on a variety of antidepressants with varying degrees of success.

I know what I need to do to move forward but how do I actually go about doing it?

Also should probably mention that I have no family even remotely nearby (they live overseas) and only a few weak friendships locally so I don’t have any close contacts who can help me."
1230,depression,i miss home,"i hate college. i want to go home so bad. i want to just hug my parents and go on a drive. 

i woke up this morning and starting sobbing immediately because i had a dream where i was at home so when i woke up i got scared because i didn’t know where i was. 

my chest feels so heavy and i just want to cry all the time. i don’t know if i can do 3 more years."
1231,depression,I am so done,"I literally am unable to have friends outside of secretly hiding some at school from my mom. I cant hang out or do anything (before y’all fucking start I can’t do anything I’m a minor and if I could I would have done shit already if I leave I will get called in as missing and get a beating.) 

My grades has gone to shit, I literally won’t be able to graduate. I need to so I can at least be able to get a good job to pay for plastic surgery to at least look better but no I just have to have crippling depression. I have tried losing my weight and never succeeding because I go straight back to self loathing which leads to binging. 

Holy shit I just want to be skinny, have a social life, get good grades and be able to actually feel loved and supported my my family but no I just have to be the one to have to release my trauma and break the generational curse. I am truly broken if anyone had the guts to love me an ugly person like me they would be dissatisfied because I truly don’t think I can express anything other that sadness anymore."

1234,depression,Seriously just going to kill myself,"I don't care anymore, nothing fucking matters.

No friends or anything, try talking to people online and they ghost me, try talking to people in person and they seem so uninterested i just stop.

I can literally scroll for almost for 3 full seconds through all the people who ""wanted"" to be friends, the page has to load twice to even have them all on screen.
And trying to talk to more people just adds to the list as no matter what they just stop responding randomly or slowly just ignoring me while being clearly active...


I hate myself, I'm ugly, I'm stupid, and it's been proven to me time and time again I'm not worth anything at all.

I hate being alive so much it hurts, talking helps but now it's like I just worry every message is the last one they're ever going to send.

Nobody will read this either I know, I guess I'm just typing this because it use to help foo.

I don't want pity, I don't want anything anymore, there's no getting better, and I'm just going to die like this and literally not even knowing what it feels like to hug someone lmao 

It doesn't matter anymore, the only thing giving me literally anything to keep going is dumbass fictional stuff...

I'm just gonna end it, soon I don't care anymore, I'm tired"
1235,depression,Taking sertraline now and experiencing side effects,"Specifically feeling loopy. Like I'm floating or aware that I'm me but also feel like I'm not inside my body. I don't know. It feels weird.

I can manage the nausea, drowsiness and dry mouth but I'm kinda anxious about feeling loopy since I've also experienced this when I was taking pregabalin for anxiety and it scared me so much.

Is this normal? Any tips on how to manage feeling like this? I'm still in day 3 of taking it. I know I have to wait at least a month to see the effects. Just feeling really anxious coz I don't want to feel worse than I am already."
1236,depression,why having a hard time making friends is even one of my problems??💀💀,"I used to be an extrovert and always had always surrounded myself with people and because this pandemic I’ve totally changed and I’ve tried everything and many times to gain friends again and open up but nothings works and no ones interested in me anymore. I was never a loner and never had to deal with something this, I have food and money and good grades why tf do I have to deal with social anxiety now wherever I go and belittle myself in every situation.  I feel ridiculous . I just end up embarrassing myself whenever I think I have something good going for me with someone , as if I’m being punished💀"

1238,depression,I am tired.,"From the bottom of my heart, I am tired.

I am tired of trying to perfect things.
I am tired of stressing over things that are out of my control.
I am tired of stressing about everything.
I am tired of worrying.
I am tired of having no motivation to do the things I need to do.
I am tired of having no motivation to do anything at all.
I am tired of dealing with these thoughts.
I am tired of dealing with this body.
I am tired of showering and taking care of myself.
I am tired of obsessing over my weight.
I am tired of feeling fat and ugly.
I am tired of worrying that I am not good enough.
I am tired of loving people who will never love me back.
I am tired of being lonely.
I am tired of sabotaging my relationships. 
I am tired of trying to change.
I am tired of feeling all of these emotions.

I am tired of being human. I am tired of being alive. I am tired of everything.

I don’t want this anymore, but I don’t want to end my life. I just want to be put in a sleep without end, and dream about what I want."
1239,depression,I will be graduating next semester with an engineering degree but I feel like a failure and a loser.,"I just want to rant. Might delete it later. 

I (21F) will be graduating next semester with an engineering degree and a decent GPA. I may have done well in my classes and academically but I feel like a biggest failure and loser. It’s getting hard to pull myself together. 

I was a loser in high school as well. Thought things would get better in college but Covid made it worse. I have received nothing but rejection in my life; rejection from internship, rejection from jobs, rejection from relationships (I got rejected on January when I confessed to a guy I had crush on. He gave me mixed signals. Thought he liked me but guess not), and rejection from self. 

Next semester I will be graduating with no job, no experience, no internship, no friends, and no boyfriend.I don’t even have any close friends or relatives to share my thoughts with. I have tried talking to some of my closest friend/relative but i have either been judged or called as dramatic/cringe. 

And the scar of being sexually abused multiple times by my own cousin at the age of 14, keeps hitting back. 

I currently work at retail and it makes me even more depressed. Slowly losing hope in life.
I try to make myself strong but it’s just getting harder and harder. I have no motivation to do anything anymore."
1240,depression,There’s always the empty feeling left at the end of the day.,Do you ever have days where everything is great and you're excited and engaged and like your actual self and then that kind of drifts away and disappears as the evening comes and then it's fucking 1am and you feel mediocre but you also feel bad for feeling mediocre because you have no reason to fucking feel mediocre.

1242,depression,What if I don’t love anyone in this world?,[removed]
1243,depression,When you have realized that everything is pointless there is no way to go back.,"Most people believe that depression is an irrational feeling that comes from chemical imbalance or traumatic experiences. That if you improve your life you will see things different. And if this doesn't work then a pill will solve your problem.

But I don't feel this way. I feel that everything depresses me, everything to my eyes seem bad. Relationships, families, society everything. Sometimes I feel I'm envy about things but then I think if I would be really happy if I had all these things I wish for. And I understand that I wouldn't.

I'm tired of life. Not about my own life that it's objectivly crap but life in general. Life is unfair, is cruel. Nobody has values or morals or goals everyone tries to find easy pleasures just to cope. Others like me just live in their misery completely isolated because they can't fool themselves. Others are still ignorant, try to be the best people, follow the rules and be hopeful. I'm jealous not for theur life but for their ignorance. They are not aware.

I don't want to hear crap anymore ""that life is difficult but has good times"", ""life is supposed to be harsh this is how we learn"", ""if you are a good person and treat other with the respect you want them to treat you, you will receive what you deserve"", ""sooner or later everyone will take what they deserve"". 

Enough really. I don't expect all my life be full of rainbows but seriously why to continue? To find a miserable job, doing a miserable family, living a miserable routine and feel happy that I will go to a crappy place for the weekend? Or partying all day, dying drugs, sex and not have a goal or a dream to follow? Maybe I'm weird, maybe I ask too much. Maybe what I want doesn't exist.

Life is not a movie. OK we get it. But if is not a movie why to stay here? To suffer? Since my life will never be how I dream it why not just go? Why to be saved?

I don't want to be fixed. There isn't anything to fix. I don't have problem with who I'm. I'm just aware that I don't fit in. And not for the reasons you think."
1244,depression,Why is it worse at night?,"I don’t understand. Why is my depression worse at night? I want to sleep, but the thoughts in my head don’t let me. Or I don’t let myself. I don’t know. I don’t want to keep relying on alcohol or pills to knock me out, but it’s getting harder to resist.

Sometimes I feel like I’m locked in my own head. It’s me and this brain 24 hours a day. I cant run from it or tell it to stop. I just want to be happy and free from it.

Does anyone else suffer worse at night?"
1245,depression,I'm being such a hypocrite,"I'm always pushing my friends around and talking over them. I will get frustrated if they cut me off in a conversation but then I start talking over them.
I don't know why I do this.
I know I do it when I do it but I can't seem to stop myself. I'm an impatient person so maybe it's because I have to wait for them to finish??
I feel like they can't share how they feel about what I do because it's just become normal. I want them to point it out. But I know that if they do that I'll feel even worse about myself.

I wish that I could just stop. I don't know why I can't. I've lost friends because of my behavior. I don't know who to ask.
I've never actually opened up to someone. Nobody knows how to help me stop because I never share anything. I don't feel deserving of any sort of help I guess. I feel like I should just waste away.
This is all affecting my performance at school too.

I just want HELP. I can't seem to accept it though. I want to treat the people close to me with respect and fairness. I want them to feel comfortable asking me to stop something."
1246,depression,Does it frustrated you when your other family members enjoying their life?,"I’m not trying to be an ass about wanting to ruin their happiness or whatever. Although, I’m happy, but at the same time I’m sad.

Imagine walking out my bedroom everyday, wanting to hang out with them but found out it’s empty, and never got to talk with them until I stopped coming out.

Anyways, I’d love to hear your stories :)"
1247,depression,Today was terrible and tomorrow will be terrible,I’m overwhelmed by school and work. I have not felt happy for several weeks now. I live in a new area (I moved during the pandemic) so I have no friends. A good day at this point is when I just feel numb. The worst part is that it seems like this is just what life is meant to be like from now on.
1248,depression,I want to vent out...,"Hello Everyone!   
I honestly don't know if I am depressed or just sad.   
I had 3 test I found on google about if I am depressed or not and it scared the shit out of me the test says that I am depressed but I know like I don't know they say never believe it not unless you go to the doctor right.  


Lately I thought I was just being lazy but I am not like before. I am a stay at home wife before I clean the house like almost everyday depends on what's on schedule but now I haven't been cleaning the house. I don't even take a bath as much as before, I am trying to take a bath everyday but it seems like everything is just too much right now. Even washing the dishes I just let it sit in the sink and when it smells I got no choice but to clean it sometimes that doesn't even bother me I just throw the water and put water with soap so that it wouldn't smell but sometimes I feel productive like folding the clothes one day productive and other days I don't even want to move.   


I just want to vent out I guess..."

1250,depression,16 Years Old and depressed,"I have never made a Reddit post before but I found this depressed forum and wanted to share my story. I’m 16 years old and have never really had trouble making friends. I’ve never had a best friend or a close friend however that never really bothered me that much until this year when I lost all my friends and have felt so lonely. Im too nice of a person to take up for myself and let people walk right over me and call me names and i don’t do anything about it. I have always had trouble learning in school because I have adhd and learning disabilities which makes school very difficult. This stresses me out because I have never gotten good grades even if I try my hardest so it’s gotten to the point where I don’t try anymore. My grades are too bad and I feel like it’s too late to fix them.   Since my grades have been so poor I feel like have no future ahead of me. The teachers have called me names like idiot, moron, worthless, and a failure. This took place at a private Christian school where people think nothing bad happens there. When I was there it was filled with bad influences. School got so stressful for me that I ran away from home and my parents ended up calling the police on me about this. I’ve always felt like a failure because I’ve never had a girlfriend and I have never really accomplished anything huge. I’m not very shy but I’m a very awkward person. There was this one girl at my school that I would talk to every day and I liked her for 3 years. I would go home and think about her all day. After 3 years I decided to make the decision to tell her I like her. After I did that she said she wanted to stay friends and I was fine with that. The next day I came to school her friends were making fun of me and she never talked to me since. After all these events happening I fell into depression and it has ruined my life. I lost all my friends because I don’t even talk to anyone anymore. I have switched schools and it has just gotten me more stressed out and I don’t see me making friends with anyone there because it’s a very small school. I am now taking medicine for this depression I have and it seems to only make me feel worse. I don’t know what to do about this anymore I sure hope I’m not the only one facing stuff like this."

I wish I was dead."
1253,depression,A story I guess,"My depression made me realized how detached I am to people. I always live life watching other people live I've hardly ever thought of my own existence. 2 weeks ago I was assigned  a essay on what is one thing wished we could had  stop from happening. The assignment was related to a book were reading in class and a moral in the book. We didn't have any prompts or anything because it was based on our real lives. At first I half assed it but then realized it's a project and a test grade so wrote about my long battle against mental illness because well it's the first regret that I thought . While I was writing I realized how peculiar my way of life is . How I cope with my emotions to how  I express them. My teacher had skimmed through our essays to pick and choose who would present theirs that day it was the last day of presenting and I was up to read . I didn't really have any emotions in it until I reached a paragraph on my longing for a interesting identity someone lovable or hatable and I neared the end of the paragraph and I read out a line "" if I'm That boring just turn me into something that you love . and when you get bored of me I'm pretty easy to replace so just throw me away  "" and I cant tell if it was just me but the room seemed more sad when I read out that line my English teachers face seemed depressed as well .  They essay wasn't that emoinal but that line kinda hit everyone in the room even the ones she weren't listening . I felt like I was 100 football fields away from everything  now when I go in that class I'm like a rare animal in a zoo being stared at and talked about right in front of me the teacher finds excuses not to call on me it's like I'm excluded which is fine I'm not mad about it.it's just well i dont know just weird"

1256,depression,Trigger warning: self harm,"I got drunk last night and had one of the worst breakdowns to date, i was crying for my life banging my head on the wall, punching and biting myself, even trying to choke myself

2 of my friends were there trying their hardest to stop me and im feeling really guilty making them worry abt me"
1257,depression,Idk just need to speak and not face repercussions,"No matter what my life is at good or bad or whatever everything just hurts. My brain feels rotted my souls feels rotted, there’s little left of what I was and am, there is no foreseeable life ahead of me. Those around me have no idea the extent to which I am gone and to what lengths I’m willing to go each night to punish myself to make myself feel better. All I have is a relationship, the only reason I’m not in the ground now, but i can’t make her happy without ruining myself. She’s all I ever wanted she’s everything I’ve cared for since we’ve met years ago and she has been the only thing that has shielded me from myself. But my color break through and I have to say something about how I feel, I disagree with this she does or, don’t like that about what she does, or there’s something she does that hurts me but doesn’t care and then it’s always me ending up to blame because if I say anything about something she is involved with she gets upset at me and it hurts. It hurts so much to have the only thing you love seem to hate you at these times. I don’t know what to do. I think about it all the time but I just can’t because I have to try to take care of her and I can’t leave her thinking it’s her fault because it’s me not her doing this. I feel like I’m too much for her or anyone to handle anymore, she’s an angel trying to pry the devils hands off of me but I cannot be saved. My soul is blackened my mind is shackled to the bad and my willingness to live grows ever so smaller each day. I weep as I lay in the still of each night, away from her, there is nothing to block out my thoughts, but the hope of returning to her where I haven’t upset her or made her resent me keeps me from achieving peace. I feel sometimes a persons fate is doomed, that I and I’m sure others are just this way from our birth and that our suffering is simply the nature of our existence. I loathe for the memory of nothing, the thought of nothingness and the solitude of death, but I still hold onto her each day and it all vanishes, briefly. But what happens when I upset her too much, when all that is left of her protection of me is what she once said but the truth is she wants to turn her back and leave. I wish to finally relive myself of myself but what if there’s still that bit in me that believes she cares, but I search for it and nothings there, then I’m in the pain I was in before, no help, nothing to stop me except hope. That was the most painful, the hope. Maybe someone would come along, they didn’t. Until she did, but I was already past the point of return, when you can’t stand to see yourself you aren’t meant to be here anymore. I want peace but I can’t do it, I wish I had it in me, but I love her too much, despite the fact she hates me when she makes me feel worse at times."
1258,depression,I feel like I'm losing all motivation..,"First time posting. 

I'm feel like everyday I just get closer to not knowing what to do with myself anymore. I don't know where to start to be entirely honest. So much has happened to over the years that they fall out of order, blur and meld with each other. And I'd be here all day..

Every time I try to pursue something it just blows up in my face. Art is something that I'm decently good at, but I know that I am not where I should be. My parents just took no interest in who I wanted to be..  
 I've tried making many video games that all fail. I even tried throwing what money I had at he problem with no dice.  
 I work at a dead end job, I can barely afford rent and I even managed to get a deal.. I would find another job.. but everything is just the same dead end retail/customer service horse shit.   
I met a girl that I really fell for, I mean just we click across the board. She started dating someone else within those 2 years anyway. It hurts a million times more to know that she wanted to but didn't want to risk making things awkward if things fell through.

Happiness is just extremely few and far between. 

I'm tired and there's pain o' plenty.. I just don't know what to do. I'm just taking it day by day, with hope that I just roll snake eyes and say ""peace out""."
1259,depression,how can i make food taste good again,"I've had depression since I was a teen (I'm 28 now) and have been professionally diagnosed with it, anxiety, PTSD, ADHD, and borderline. Sometimes when I'm really low I don't want to eat but food still tastes good even if I don't manage to eat a lot of it. But now it tastes bad.

All of it.

I did some googling and I guess stress and depression can make food taste bad. I keep gagging with most bites but I know I have to eat so I eat as much as I can manage. The only time it doesn't taste bad is if I douse it in hot sauce (following izombie rules here) and I can hardly finish my serving even then.

Please help. It's never gone this far before. I'm more stressed and bottling things up than ever bc my dad died and even though I didn't like him, I have to be strong for everyone. I can't sleep and now food tastes bad and I just want to disappear. I even gag on my medication"

I’m trans, brains worrying about holy shit I don’t look like the men and I’m sorta chubby too not hugely so just like 20 lbs  due to stress eating so I feel even crapper and uni deadlines are scary. But I can’t stop doing education because if I did that my child pension that I’m living in from my dad would stop.  And I’m sorta left feeling depressed and crappy and unmotivated. 

have a partner who I love and it’s a healthy relationship and all the rest but because. I kept on messing up during sex last night Like small mistakes that everyone makes, or even just things. Like I can’t help. I wanted to cry, like I don’t know what I can get to have my libido come back a bit.  But like yeah. Shit like last night keeps it down and,  I feel evil for being like that I say sorry when I don’t feel able to have sex and what not.

I've just been feeling incredibly lonely and I just have this inescapable feeling that I'm going to be this way forever. Like.. all I do is wake up everyday, go to work, come home, repeat. When am I ever going to meet someone and even if I did I have no idea how to make anything out of it. My depression has just been creeping back in recently.

She asks ""is that car still giving [mom] trouble?"" Shes been dead for over 4 years. Someone has to inform her, and when she is, she bursts into tears and then in a couple minutes, she forgets, and stops crying. And my father beats me and says ""if you tell anyone, I will kill you."" Luckily he doesn't know my reddit account. Even though he beats me, I still love him no matter the circumstance. My step-mom also hates me, but not the same as my dad does. I've been taking beatings from him for god knows how fucking long. I'm so tempted to grab a knife and slit their throats while they sleep, or do it to myself. I've moved away from them though. And my roommate will ask me about the scars on me. I don't know what to tell her. I don't want her to know. My grandmother is the only thing keeping me from killing myself, and she's eventually going to die. I haven't ate in a while either. Or slept. I'm completely dead inside.

I'm tired enough all the time without doing these things, I waste my day enough without putting time into these things, where do I fit in the time and energy?

1270,depression,"Yeah I'm not sure anymore. I'm too sensitive over everything, I just can not function properly on my own.","It's the same thing everyday, all I do is stay inside, try to do my hw(though I skip classes tons), try to draw, then sleep for like 10 hours or more, and just waste away at the end of everyday. I want to try. I wanted to try. I decided that I wasn't going to college, then I started to think about giving it a chance though it would have to be community college, and I don't even have the money to go there. Even then what would I study? I'm already a senior in highschool, been hopeless the entire 4 years here. Then I started to panic 
I panicked because even if I planned it out and seemed well maybe I'd never even go along with it which is so sad. It always makes me cry because I can never go along with things. Even when I plan them ahead of time. I feel physically and mentally incapable of doing any of this because I go into a rollercoaster of hope of planning things out and saying ""this time I really will try"" and then I start feeling such detrimental pain it gets unbearable because I know I really can't. I don't know why I can't I'm just stupid and useless. There's things I like and enjoy but I never can enter a field like that because I wouldn't be able to handle the stress.
I mean I can't even do simple commissions for art and that's my only talent. It doesn't help that when I turned 17 I was barely starting to appreciate being in school and then I realized 
I'm about to be a legal adult, my parents are going to expect more from me, I spent middleschool and highschool being stressed out because I've just been suffering so much from depression and trauma, and now that I was starting to heal from that my brain won't have time to process it because it's time to grow up. Does that make sense?..
 God I'm so tired and sad. 2 days ago I was thinking about maybe trying to read more and focus more on science or stuff or maybe study some mortician stuff, but I can't. The cycle just happened again and now I feel miserable and hopeless because I'll probably never get out of this endless loop of misery. 
My life isn't terrible or anything it's just that, I can never process things properly, or do things properly. I've become so lazy and I can't function at all anymore. Now it's so hard. I don't even procrastinate anymore, I just don't even do anything at all.
I couldn't even go through getting a part time job for the meantime. I'm afraid of becoming a neet but maybe I'm just that miserable that I'll let myself become one till I die or something. I don't have anyone to talk to about this either because if I have a conversation it will make me feel worse or like they don't understand, and they fmight but it won't fix anything. Strangers and close friends still say the same thing and they can't do anything about it because this is just a me problem that I need to learn how to fix on my own"

1273,depression,I can't do or feel anything,"Hello guys,
I'm dealing with a problem, maybe it's not a big one, but I want to confess it to someone. I started realizing that I'm not passionate about anything and I do the daily activities just like a ""to do list"", here including: watching series, looking at videos on Youtube. I do them and I don't feel anything : no surprise, no fascination, no hatred. My friends talk around me about their passions, their dreams and I feel I have no direction and also I feel everything is pointless. Even the field I study in College is not so fascinating or surprising, it's just decent and I can learn that quantify of information.

I literally spend all my day wasting time in my bed, scrolling on Facebook, thinking : ""what if I would did the things better in the past?"", without energy and with some suicidal thoughts, to cut off completely the situation I'm going through.


Everytime I try to memorize something about history, politics, geography, actors, etc. , literally anything, I feel I force myself to remember that and it's such a hard thing.

This memorizing process affects me even when I'm on the street or in any situation : ""Have you noticed that sign or that store?"", ""Do you remember that that person  wore a red dress, right?"". No, I don't remember these details.

I'm just lost in this whole target wind : passions, dreams, getting a gf, future plans (I don't have any and I don't feel I can make any) and I feel like an empty vase without feelings.

Also I know I have no talent at anything and everything seems forced.

I have to mention it's not depression, because I took meds who worked both as anxiolitics and antidepressants and they didn't work in my case.

Any suggestions for my problem?"

1275,depression,Would taking medication for mental illness make you less able to cope with your condition after stopping your doses compared to before you had ever taken medication?,"Say for example John has crippling depression. John went 6 years without taking medication and fighting depression alone with no assistance. He has become used to the pain in a sense but it still ruins his life in all sorts of ways. Then, one day, John decides to seek help from a professional and begins taking antidepressants for a couple years. They make him cope better, but for whatever reason, John decides to stop taking his antidepressants (the reason does not matter). Would John be less able to cope with his depression now since he became used to having the aid of medication and now is suddenly alone and without help again? Ignoring specific life circumstances and simply focusing on the depression; would he be at an even higher risk of suicide compared to before since he isn't used to this level of pain anymore and it came back so quickly and suddenly? Or would he simply revert to how he was before the medication and can get by the same as back then?"

1283,depression,I sexually assaulted my younger cousin but at the same time did not.,"This all started when I was 12 years old, I used to always go to my uncle’s house like every week or so. He has three daughters one of them being 17, the other being 15 and the youngest being 9. 

I remember I used to love playing games with my cousins like tag and many other childish games. So sometimes I used to play these kinds of games with my younger cousin which is 9 right now but was 7 at the time. 

It was all fine and we used to have fun till one day, I felt being touched. Now I was very stupid as a child, I thought she did it on purpose but in reality she did it by accident. The problem was I was holding her arm when she did that so I’m scared that when she grows up she will think I forcefully pulled her arm and put it on my genital. 

This is not the main problem though, I remember right after I felt being touched I went and touched her in the same area I got touched, yes. Now at that time I did know what a vagina was, but I thought it was located somewhere in the butt because ever since I was growing up my mom used to tell me that girls pee from their butts.

I remember my younger cousin twerking a lot on my face without me knowing and it kind of feels weird but I’m not that bothered with it since she was a child and didn’t really understand it was wrong. I used to always tell her, “ stop twerking, you don’t know to do it.” Because I thought this would make her stop but I realized that the more I used to say it the more she would do it. So I stopped saying it and caring. 

When we used to play these games I also realized that I would always be behind her so it used to look like I was dry humping her or rubbing it on her. But again, when I used to do this I didn’t have a deep brain about sexual activity so I just kept on with it and thought it was normal.

A few months after this happened I remember playing a game which involves taking the phone from each other. She took my phone and ran around with it and then we she got tired she was standing near the bed bending over. When I saw that she was using my phone and spamming random passwords I rushed to take it from her immediately. I stood behind her and bent over to take the phone from her hand, and when I took it I quickly opened it and checked it. While I was checking it I noticed she was twerking on me, so I remember pushing her and I got angry and yelled at her. And by the way, this was after my mind developed sexually.

I don’t blame it on her, even If I was doing all this stuff while not being aware I take full responsibility for my stupidity and lack of knowledge even if I was only 12 years old. I realized that most children would exposed to porn before being 12 and I shocked and anxious because I know this could be used against me. When I was 12 I indeed did know what sex was but I never had a deep mind about it because i only saw a couple of sex scenes which only involved kissing in bed without showing nudity. I also used to watch kissing pranks before i was 12 but this doesnt really have an effect on what i did since its just kissing.

I also remembered grabbing her ass while she was twerking on my face as a joke, because some videos i used to watch on the internet involved this stuff and really thought of it as jokes. some examples of these videos involved jake paul and logan Paul. And as a kid I remember it was so easy to manipulate me, for example whenever I used to watch something I would end up doing the same actions  in the videos. 

I just turned 14 last week and for the past 2 months I've been feeling sad and afraid. I'm sick of it, I'm sick of faking my smiles with my friends and family. I'm very afraid of what will happen with my future, more importantly to my cousin's future because I know that she will one day realize this and think I'm a bad person because it looked like i was fully aware of what I was doing. I plan on apologizing to my cousin in the future, but I'm afraid that she won't believe me and I would later be portrait as a bad person. 

And to finish this story, I deeply apologize to every single person who are victims of sexual assault and rape. I just want to let all of you know that it's not your faults and you guys are kings and queens. So please keep your heads up. Goodbye and have a good day."

1288,depression,why do I feel like this,"I know so many people with divorced parents, just big family problems in general. I have good grades, good parents,friends gave been, well...meh. But something is not right. (TW:SH discussion)
Right now I feel like everything should be fine. But something says otherwise. 
In the first quarantine, shit hit the fan. My dad was working abroad so my mom was alone with my sisters. It was awful, if she wasn't in the mood for even eating, no one would, I'd have to make dinner for my sisters out of scraps. If she felt bad, everyone would. During that period, my sh got worse, Id use it as a reward for finishing assignments and so on. It was hard on everyone, she acted like it was only for her, when I would be the one to clean up her mess. In a sense she was right, but only to a small extent.
In April (2020) she noticed my cuts. She looked me in the eyes and told me she would check on me everyday to make sure I wouldn't do it anymore (never admitted it, I just told her a lame excuse but there was no chance of hiding at that point). She never did. I realized she doesn't care, neither does my dad. If grades are good and we are respectful, shit is great.
It has been a long time since then, my parents act like everything is perfect. I have been clean for seven months but it'll reset soon. I don't know why. I feel like this period of time is what affects me the most but idfk why and it's frustrating. Almost as if I want to be sad."
1289,depression,suffering for the possibility of a better future,"I’ve felt like dogshit for years. I go to a very conservative school in a pretty conservative town and ever since I came out as transgender my mental health has only gotten worse. I am constantly being misgendered, people harass me by calling me slurs or being generally transphobic and stuff like that has been only getting worse. At this point I’m worried it will keep escalating - in my county half of all reported hate crimes came from my town, the majority of which were on the basis of being LGBT, and we dont know the real number cause most lgbtq ppl in my town are scared of the cops. I don’t even really know why I’m attending school or working so hard on my assignments. I tell myself I’m going to school because I want to have a job I love and that I go through all this pain everyday because I want to know things will get better, but what will I do if it doesn’t get better? what if I hate life later just as much as I hate it now? Even if I did enjoy life later, would all the pain I’m in now even have been really worth it? Even if I did enjoy life later, I will still be broken. I don’t even have any close friends at the school, only one person I talk to online. I am in therapy, and my therapist is good but my parents have forced me to see him biweekly instead of every week (not because we have to we can afford to see him every week). I’m extraordinarily fortunate I can see him at all, but it would be a lie to say that its isn’t effecting me a lot. I tried to take his advice and talk to my online friend about what I’m going through, but even if I get as far as mentioning it to him, I never truly talk about whats going on since I try to turn all of the bad experiences I have into a joke. All fo this pain has no meaning. This pain will probably never be worth it in the end, but I can’t kill myself do to my younger siblings so I may just be like this for a very long time.

1293,depression,I feel really stupid,"    I am 25 years old and im not feeling well mentally from a long period of time ,and a recent incident ,seems silly but it's affecting me a lot ,I am not able to sleep or eat , feeling low continuously
       So this is what happened,my mom sent me to a shop to buy tomatoes and the store keeper was busy so he asked me to weigh it for myself ,it did not occur to me or I don't know I was absent minded or what I feel being really stupid the electronic scale was in negative and I had to use the tare option and I overlooked it  and I don't know what happened to me I weighed the tomatoes and obviously showed the right weight even though the quantity was less (like u get 16 to 18 small sized ones for a kg ,where I weighed less quantity of tomatoes for the right weight because of error)
    The thing is i knew something was wrong that I had to get more number for the weight yet I doubted myself to think like that and returned home and obviously mom started yelling at me for not knowing a simple thing and I was so dumb at this age  and it made her sad because of that...
      I feel really stupid because I have a degree in science and that I'm just dumb or will do well only in school and not in life and I feel really stupid and worthless because apparently I'm not getting a job because the public sector is the only one which have job openings for my degree and they have not invited for jobs yet....and hence I'm unemployed since 3 years...
      I am a bright student which makes me even more dumb thinking of all this...that I'm like how everyone thinks that I was just good at school and not in life...such incidents make me feel they are  very true and I get scared and I feel extremely depressed about the fact that I will fail in life..
    My parents were like u only know stuff in books and u are dumb at practical things in life and my whole life feels pointless right now... I really don't know what to do but I know that I'm not at a good place mentally and I feel I'm stuck in a loop"

In last year , I moved to a new high school where I have a bit better environment and classmate but my dad was passed away because of the lung disease and diabetes and he's the main backbone of my family. In last year it's the first year of high school and it has a swimming subject but I scared of deep water , So I can only swim in a shallow area of the class pool. At first teacher almost give me fail and she was really rude to me but she saw that I was tried my best for the swimming , So luckily she gave me a barely passing grade. Now I'm in the second year of high school but I'm studying online due to the pandemic and some teachers give me like 2 times more homework than studying in a normal classroom. In past weeks I have to do at least 1 - 2 assignments almost everyday. And the last thing that I stress is borrowing a student loan , I have to borrow it because of my family having a little bit financial problem due to the pandemic. The student loan system in a place where I live is really complicated and need a lot of documents about mine and my family information to get it and a teacher who check the students document that borrowing it also very picky and seem doesn't want some students to get it by commanding them to keep editing their document in a several times. I'm the one who have edited some documents in a several times. I have a lot of stress , anxious and depressed during in my teenage life. While my friends just only have to studying hard and they seem don't have many other things to stress like me. BTW I keep looking forward for my future , I hope I will be better after the high school life."

We aren’t scavenging and farming to survive. We’re not sleeping in the streets like the paupers in the 1600s. We don’t have to have 15 or 20 kids in the hopes that 3 or 4 survive beyond their 20’s - in fact, medical treatment has gotten SO good that we’re living too LONG, and eating up resources meant for our descendants. 

We can’t survive without society - which means we work these truly “useless” jobs if some great catastrophe were to happen. But we spend ALL of our damn waking hours in this place to make enough $$ to not starve, or have to live in a tent, and to take a vacation once a goddamn year to remind us WHY THE FUCK WERE ALIVE, and killing ourselves working jobs we hate 😂. 

Is it kids? Is it the biological imperative so strong that it overrides common sense? Bc If anyone thought for more than a moment - no one would actually choose to bring kids into this Fucking awful world.

I’m having an existential crisis, and I’m struggling to remember why I’m going to school and working all these hours just to  teach Ava that that’s all there is? 

Or is it Fucking cliched “love” and “serving others”? As if I should have to find my meaning in something other than myself. It’s kinda fucked up, fr.

I guess if you have any thoughts, or ideas I am missing - I’d love to hear them. I want to reach My kids better than my parents taught me. And right now I’m struggling with wanting to straight kill myself 🤷🏼‍♀️"
1308,depression,How Do I Bring This Up?,"I think I need to talk to someone. I don't feel like who I was. 

Briefly, I'm gay (20M) and keep it under wraps and am not stereotypically gay in any way if save for the fact that I can be argumentative. The one person I revealed this to betrayed my trust less than 3 months later by telling my OTHER friend who I had known much, much longer that I was gay.

Long story short, confided in one close friend I was gay and had feelings for him, turns out he's gay and he can't make it 3 months before throwing me under the bus with him. 

Word travels in my group and I rapidly become anxious, something that I haven't beat and has worsened. I didn't have any issues in particular with anyone besides beating myself up. No one has cut me off or anything of the sort but having my disclosure ripped away from me, something I tried so hard to keep until I was ready (I might only now be getting comfortable, but this varies between feeling alright and crushing myself).

Death has always scared me and will likely until I finally do die. I lost a relative at 5 years old and was crushed at that, learning I'd never see them again. A few (about 3-4) years later and I actually do breakdown in front of my parents and finally pour out how I feel, my barrage of thoughts about the end all day. I'm told basically everyone dies and maybe I should look to God. My parents were always a bit religious but never enough to really attend mass, certainly not regularly though my mother and I did go to one or two. I was able to believe in God for a short period of time fully but I simply can't now. I try to rationalize things and belief just isn't one of those things for me. Go figure, the gay computer engineering student doesn't believe in God, no shit.

Fast forward to 2020, I lose another relative to Dementia in a care home. Not related to Covid thankfully, but fuck I didn't handle that well. She fought it for 13 years, I'm sure she was lucid for a very long time, poor lady. She always remembered me and my mom for the longest time, until perhaps the last 6 years or so when things began to get much worse for her. My first encounter truly seeing what these illnesses could do is probably when I was 10-11 visiting her with my mom at a LTC facility. She was having a very good day I suppose, I was a kid but I don't remember a thing being off about her, we had a lovely conversation the three of us. My mom had been away for a couple moments as she had gone to get food or something along the lines but in the short period of her absence a very tall (idk I was smol) man who clearly was suffering from some very aggressive mental illness as he had approached me very close before just screaming and screaming... that got my moms attention real quick as she had picked my up and out of there faster than I could blink. 

This encounter shook me, but my before my grandmother had died in 2020 my mom was able to get access to visit her when her health began to rapidly decline in March. Over a video call where we were supposed to say our goodbyes I just broke down when I saw her, the strong woman we loved no more. Now just a poor, frail set of bones with a thin layer of skin with her mouth hung agape. I completely lost my composure before fucking off to my bedroom for the next 20 hours.

I'd already been pretty depressed and probably FAR too much self-loathing for the last couple years. Realizing a lot of my friends in elementary school put distance between us when they saw I was gay before I did. Making a lot of stupid decisions when I was younger. Making a lot of stupid decisions when I was older. I'm pretty full of self-hatred honestly.

Then my buddy killed himself this year, somewhat recently actually. It's hurt everyone obviously but it's been the worst having to see what it's done to his family.

It's probably stopped me from hanging myself seeing how everyone felt. I couldn't do that to my family, I just don't think I could hurt my worst enemy like that even.

It's hard to say sometimes if I'll be missed even but I know that's silly. No one has time for me is the problem, when I'm really just seemingly expected to give and be full of life still.

I just don't see myself anymore in the mirror. I wish no one else did either.

It's clear to me that I don't have an outlet in this family given their most ""helpful"" advice (I don't blame them it's my fault).  I just don't know how to ask them to help me find someone. I've been sitting on the edge for a long time this year and I know that I need to see someone pretty soon or I'll end up in a darker spot than I am now. I just wish I could go to my friends without looking like a selfish bastard right now.

I fear death yet feel myself mustering the courage to do something about it. I don't see a point in dwelling in my torment through whatever life may have to offer. I think about death every hour and slitting my throat each day. I was always scared of my own morbid curiosity, I now know why. 

I know I need to talk to someone but I don't feel like I could get anyone to listen to me without coming off like a complete douchebag, friends or family. Friends as for the recent events and family because they have been so busy themselves. How do I talk to my parents about a therapist because I really am at my end here, I can't keep shuttered down anymore"
1309,depression,"Could this be depression? I don't think it is, but I don't know where to turn...","From my post on askdocs that nobody will answer:

36, male.
5'10"" 130. 
No medications.
No known relevant medical history. 

Last week, I had this weird thing where after I had eaten very little, my appetite suddenly shut off. Like I was full. 

Then on Sunday, it happened again. Only this time I didn't feel full, but rather realized I just wasn't hungry anymore.

Since then, I haven't felt hungry. I don't even remember what hunger feels like. I can eat, but I don't enjoy it/desire it, and my stomach feels full after much smaller amounts.

Then in the last three days, my sex drive has also vanished. 

And as this has gone on, I have realized that *all* of my psychological feelings are basically gone. I feel nothing except concern. I'm a guy with major anxiety and I don't even really feel that anxious now. 

I don't really know what ""depresssion"" is, but I don't know how it would be that. I don't have any suicidal thoughts. I'm just sort of wondering whether or not I'm going to be numb for the rest of my life.

What could this even be?

--------

It feels like whatever chemicals were responsible for me feeling stuff were just shut off for no reason. My life hasn't changed. 

I only feel dull versions of feelings now. Dulled senses of caring. A dull sense of, ""she's hot."" A little bit of humor. 

I'm hoping it's depression...maybe I caught covid and am having strange symptoms, absent any cold/flu symptoms.

Maybe it's from the vaccine I received months ago. 

Otherwise, I don't see how it's not cancer. Cancer of what, I'm not sure."

I’m flat and am struggling to feel joy, worse I’m struggling to even cry. You know sometimes you just need a good cry to help get those emotions out? I can feel myself on the brink. The heaviness in my chest but nothing. Everything is shit, there’s not even anything in particular that’s wrong, I’m just irritable lately and feel sad or I guess nothingness. 
It’s been 2 months, maybe more. I just want to feel okay again. I’m sick of feeling depressed about myself and the world. I’ve tried seeing friends, exercise, talking about it. I could see a doctor or a shrink but I can’t afford it. Am I just doomed? Is this it? I just want this nothingness to end."

1317,depression,I became a far right extremist because of my lack of love,"I guess I have no shame at this point so I'll just tell a story about me: In June of 2021 (not that long ago but it's felt like years) I began slowly diving head first into depression. I began to withdraw from anything social and locked myself away for days on end. I had nothing, noone, and nothing to hope for or nowhere to go. Before all of this I had been learning how to be a more peaceful person (I have bipolar disorder) and I somehow (stupid of me) began to cycle my depression into hate gradually, I had a half of a month where I felt fine after I got through a rough patch but I'm going right back in. And I (was not indoctrinated, optionally) 'joined' the far right. Though I'm aware that this is making me even worse at this point I have nothing else to think about.

I'd like to say though: (I began to put my hate into leftism big time, not a nazi or anything like that, just hate socialism)

Idfk why I'm such an idiot, I deserve this shit for my stupidity but idk why it has to continue with no hope ahead of me."

I don’t even think seeing a psychotherapist will help me because I’m already too damaged and fucked up all around. I mean, not everyone is meant to be saved and I *HATE* it when people tell me otherwise. I just want to die alright! You don’t matter to me like I don’t matter to you, okay?! GOT IT! Geez!"

Has anyone ever gotten a different formula of your med and feel like it was less effective? My 20mg citaloprams used to be small, round, white tablets and now they’re oblong, brown tablets. They’re still 20mg citaloprams, but I just feel more blah since the change. Google and webmd both say that the formulary between generics are the same and that they would all work a like, so I don’t know if it’s a placebo effect, a poorly timed need for an adjustment, or a less effective generic. 

Has anyone experienced anything like this, because I just want to melt into my bed and never leave it."

I picture my little guy scared and alone, with nobody who will love him or be as patient with him as I am. My bigger dog would fit in in any home, but my little guy would struggle. That is the singular reason I did not commit suicide this month. I was this || close. But I looked at my boys, and knew that I can't leave them. They're 1, and have a lot of time needing me left in them. So I will wake up every day and take care of them, while every night brings a new level of discomfort in some form or another. I wish they knew more than like 5 words that don't even form a sentence. I wish I could tell them how important they are, and that I love them the most out of anything in the world.

Family, school and counselors are not an option. I'm not a bad kid, but I wanna hurt someone, I don't know anymore, I need help."
1328,depression,My life is a void so I filled it with other people's responsibilities.,"I allowed my sister to take advantage of me and now I feel like... let's start with ""shit"" and go from there. She is 10 years older than me, married, just had a baby. I am single, living with parent, going nowhere. She inherited a cleaning business from my parents which she's been running for ten years. She's always disliked it, but did it anyway, I guess because she felt a duty or couldn't think of anything else to do or something. Same reason I agreed to run it, although I have another job that I do mornings and evenings, which by some miracle I actually enjoy. 

Anyway, she had a baby five months ago and she basically fobbed the whole thing onto me, because, while I was under the impression she would be back after a few months, it turns out she wants to set up on her own as a mortgage advisor, she's got the qualifications. So I'm now doing this indefinitely and what with my social anxiety, I'm having a really hard time running it. 

There is almost 100 clients and I feel pressure from both cleaners and clients to keep going, I don't want to let people down, but it's hard to say no, and it's hard to say yes and take on yet more responsibility. It's so hard to pick up the phone, I don't even like looking at it. When it rings my heart pounds in my ears, I just let it go to voicemail now. It's hard dragging myself to every appointment, forcing a smile onto my face, conjuring up some vestige of confidence. My first appointment I had a massive panic attack afterwards, I called my sister for some support and she slammed the phone down on me, zero sympathy. She never said thank you, sister, for taking on this responsibility so I can live the life I want to. I thought she would understand because she always complains about it as well, it's not like she doesn't know exactly how I feel. 

I struggle with depression and initially I was having a good time because it gave me something to focus on and I was relishing the new challenge, 5 months on I'm worse than ever.

I just want to get rid of the whole thing, but I don't have an idiotic younger sibling to deal with it for me. I have to be the one to call people and let them down. The money is not worth the stress, my every waking moment is spent worrying and it's hard to sleep. I'm crying at 4am, I'm falling apart by degrees. But I also need to think about how my Mum will react, and the regret at a lost opportunity, and the disappointment in myself that I'm not strong enough to cope, yet again, and whether I should sell it instead of just jack it in. I don't want to let people down, I don't want to let myself down.

My sister comes over with her baby, all smiles and hopes for the future, I just want to crawl into a hole and never wake up. I want to feel love, all I feel is resentment and self-loathing. 

Just trying to get this off my chest a bit, clear my mind, but if you've got this far, thank you, have a cookie 🍪 and let me know if you think talking to someone would help me out of this hole I've dug for myself? If I give up, will I just be giving in to my fears, avoiding the things that make me uncomfortable? Is there a version of me in here that can do this, or should I accept this isn't for me and carry on living my boring, stagnant life?"

1332,depression,How to encourage my partner to get help?,"If you look at my latest post history in Tryingforababy I am dealing with a heavy situation where my partner suddenly says he no longer wants to try to have children after 2 years of trying. We’ve been together for 5 years. 

I’m facing another large issue too though: how do I get him to get help for the depression he’s disclosed to me? 

This past week he’s made statements like: 

“Nothing in life makes me happy.”

“I don’t know what happiness feels like.”

“Only extreme things cause me to react. I don’t understand why things that should make me happy do nothing to me. I recognize I should be feeling happy those times but I never feel it.”

“I’m depressed.”

“I’ve always been this way. I feel like I’m not a human. I’ve tried hard to ‘fake it ‘til you make it’ so other people aren’t disappointed when I’m not happy and they are but it hasn’t helped.”

A deer just casually strolled in front of our vehicle in the middle of the city. I was shocked and reacted as such. I took a photo and everything. He literally had no reaction at all, as if this happens every day to him. He’s brought this up also saying he feels like many times he doesn’t feel *anything* when he should and that this extends past just the happy emotion. 

I’m trying to encourage him to see a psychiatrist, as it sounds like maybe he needs medicated along with mental therapy.

The thing is, he’s declining. He’s worried he can’t be helped. Tonight he said he’s afraid that he’s just saying things but maybe they’re not true despite also saying he isn’t lying though (I think he means he’s afraid he’s blowing things out of proportion—English is not his first language).

He works a job where he has to keep certain clearances and I know he’s worried a mental health diagnosis could impact future career growth. 

But…he really needs help! How do I help him? I hate to think he never gets to feel happy. He’s such a beautiful person, it seems unfair that he’s suffering like this. What do I do for him?"

I started doubting all my relationships too I just don’t know what to feel anymore ."
1335,depression,"(19M) Need advice, need someone to talk to","In two-ish weeks I’m going with two of my male friends to meet up with two female friends that I haven’t seen in over a year. We’re going to a restaurant to get dinner and then catch a movie. I’ve had a crush on one of them (let’s call her Alice) for over a year and haven’t really had much contact with her because she was dating a close friend of mine (let’s call him Randy) and they split up a year ago. I’m thinking of asking her out after hanging out a few times and hopefully getting together. I’ve known her since kindergarten for reference.

Randy and Alice split up peacefully but I was frustrated with Randy at the time for reasons I don’t recall and I spilled the beans to Alice on a lot of things that I probably shouldn’t have, regarding him and his shitty behaviour behind closed doors and how he really felt about her. That resulted in her basically telling him to kick rocks and blocking him on everything. I know that I shouldn’t have done that to him and it’s an awful human thing to do, trust me I’ve had a year to ponder that over and over. During that conversation I let it slip that I was interested in her and she made a comment to the effect of “looks like I chose the wrong one”. I was honestly really scared because I didn’t know how serious of a comment it was and I generally overthink things too much so I responded with a simple “haha”. It was the best I could come up with at the time.

Fast forward a year and I haven’t seen her since but I still see Randy regularly. I’m certain that he won’t be happy about it, I do plan on telling him ahead of time and having a conversation with him and frankly I’m worried that he’ll just cut me off entirely or that it’ll ruin our friendship. We have both been there for one another in difficult times. I haven’t had a relationship since 8th Grade, it pains me to admit. I have made steps to better myself though, I’m going to the gym, eating better and when my probation period is over at my apprenticeship I plan to use some of my benefits to get a therapist. 

Even if she was interested in me at this point and we did get together, I feel like I have a lot of baggage mentally and that I’d just end up fucking it up which makes me not want to even try to be honest. Would I be a bad person for scamming her with the confident, funny guy persona? It’d feel like I’m tricking her. How am I supposed to be genuine without sending her running the the complete opposite direction? 

Full disclosure, there are nights where I’m up late and can’t sleep and I’m just beating on myself mentally, thinking about how I hate myself and if it wasn’t for the ripple effect it would have on those around me then I’d want to not “be here” anymore if that makes sense. No need to worry though, I wouldn’t ever do anything, it’s just thoughts. I didn’t fall asleep last night until like 6:30 AM. I don’t think anybody deserves to be dragged down by me, which makes it even harder to talk about this stuff when I feel like I’m burdening people when I do.

On the flip side, I feel like never having been in a real long term relationship has been a substantial source of my anxiety. I feel like there is this huge piece of life that I’m missing out on and time is running out, who knows how long it will take to “fix” me. Who wants to date a guy in his thirties who has never been in a real relationship? It’s fucking humiliating. I realize most of what I’ve typed so far is meaningless if she doesn’t actually like me back which makes this situation so silly. When I have a crush on someone I overthink way too much and I run all the possible scenarios through my head on repeat and torture myself with it.

So I guess I’m just looking for a little guidance here. Do I go for it? Do I leave it alone. Am I not ready for this kind of thing yet? If so, how do I get ready? I really like her, she has her shit together, she has a great personality and whenever I’m around her I have a good time. I feel a pressure to try and get this done sooner than later because she will definitely find someone at some point and if I take the extra time to figure my shit out, I could miss the boat. 

Thanks for trudging through my thoughts here and I’m sorry for the inconvenience. Any help/advice is much appreciated."

She started mocking my “stress” and says “you can’t even handle 17 year old life” says “I wish I could [h4rming method] myself to relieve “stress”. She says she’ll have me committed and remove me from school, my job, banned me from my homecoming dance. I pay for 90 percent of everything I own. All off my clothes, my phone, my furniture, MY FOOD!! and even sanitary products and underwear. And she’ll tell my dad and last time that happened he screamed and cried at me and told me he wish I would d!e…so…
I’m very scared. I’m making as much food as I can to binge to make me feel better. I’m so scared I can’t even cry. She still acts horrible knowing my brother died of suicide. She’s told me to kms multiple times. I’m really scared I want to down a whole bottle. She won’t get me therapy so this and restriction is my coping mechanisms."
1339,depression,Fight or Fight?,"I think this is the correct term for how I handle certain situations but I'm unsure. Hoping someone can give me some insight.

An example of this would be say I'm put in a stressful situation at work that sends me into an almost complete breakdown. 

A stressful situation to me could be being called into the managers office for something I did wrong or some sort of issue that has happened. I get so overwhelmed and upset that I will simply walk out and leave. By doing this, in my mind, I don't have to deal with the situation anymore and can avoid the anxiety and stress I was overcome with during that particular situation.

For the brief moment of walking out, as in just getting in the car without telling anyone and going home, I feel somewhat relaxed knowing I am away from the situation and do not have to face it. Of course then the panic sets in a few hours later of what did I just do. When that begins to happen I have allowed myself to slightly calm down before the panic of do I still have a job sets in.

I tend to do this in all stressful situations. I simply leave or walk away because I cannot handle what is going on. It's not until later that I realize the consequences my actions may have caused. Would this be considered a fight or flight reaction?"

1346,depression,Tonight there was a strong intensity to unalive myself,"I don’t believe in people anymore. It’s hard to trust but perhaps I’m projecting my own insecurities, maybe I really don’t trust myself. I’m tired of seeing everyone out for themselves, the “mememe” culture, the lack of communication, the promotion of being your most phony self to serve a standard set by no one other than you and what society has pressured. The pressure to fit an image of beauty/success/education. I don’t believe in the phrases “don’t give a fuck or care what others think” or “you need to love yourself” because at this point they’re phrased just thrown for the sake of filling in the blanks ____ of what is uncomfortable or what you’re unsure of. We care about the opinion of others to a certain degree I feel that it’s ridiculous to deny that we are influenced by our environment. And that’s what’s frustrating is the current environment and situation I’m in now. Because at the moment of this intensity it’s easy to say I am not successful, I am not pretty, I’m no one special and degrade myself to a sense of nothingness. And that is my own toxicity for having what you may call weakness to be okay with the present. They say be thankful with what you have but what can I say? I’m ambitious and I’m tired and feel flattened. Because the more I go on the more I feel what was good drifting away"
1347,depression,Are my parents the reason why I’m depressed????,"As child I grew up with parents that fought all the time and even sometimes get physical. I cried a lot growing up and was even REALLY shy and introverted. Parents separated for 2yrs and my mom brought me and my siblings with her(eventually moved back as a whole family). I was bullied throughout my entire elementary years. Had an awkward relationship with my dad when I became a teenager (I’m the youngest and my dads favorite) and he yelled at me a lot. When I was 16 he did something that broke our family apart while I was staying with my sister and her fiancé at another city during quarantine. Me and my mom moved to the city my sister is currently staying in. Still in touch with my dad. I never saw him the same but I still miss him sometimes. Currently 18 haven’t applied for school yet and I’m working 5 days a week with my sister as a server. Every night I review my day and overthink. I always find something to be disappointed of myself with and my head wants to explode from overthinking. I cry at least twice a week. When I’m not working I stay in bed all day in my room with my door locked, I have no energy to do anything. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Sometimes I look and think I’m so ugly that I start crying. Some days I binge eat, starve,  eat and purge,or barely eat and workouts because I think I’m so fat and my head is huge. I feel like I have a terrible personality and every time I do something I feel like I’m doing things wrong or people are going to get mad at me. I also hate when people brag about themselves or talks about their accomplishments to me (is that bad?)I’ve been single my whole life and I’m not happy about it.

As someone who struggles with depression and anxiety, I know how difficult everyday life can become. Mental health is still misunderstood, and finding help can be difficult and expensive. I'm passionate about mental health and want to try to help as many people as possible. Mental health improvement needs a revolutionary idea to help make it more accessible and convenient. 

    What are some things you wish you could have or wish were available to you to help you with your mental health? Better access to therapy?  Help with medication?  Diet and exercise? An app?   I'm trying to brainstorm some ideas. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

Somehow the happy prospect of owning a house and having a family (with kids or without) turns to ashes in my mouth when I realize that the best years of my life will probably be spent on the fringes of the collapse of civilization as we know it.

1351,depression,high school makes me just want to runaway,"I am currently a freshman in high school I just want to want to runaway.

School is usually something I can just glide through and I enjoy for the most part. I tend to do the assignments I enjoy and skip the things I find menial. I am told that I am smart kid, I don't get bullied, and I get acceptable grades. I wake up everyday to the same routine. I feel like I'm a inanimate robot just going through the motions. I honestly just don't no what to do. Everyday is miserable I put up with school until I get home then I just play games to take my mind off of everything. Everything I do is just enough to get me to the next day. I feel like I'm running in place, like I could have run marathon but I am just stuck. I don't want to go college for the life I want. Its as if someone just stole 4 years out of my life before I was even born, that feeling is so draining to me. I can't keep skipping school (I miss 2 days every week). I tried running away over the summer, I got a couple miles but I knew I couldn't go without money for long so I just called my parents to not drag it out. The only reason I haven't ran away again is because I don't want to put my family through that again just to come back. I'm aware that running away won't exactly solve any problems but it would at least be something new. 

I get treated for bi-polar depression which I've started recently and also see I therapist. Every solution people in my support system just feels like enough so I don't kill myself or runaway again. I can't keep doing this, I won't kill myself but I need a solution whether its dropping out or just running away. Its enticing, the idea of running away with a couple grand and setting up a simple life thousands of miles from here making just enough to support myself."

My family I avoid because of their toxic behavior and just so many stories of why I avoid them mostly let alone be able to go to any of them. 

About 5 months ago me,my son's mother and our son finally saved up and I found a good enough job to move out of my parents house in which we were living in ...about an hour away from anyone into a house with them,her sister and her mother. Which neither of them 3 I can go to and also me and her aren't together anymore so I have to pick up again and do it all over. I work 7 days a week at miserable fumigation job that it feels it takes over my life mentality and physically so until I find a job in which is as good or better pay I'm stuck and I'm to mentality tired to even try to look. Me and her do not get along of what's so ever and its been hard on us yes but especially on me because she has her family and more friends to go to in which I do not and she doesn't care to really talk about my issues nor try to understand or care when she even wants too. I can try and find friends but those times I wanna spend with my son because he's truly my little buddy and I'm a proud father and I love him so much also plus I have no time to even do that.. let alone fully enjoy some of my hobbies. (I work nights) 

I feel stuck... I've had problems with substances to coup with this situation and with my sever depression in which I get stuck in such a dark place that at some point my own son doesn't switch the thoughts of ending it so I have to think of him crying next to my casket to bring me back sort of. Also I've been starting to remember some terrible things that I blocked out from my childhood also when I'm in this dark haze,putting things together and remembering the sever mental,physical and...sexual abuse and just the childhood I wouldn't wish on no one.. I'm surprised I'm even still here and I'm proud of my strength.

I've been recently trying to stay sober after months of drinking every night,smoking every night and there was a moment I was doing E pills every night also about 2 months straight.. so there was times I didn't  sleep or ate for 3 or 2 days straight. Tonight I lost it at work because it's a miserable atmosphere and the one guy started yelling and I just flipped out and now I'm laying here..straing at the wall and crying just wishing things would get better. 

I just... don't know what to do anymore. I could never end it and do that to my son and I wanna watch him grow up and be there... but my life feels like it falls apart to quick enough for me to pick up the pieces and the chaos in my head I just want it to stop. I love life but sometimes ... what is there to love?"

My first semester of college I get hit with having to report my childhood abuser due to disclosing my abuse to a counselor. That tanks my freshman year. I was so busy fighting battles I never fought for myself. That theme continued until this year when I got Covid. I finally had a break down, started drowning in myself. I was panicked, full of health anxiety and I thought I was dying. I’m still depressed today and all of my friends and my former classmates have graduated college. I’ve dropped out twice now and I have nothing to show for my life. I’ve pushed tons of people away and all in all I’m disappointed in myself. The people I’ve known would be disappointed in me. I don’t know what to do to make myself proud. My intellect is trash post Covid, so is my self esteem. I’m morbidly obese. I have high blood pressure and a handful of psychiatric disorders.

Or, I’m constantly bending myself into pretzels and giving so much of my self, and others don’t even want to give an iota back. My friends who also struggle with mental health are so embroiled in their own things, it’s hard to find company with them sometimes, and my friends who don’t have the same struggles tend to offer platitudes as comfort.

It’s hard, leaving me feeling like the only person I have is me lately, and I’m not very good company.

I don’t like to think of myself as depressed, but I’ve known for the past 14 years I’m this way. 

I’ve done everything people have told me to: therapy, exercise, walking an hour a day, eating clean and healthy, spending time with friends and family, calling the hotlines, etc… 

I truly don’t think my brain is programmed for this. I have get togethers with my family almost bi-weekly, see friends, be active with golf, basketball, footy, and so on. I work in real estate and make a more than suitable living for myself. 

Every night and morning is the same. If there was a gun beside me I’d do the deed.

1366,depression,Struggling with acceptance,Hi I’m 24 and have really been struggling in life since I was 15. What started it all of is I have really bad stomach issues it’s still unknown what causes them. But I was sitting in class and my stomach just started killing me and it was insanely embarrassing also that was my first year in highschool so not a great start. So I dropped out of school and went homeschool because I just couldn’t stand to sit in class a problem that still plagues me today. Also during that time I was diagnosed with ocd I was constantly plagued by worries and constant rituals that I had to do another problem that stills plagues me between just one of those two things I’ve lost so much. I always felt like a freak I don’t know how to explain it but I’ve never felt human after these things happened I always felt like I was watching life through a window like I could never be apart of it and honestly I’ve never really been. So at 19 I tried to go to college and the same thing happened I dropped out of school a few months in do to the issues. At that point I started struggling with suicidal thoughts and extreme depression everyday. Still to this day. Also I looked a lot older due to this wrinkles on my face I would be a really good looking guy but I’ve gotten so old looking in just the past five years. I really just feel like a freak and I feel like I’ve lost everything like I need to have a funeral for the old me the me I really am and want to be but it doesn’t seem possible. I’ve tried I just started paramedic school and had to drop out because I was having such bad panic attacks which is a new thing for me and literally just started. It’s like I can’t catch a break. I know that sounds whinny but I’ve tried and I always lose. I had such big dreams for my self I’ve always wanted to be a pararescue guy in the air force and I feel like I could’ve been a great one if I just didn’t have the struggles I have now I’m just coming to terms with my life I’m 24 and still can’t sit in class because of stomach issues I missed my youth I have panic attacks over the tiniest thing I’m depressed and still struggle with bad ocd I feel like it’s over for me that I’ll never be the guy I could’ve been that life will always be a struggling it’s not fair to be like this why  could I have not been normal like so many others are just not have at least one of the issues I have is there anyone else out there like this I feel like such a freak and a loser I don’t want to die but I feel like it’s the only thing I can do

My dad basically quit his job and is now barely working and making half as much as he was a year ago. Our house is in the middle of being foreclosed and I dont know if I will have time to save money to move out on my own before we are kicked out. Ive never felt so fucking alone. Its impossible to date when you're an antisocial ugly loser that lives in the house that I do. Ive never really had a real relationship. I probably never will. I have maybe one real friend, and sometimes I feel like even they dont really care for me. I dont know what it feels like to be loved. To be happy. Everyday tasks are so fucking hard for me, even getting out of bed sometimes makes me feel like id rather be dead. I think abt suicide every day, but im a bitch and im scared to die. I want to believe in something, anything but its so hard when everything in my life has gone so wrong. I remember when I had dreamt of my future, my career, my life and I felt hope.

Now the issue comes in. They're like really young(minors) and I'm 21.  So whenever I express my ""love"" in some public servers... some found it creepy... (Saying hearing their voices give me hope, and I wish to make them happy). I genuinely meant that. I was...in a dark place...their voices gave me strength to carry on. And I always tried to appease them..buy them gifts and such. Like an older sibling would :] 

I'm not like that. I ain't....one of those creeps/pedos. Ugh.  I just....had no purpose in my life. Felt no reason to live...until I met them. I want to take care of them...like how an older sibling does. I never had siblings...I just hate it that its considered wrong and creepy to love your online friends. Like....the age shouldn't matter. But it does. And one should be very careful about the way they speak....sigh."
1380,depression,nostalgia is going to make me fail school (please read this),"it’s an exaggeration but i’m in first year of college and have a super hard exam at 7:20 am(it’s currently) 12:10 am and i haven’t studied a bit.
i’ve spend all day thinking of my best friend in elementary and how we saw each other grow, find hobbies, cry, laugh, get angry, everything. 
We went to a small elementary school so even though we did get other friends, we never split apart, we were the main thing.
We went to the same middle school (which had waaaaaaaaaaay more people than my other school) and we found new friends and started to naturally separate from each other.
I’m on college now and he lives like 6 states away."
1381,depression,I never been treated so unfairly throughout my life before,"This will be a long story, my apologies! And yes, SIMP alert, just to put it out here.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok it is all started with this girl who is my crush, turns out she's a manager of her company and she's looking for someone to hire. So I step in and wanted to do a marketing role which she agreed to. We helped each other and she even said she was thankful that I was there helping her because we're already short of manpower on an overloaded task set by our boss (which is her mother). Fast forward, one of the employee quit because he can't take it anymore because our boss being an asshole towards him. So since we're running low on manpower, i volunteer to take that ex-colleague role which is retail/bakery/storekeeper for the time being while my manager plans to hire someone else. But ... she didn't. 

&amp;#x200B;

Months pass by, and I'm having trouble doing multiple tasks here in this job. Not only I'm doing task that is way out of my jobscope, but I'm also having to do Overtime DAILY with only one-off day and no pay increase. Ok, not asking for a pay increase is my fault to be honest because I volunteer to stay back only because my manager stays back. Since no one is there to help her, I have to stay back so I don't mind doing it without any overtime pay. However, she seems to pick on me alot. Scold me whenever I couldn't get the job done that was assigned by her but the problem is, THERE ARE SO MUCH THINGS TO DO. And things not even on my jobscope.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought this up to her and she said she ""understand"" so she hired another person but that person is doing the role that I WAS INITIALLY signed up for. Instead of hiring retail/bakery/storekeeper, she hired a marketer which is what I was supposed to do. I was abit upset with this and I brought up this issue again and she said ""she understand"". I still like her very much so my anger towards her kind of depleted. But... she didn't actually do anything, as a matter in fact, she and her boss keeps scolding me of the things I did by a small mistake or not even my doing, yes I'm getting blamed for stuff that is NOT my doing. But then again, it is because of her I stayed. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been like this for 8 long months, And I can't handle it anymore because of all the unfairness that i've been getting. That one final scold from boss which is by far the most ridiculous thing I ever experienced, I quit and my manager kinda cried. But I did promise her that I will try to help her behind the scenes, in regards of marketing (and this will also prove to her that I  can help her do this role which I promised to). Things go smooth actually, but then she suddenly just changed the password of the company which I kinda needed to continue her work. She didn't even notify me, so i texted her and she just drop the ball on me saying I'm no longer working in the company because boss don't want me to work with her behind the scenes. She could have told me earlier instead of me wasting my time?. But that's not the suckiest part...

&amp;#x200B;

This is the suckiest part that makes me WANT TO KILL MYSELF, One of our colleague got forced to do a task outside of his jobscope and just for one day, he complains. AND MY MANAGER ACKNOWLEDGED IT AND STARTS TO PANIC. She apologize to him and said she learnt her lesson, as a matter in fact, she even plan to increase his pay. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? all these time of me working my ass off for 8 months doing multiple task that isn't my jobscope, being in Overtime DAILY with only one off day and this is what i get? no payment increase, no nothing?? And now I have no job, I was planning to be graphic designer which I'm working on my portfolio very hard for it, and now I have to rush finding a job, my plans to be a graphic designer have to put on halt and the worst of it all, I am still livid about all of this situation. She just living her life as per normal treating her colleagues with fairness while she shit on me. And I want to bring this up to her as my one final moment.. should I do it? I can't live with myself how I got screwed over and now I feel helpless. And I like her, she even said she used to like me. This whole thing sucks, I am so angry about the situation but I'm not fully angry with her. What is wrong with me? what should i do?"
1382,depression,New friends + depression,"Just don’t mix… hate trying to explain to people that I will eventually become a hermit and not respond to any messages. Wish I could take a break from having responsibilities. I’m so tired. No advice needed, just venting."
1383,depression,I’ve never felt this way before and I need someone to tell me what I can do this is the first time I’ve ever felt this immense sadness and I think it’s here to stay,I recently was told very shocking news that I can’t or never will get the chance to get over ( I will not say because it’s still not real to me writing it out makes this whole situation real so I’m sorry). My uncle and I are the only ones who know and he told me not to tell anyone but it’s eating me inside I need someone to talk to but I don’t have anyone to turn to. I’ve cried so much that my eyes are hurting. All I have been thinking about is why. So many thoughts are running through my brain. I want to be thankful for my girlfriend my family my situation up until this point but it’s so hard right now. Please help me I need something anything to help me feel better. I can’t get my crying to stop even now Im still crying like I just started hours ago. I know that I’ve been a terrible person and maybe what im going through is justice or karma but I really need someone to tell me something to make this all make sense.
1384,depression,I am stuck in a loop,"Since young I have been bullied.  How I am fat and indian  and it apparently was a problem to others. Everyday I get bullied,  for how I look. My mom used to do my hair with coconut oil, which was smelly for them. The food I brought were smelly for them. I looked ugly to them, like a alien. 

Throughout my 7-18 years of age I have been bullied everyday. They would throw sugar on me, steal my stuff, one time a girl kept smacking me on my head with a toy knife right in front of the teacher and I couldn't do anything. I just sat there and counted how many time she smacked me. 

After I turned 18 I needed to take a diploma of my liking by this point I was sad, did not know what to do, where to go, no dreams, no friends. From the day my school ended I just kept sleeping everyday. Usually teens will be hanging out with friends and working. But I was not able to do that. 

Eventually Got into a diploma that I did not like but still went ahead cause I finally escaped hell. Towards the start of the diploma I started feeling optimistic and motivated. It was like suddenly I was feeling all better. I decided to start afresh and I was actually able to do it. Well for the 3 years of diploma I aced everything, I had friends,  made study groups joined 4 different extra curriculums. I was able to concentrate and focus. I lost a ton of weight. I was in some Leadership positions. 


After I graduated I became depressed. I felt  the friends I has were not real. My diploma was in waste, I was a failure in every thing I do. I deleted all pics of me because I hated the way i looked. Stayed in bed all day and  cried. Did not go for any gathering or meetups. So my friends just stopped asking after a certain point. 


At this point I am completely alone, depressed, lonely and I did not know what to do next. work? or degree? I felt like I was wasting time. I didn't want stay like this. Forced myself to apply for all universities and potential  internships. I got both internship and acceptance but I was not jumping for joy. I knew I was depressed. I thought if I just jumped in all will work out fine. Once I am done I will be happy. 

To keep myself  busy I took both worked and did part time degree. I was wrong, I thought I would be happy but I became  more depressed, lonely and stressed. Numb to my feelings, I started to eat more. By my 2nd year in uni I was diagnosed  with diabetes. Fell into the spiral, did not have focus or motivation. Cried every night to sleep tries to harm myself by cutting my hand and hit myself several  times in the head to stop everything. Several times I wanted to die. I wanted to kill my self. 

None of which no one else knows because I hid everything from my family and colleagues. Because I was stubborn to not tell  anyone. Working on assignments till early morning but I won't  be able to sleep and I finally get to bed. Started to worry about everything and developed anxiety. I worried about everything. My work, my assignments, my face, my looks, my future, what will happen  if I die now, I was burned out from everything. I kept bottling up. Watched a lot of kdramas and bought a lot of things to cope. But nothing made me feel good. The company  thought I did well and gave me a permanent position. I did not get happiness  from this. This is where the pandemic hit there world. I started working from home. My concentration  was not there I felll back sometimes. Couldn't  understand lectures. 

When I finally finished my last exam for uni. I felt my body go numb, stayed in bed for 1 week. I took leave and just stayed in bed. After which I started to force my self out of bed and just wander around. By this time the restrictions  were lifted. I went to the mall alone, to the movies alone, walked. Just me and my head phones . I eat a lot during this time too. I hated how fat I looked. By the time I turned 23 I was 100 kg. 

 I had to loose weight because when marriages are arranged they potential  grooms hate fat women like me. Also due to my deteorating health. I kept getting  pain all over my body. 2021 I started my weight loss journey. Everything  became harder. Pulling my self out of bed going for a walk, gym. Till now I am trying. But I keep going in this loop where I will be doing well and there would be a rejection and I lose the motivation  to keep going. 

There was a time where I did not have food for 2-3 days. Other days I will lie and go out and eat everything. I wanted to be away from my home as far as possible for as long as possible because my home has now turned to hell. Everyday my mom and dad would scold me for sitting around. Everyday my mom and dad would point out my parts of my body to say they are fat. My stomach, leg, hands, arms, face, everything. Saying things like ""I know why you dun have friends, because who would be friends with if you are this fat?"", ""everyone is running away from you because you look like that"", "" who would want a elephant for a bride"", ""if you are fat now you will never be able to loose weight"" 


All these and several rejections and caused me to go in a loop. I would find some way to pick my self up and work on it. I will be trying my best to move forward. Than I break down when  I hear any comments as written above. Than I have to pick myself again little by little and try again. This has been happening to me since it started.  This is exhausting.

Before I decide to loose weight,  I did not let my depression affect my work or my family. Even though they hurt me, I didn't  speak of it much. But at the start of 2021 till now, I have had some panic attacks, I burst into tears and anger at small unessasary things. My work is also affected, I have not been happy and productive working also, It feels numb. Like I Do not want to do anything anymore. Waking up and brushing my teeth has not been a problem before. But now it takes me the whole morning. Going to the toilet takes time for me also . I keep sitting in my chair worrying  about everything, thinking blank till I feel pain then I realize. I has become worse. 

I see so many people working, being happy  I want to be happy but I am stuck I this loop. Unable move I am exhausted and tired. I have worked hard now I M 85 kg but I aim to be 70 by Dec. I have stuck here for a month now. No interest in anything. 


 This is my 1st time any one knows and I am telling the strangers on the internet."

1386,depression,I hate myself &amp; I’m super s*****al,"I am mad at society and I have so many reasons to be, but right now it’s because I feel like I can’t be good at things. I have this recurring thought that when my depression finally wins, I will make an impact on people that’s not my immediate family. But I really do think it’s nothing short of a fantasy. When the word comes that I’m not here anymore, those that aren’t related to me will have a short period of surprise and a select few may even feel down for a day or so, but then I will fade from their minds forevermore. And it’s very painful to know that I’ve made such a small impact on people that I cared about, regardless of my many efforts. Like I’ve said before, I’m so tired of meaning so little to so many."
1387,depression,"Well, how do you win against yourself ?","Ok so to set the scene, I’ve just entered college but it hasn’t been much all the fun and cool stuff you get told in high school. So I lost most of my friends but struggle to find my place in my studies this year.
I don’t know how to bring this up but basically I’ve been feeling completely empty lately like I have never been and I’m just 18. Like people keep saying go out speak to people make friends, laugh, but I don’t why but I can’t. I feel like people around me don’t understand me or just don’t have the same (idk if it’s the right term but) ""maturity"". So I end up staying alone with my thoughts wich has been a really bad thing these days, overthinking and the lack of sleep due to these thoughts really doesn’t help feeling better. So yeah I was wondering if you guys had any ideas about how to get out of this situation because overthinking and having the feeling of being completely empty and lonely really starts to be hard, it’s like I don’t know who I am anymore and as if I was losing myself.. So yeah any help or advice on what to do is welcome

Not to say I’m particularly drowning in overdue assignments, I just seem to have a hard time staying on task these days, and find myself quickly overwhelmed. I chose to continue my studies online, and it honestly hasn’t been the easiest (though I 100% prefer it to going back in-person).My energy for it has depleted, and often leaves me feeling drained, and like the work is never done. I’m sure others have felt this way, and am wondering if anyone had any input on the matter/what has worked for you. Anything helps, and all appreciated. Thank you."

1393,depression,Feels like I'm always too much for people,"I was diagnosed with depression two years ago and ever since then I haven't been able to not notice it when it creeps up. As a kid, because my parents were constantly fighting, I would turn to friends for support. This became a habit of mine because I had no one else to lean on when things got rough. 

Now I'm in my late 20s and talking to people about my depression just feels like I'm overwhelming them constantly. I've tried so many times to open up to only get one worded responses that really don't do much in the long run. I don't expect people to cure me, I know regulating is on me and is my responsibility. But I just want to be able to talk to someone without feeling like a burden. 

I had a therapist, but for financial reasons, I haven't gone to one in a while. Part of me really wants to find one again and just say fuck it to the money, but I usually just end up forgetting the next day til I end up right back here. 

At this point, all I want is for someone to say that they accept me for who I am with all of my fucked up baggage but I know I can't expect that from anyone so I just end up feeling worse about myself. I wish I never had this stupid illness."

1395,depression,Why do I get to live?,"Never posted here before...today I just cried to feel something. I don't cry often but over the months of feeling numb something just tingles inside you one day and it pours out. Then you think about everything about your life that's sad as fuck that didn't hit you emotionally before but now OF COURSE it's sad why didn't you feel this way about it earlier.

Just all the lights off and crying in bed to post rock thinking about how I could possibly deserve any opportunity given to me, that I've squandered my life smoking weed and playing video games and just working 9-5 to pay bills. Girlfriend left me probably because she came to the conclusion I'm a loser.


I rarely see my family even though they're local. I haven't had a close friend in years. I don't talk to anyone as openly as I want to like this. I've learned my coworkers tolerate me as opposed to thinking of them as friends. My boss sees my work declining because of my mental health and that was the one thing left I had pride in.


So many others have great ambition and accomplishments...I dropped out of college because it was too much mentally to juggle work and school. Only working where I am now because I had to pick something eventually. I don't want to kill myself. But I truly think I'm a waste of life, that it would be better off in someone else's hands"
1396,depression,CTE?,"Used to box as an amateur. Took a lot of hits to the head over the years. I'm 34 now, and my mental health has been declining for well over a decade. I have more difficulty paying attention than I've ever had. Every drug seems to have an outsized effect on me now. I become manic when I drink, and then I'm crippled with depression for a few days after. Cigarettes make my mood miserable. Coffee makes me super anxious. The entire world feels like a dream. I'm constantly in a fog.

I've been suicidal on and off since 2011. Recall waking up with a butcher knife in bed next to me after a night of drinking. I'd made the decision to kill myself at a house party, but after walking home, I was so exhausted, I decided to just pass out instead. Lately, the urge has been growing in me again. It's so constant now, I'm 90% sure my life is going to end with a bullet to the head or heart. I hear a lot of folks with CTE kill themselves.

At any rate, anyone else experiencing anything like this? Anyone know if these fucking loser doctors are ever going be able to test for CTE? I'm sick of seeking help from these people and getting nothing but bullshit diagnoses and pharmaceuticals that always inevitably make my condition worse."
1397,depression,My MIL (F70s) has just started taking effexor to treat her depression. What can she expect and watch for in the next couple of weeks to make sure her dosage is correct and she is responding well?,"Hi Reddit, 

I cannot seem to find any great answers online, so I thought I would reach out to those of you with practical experience. 

My MIL (F70s, weight \~130lbs) has just started taking 0.5mg of effexor (venlafaxine hcl xr37). She normally spends lots of time alone (worse due to COVID), but will be with my husband and I for the next 3 weeks. She agreed to start her treatment since we'll be around, but is still pretty nervous about taking an antidepressant and worried about possible side effects. 

For those of you who have taken this, what can she expect? Will the drug have any effects during this timeline? Or does it take longer? How will the drug change how she feels? What should we watch for to make sure her dosage is correct? 

Just looking to support her as best we can through this. Thank you so much."

I have no dreams, ambitions, or skills and every day it seems like everything is getting worse I hoped once high school was over I’d feel better but I was wrong I guess. Some extremely stressful situations have popped up over the last couple days that are really not helping and I know I’m never going to amount to anything so what’s the point of even trying anymore. I’m awful at communicating so talking to anyone has been a struggle for a while now I just don’t know what to do anymore."

1403,depression,"I have no desires no ambitions, hell I don't even think my life can be considered ""living"". But I love it and I think I will continue to live like this as long as I can, only feeling alive when it rains","I live through stories, through dreams, through other people eyes, I think I've got a lot of empathy for some reason. I lose myself in everything, movies, books, shows, videogames... I don't care which life I follow as long as it isn't my own, I don't feel sad even though sometimes I feel suicidal, I even got an attempt behind me, I don't really care. I'm 23 and I had a difficult life full of loss and sickness and I don't care for that either. I'm not a dumb person but I didn't and neither intend to follow through with my studies, I don't want a job either even though I think I will have to get one in order to get by. I just want to live throughout my stories, I want to lose myself in there forever, I really wish the afterlife will be just that, an amalgamation of lives where I forget everything and every time start anew but when I die I remember all the previous ones I've lived.


For some reason though there's always something that truly makes me feel alive, something that makes me happy and with which I share an incredible connection on so many levels; the rain. I love the rain so much, I always end up with a smile on my face whenever it starts to pour down, it's like some kind of miracle of nature and every time I wish it could go on forever. Rain is amazing, it's so dynamic and refreshing, the smell of dust it leaves it's the absolute best and it feels like when I can finally smell it when it starts raining, in that moment I truly feel alive. In no other instance I can feel that way or can I replicate it, I don't care for love but I think I'm in love with this weather. I think I only live to see the next time it will rain, over and over. Also the same way the rain makes me feel alive, the sun makes me feel dead inside and in pain, a physical pain it often enough translated into the real world, I swear it has debilitated me in many occasions. The heat, I can't stand it, the sweat brings stickiness, it burns my eyes, the sky becomes so monotonous it could just be dead for all I cared. Really, the sun sucks, I often wish for it to disappear forever, I don't care if I would die or the planet and all the people in it would die, I really just want it gone, every single day of my life. My first thoughts when I wake up every single day are ""is it raining?"" ""Please, please make it so today will be a rainy day"".


I don't really know why I'm writing this, maybe I hope to find someone who can understand me even though I doubt anyone, even in a situation similar to mine, could feel in exactly in the same way as I do. I think this world is amazing and that life is worth living, but I hate the sun, and I have having to do things I don't want to do in order to be able to enjoy it's wonders, it surely seems like the kind of cry a baby would do but it's a very strong sentiment, I don't want to work, I don't want to do nothing, I just want to read books and enjoy the falling rain forever."

1409,depression,(2020-2021: Worst Year of My Life),"The pandemic hit and the entire country shut down. I was still in college finishing up my last semester before graduating. I wasn't sure what the future was going to hold but I knew I wanted to find a job in the field. I went on a few interviews but never heard back or employers were put on a hiring freeze. I was desperate and didn't know what to do. Eventually a recruiter reached out to me on Linkedin for a Sales Development Rep for a 3PL. The interview process went well and I decided to accept the offer. I was glad I was able to find a job during the peak of the pandemic. I eventually moved to an apartment with some old roommates from college. Little did I know it would turn out to be the worst year of my life as I still stand here today. The job was going well as I was growing my book of business. But as time went on I quickly learned the reality of the ”Boiler Room”. The 3PL industry is competitive and cut throat. Having to make 100 calls a day and expected to hit a certain margin in 3 months  based on lead sheets or past accounts seemed impossible. I quickly learned how hard it was to grow your book of business. I eventually hit a breaking point as I was one of the lowest performers amongst my peers. This caused me to loose confidence and I quit during my 3rd month.  I felt a sense of relief but I didn't understand how important it was to not quit a job until you have another job. This is where things quickly turned downhill.

The next 7 months turned out to be the lowest point on my life. I have always lacked self confidence and I don't think I have ever believed in myself. I spent the next 6 months looking for work. I was actively applying on linked in and indeed desperately looking for work. I was so fearful of how my first experience in corporate turned out that I developed major anxiety and depression. I didn't even want to interview with new opportunities because I felt I was stupid and worthless. I began to isolate myself from my roommates at the time. I was having suicidal thoughts and wanting to end my life. During this time I learned that my so called ”friends and roomates” weren't my true friends. They were talking behind my back mocking me. 
I felt like I was alone wasn't sure if I was going to see another day. I eventually was able to get on medication and therapy. But I was so low that I resorted to smoking weed. Weed was my only friend the only thing keeping me alive. I don't know how I am alive at this point. 

(Present Day)
I knew I needed to move home to heal. Luckily I have a supportive family who loves me and have welcomed me with open arms. I am still on my medication and going to therapy. I also picked up a part-time job at a retail store close to my house. I wish I handled things differently but it's the reality I am currently living. I am way better then I was a few months ago. Some days are hard. I don't know what the future holds. I want to be successful but I don't have a direction I feel like a failure in a way. I am glad I am alive I thought I was going to die. I don't want to be in retail forever. 

Any advice?"
1410,depression,how do i see a psychiatrist,"over the past 6 years, i often experience some phases lasting a few weeks to a few months and during those periods i can't control my own emotions, i get annoyed by every small thing and i keep crying throughout the day. i also shut my friends out and don't feel like talking to anyone. my appetite is also horrible and i don't eat a bowl of rice per day. however, it doesn't really affect my work and i'm kind of a workaholic, so people around me think i'm normal (hopefully).

i also always feel anxious and have had a few attacks. recently, i sought help from a local non-profit organization and i've been going for free counselling for a year. sometimes it helps but sometimes it doesn't, so even though i'm slightly better at managing these phases, it still happens and affects my daily life.

my friends are forcing me to see a psych because they think i should get a diagnosis and meds and a part of me wants to because i want to get better but a part of me doesn't want to because i feel like it's a waste of money and it's going to be very difficult to convince my parents (i'm 17 y/o, singaporean). i can't go by myself because i'm broke but my parents wouldn't bring me because they aren't even willing to bring me to a doctor for my physical issues (i'm experiencing nerve pain in my leg and if it continues i think i might become cripple). any issue/sickness i have, they tell me to drink water and take a walk in the park as if that will make me magically feel better.

my parents fight multiple times everyday since i was young and there was a point of time they wanted to divorce and i think it has affected me so i always try to handle my own things myself.

i'm also used to feeling depressed and anxious because i've been dealing with it just fine (maybe not) for the past 6 years.

i'm thinking of telling my parents one more time but if it doesn't work i'll have to starve, save up and go by myself at a later time. i honestly don't know what to do at this point, i'm so lost.

i feel like a crazy person, sorry that this post is all over the place."
1411,depression,20 years of this and I’m so tired,I don’t have a lot to say that I haven’t before. 20+ years of depression and I’m exhausted. I always have been but tonight I’m just out of spoons. Any positivity would help. SOS

1413,depression,I’m extremely lonely and depressed in college,"I’m 24 and in my junior year of college (took some time to think about what I wanted to do). I am so unbelievably lonely. I see everyone hanging with friends, having fun, and it’s a pain I’ve never felt before in my life. I want so bad to know people. To have people to hangout with. To meet friends. To meet girls. But idk how. I have a fair bit of social anxiety, but aside from that I just don’t know an acceptable way to meet people. I’m also struggling with my looks a lot. I’m the heaviest I’ve ever been and it’s getting to a point that I get sick when I see my body in the mirror. I am not an attractive person, I have a fucked up teeth gap. Idk. I don’t know what to do. I just want people to be comfortable around. I want friends. I want to experience college. I’m so sad.

Can someone give me some advice or talk to me?"
1414,depression,I feel disconnected from everyone,"Things haven't been going well at home, at work, or else where for that matter. I'm so fucking tired all the time. I can't seem to make anyone happy. I'm considering leaving and not coming back."

I can't be in for my first therapy session until October and it wouldn't be worth it anyways because there is no world in which I can be honest with a therapist. This is why I know that my life was always going to end with me taking my life. I don't try to get better so I won't, even if I want to somewhere inside of me. I need to die."

It's gotten to the point that I became sick. I currently feel the effects of depression now, my own family hasn't always treated me the best but I miss my home."
1417,depression,"I’m sad, I feel like I need a friend","I’ve been crying all day neglecting my collage work because I feel really lonely, I feel like I have no one to talk too. Yeah I have “friends” from high school but we never go out of our way to talk, and those conversations usually end quick. I have a boyfriend and He has friends that he goes to hang out with but I’m here at the end of the day by myself. Yeah it’s nice for him to ask me if he can hang out with his friends but it’s been everyday now and he only spend times with me when we eating something which last about 50 mins and then he ask if he could leave and go to his friends and play games. I don’t think it would be that much of a problem if I had friends, like yeah he likes to invite me to play with them but they aren’t my friends. It would be cool to have someone that I could talk to that cared about me and could distract me from myself. I’m just so sad. I need help, I don’t want to rely on my boyfriend being my only friend , especially when we argue and then not talk cause he can just have fun with his friends, while I on the other hand suffer and cries the whole day"
1418,depression,Should I stay?,"Please someone help me. I'm so conflicted. I've (21F) been with my boyfriend (27M) for about a year now, we've been living together for several months and have become co-dependent. I've noticed that he has some anger/emotional issues and they have been greatly affecting me. There are times where he drives recklessly, yells, gets angry at the dogs, slams things, or generally expresses his anger outwardly. He's scared me on multiple occasions, yet he is simultaneously my only source of emotional support. I was in denial about it for a long time and didn't tell anyone (not even my therapist) out of fear that they would make me break up with him or tell me to leave.

He apologized for his behavior and has committed to going to therapy but I'm not sure if it's smart to get back into the relationship (as it takes time to heal/change). Each person I've talked to has given contradicting advice, although most voted to have a clean breakup. Many have pointed out the red flags and it's making me second guess a lot of the relationship (was it manipulation? Was I stuck in a submissive role?). I think it's a mix of a lot of different things... (or am I still in denial about how toxic it was?).

My logic is that if he could control it, he would have stopped, meaning he needs time to work on it. Thus, it would be illogical to jump back into a relationship without giving him enough time to work on himself in therapy. My therapist recommended taking some time apart, although that can translate into many different things (distance? a break? a breakup? etc).

We've spent the past couple of weeks apart on weird talking terms and I just want to figure out what I should do. I've never been more confused, hurt, and alone in my entire life. I don't know what to believe anymore.

I guess I'm just trying to figure out if I should still try and make it work.

All advice is greatly appreciated and I'm more than happy to answer any questions (since this is a relatively short post).

Thank you for listening. Sending my love to whoever is reading."
1419,depression,Yep. I’ve officially lost my mind.,"I’ve done irreversible damage now. 

Basically I’m 31 and have a weird fucking relationship with my multi millionaire parents where they will help me survive if I’m on the edge of death, but not actually help me thrive- it’s been this way forever, I am not trying to sound like a petulant manchild (although I get it if you see it that way). 

I’m homeless right now. But my dad lets me sleep in his workshop in the middle of town. I’ve been here 2 months since I left a sober living where I had a 20 y/o felon as a roommate that was always threatening me. I’ve drank on and off, tonight is on, and I have an extreme rage towards my parents. Words won’t do it justice but my mother is a narcissist Karen at levels you can’t comprehend. I’ve developed anger issues in the past few months after having maintained a relatively calm and cool demeanor through all the bullshit.

Well tonight I am just done I guess. I scribbled “That’ll be the last car you ever own”- something my dad said to me when I decided to sell my car when I was struggling financially- behind a plaque hanging on the wall. I have punched a small hole in the bathroom wall. I put a few small cuts on my wrist because I’m too much a pussy to go deeper and just fucking die but I’ve left a blood soaked napkin on the table next to his switchblade.

I am done. I am done living this life. I am ready to commit suicide. I just need one more thing to go wrong."

I might be bored. I don’t really have any interests at the moment. I’m not looking forward to anything. I don’t have any goals. I’m not working towards anything. I’m not motivated to do anything. 

I just feel empty. 

I’ve battled depression my whole life, but I’ve been in a really really good place for a few months now. In general, I feel I’ve turned a corner, but sometimes like tonight, I just hit with a wave of anxiety and emptiness."

1427,depression,depression+shitty uncontrollable life circumstances,"hi. 22 yr old diagnosed at 17. we all know that depression is bad enough, chemical imbalance and all…but couple that with some genuinely shit circumstances (auto immune disease, medical debt, car accident, 5th year senior due to medical issues, no support system, poverty) and it’s like fighting an uphill battle with no relief. i’ve been trying to be positive, to “manifest” and work hard. i’ve tried to be strong, to think of better days, be grateful for what little i have. it’s just…i can’t believe how “unlucky” i am. sometimes all i can do is laugh, really. life is just so exhausting. i feel like i’m completely defined by my shortcomings, and no matter how hard i try to overcome these challenges, i just get dragged down even lower than before. i’m not a religious person, but i know at this point, i need a fucking miracle or my misery will kill me before i even hit my mid 20s."
1428,depression,I may not be “unlovable”. But I’m pretty sure I’m incapable of feeling loved.,"My parents were pretty emotionally distant and demanding growing up. My dad was a military man, and a preacher. He had very specific ideas about the right way to do basically everything, and preached to us ad nauseam the importance of righteousness. My mom was… in hindsight I would say she was probably dealing with some trauma herself. She’s not a nurturing person, despite being the stay at home mother who raised me and my brothers and sisters.

When my wife and I started dating, she had to initiate physical contact. Hugging was never something my family ever did growing up. When I went to college and people were hugging each other, I was honestly confused. It’s become this joke in our marriage about how she had to teach me how to hug.

Rationally, I know there are people in my life who love me. My parents would say they love me, though they have always been abysmal at expressing that in any meaningful way. I’m sure my wife loves me, though it seems like half the time we’re just tolerating each other, or too busy coping with the firehose of bullshit that is adult life. I have three kids. I’m sure they love me, though it really feels like most of the time I’m with them they are literally screaming at me. I guess I have friends who would probably say they love me, but I don’t really see any friends ever. My siblings would say they love me. I don’t see them very often. 

While writing this, my son came up and asked if we could cuddle. I should feel warmth at this. I put my kids to bed tonight. They all hugged and kissed me and told me they loved me. But I just don’t feel it. I feel tired and empty.

My brain doesn’t feel or think positive, nice things about itself. I really, really don’t have those neural pathways. I also don’t know what to do about that. I don’t like myself, or enjoy my life."

I am worthless
I am meaningless
I am nothing 
I am unlovable 
I am undeserving 
I am a burden and a nuisance 

My marriage is in ruins because of my anger, depression, and anxiety. He shut down years ago. He doesn't see how that fed into where I am at now. He doesn't see that the emotional withholding he has done for years and years and years has eroded me to the point of nothingness. My soul is heavy yet empty. A black hole of sorrow. His pointing at my already known flaws only make me want to punish myself more. I was invisible to him unless I came in like a storm. Full of fury and pain. Now that is the cause of these ruins. 

Our beautiful life was built on lies. He never really loved me. If he did he wouldn't have cheated from the start. He wouldn't have become a ghost while standing next to me. An empty shell of a man who shows me no emotion. A man who seeks out emotional connections in friends and other women but never me. I shouldn't be surprised, no one can love me forever. I am only good enough for temporary. 

I am stupid
I am fat
I am lazy
I am ugly
I am disgusting 

A lifetime of not being enough. A lifetime of failure. A lifetime of being used. A lifetime of being disposable. I have suffered trauma after trauma and am too weak to grow the f*** up and move on. Instead it weighs me down. The tendrils of my  shame and guilt. Of pain and fear pull me further into oblivion. 

Trauma calls for me in every fiber of my being. A mocking menace whispering screams of my internal agony. Burning hot skin meets the cold blade of steel.  Moon pale skin with raised trails of these broken dreams. Ruby ribbons of tears streak across the white fields of flesh. A moment of physical releases let's me escape from this internal damnation. 

The echoes of all I have seen. Of all I have felt burned themselves into my very existence. I deserved it all. The wandering greedy hands of my friends brother when I was seven. I had a crush and must have let myself be lured by his charm. 

The constant shouts of my stupidity from my father. The sudden quick lash of his violence. A smack on the head. A kick to the chest. Rare but oh so sudden.. Like lightning on a blue sky day. I dared be born a girl thus I was less lovable than his son. If I didn't screw up he wouldn't need to show me the ways.

The disappointed teachers who never saw my actions a cry for help but instead me being defiant and a brat. The isolation in a locked room. The burn of shame on my face as they scold me yet again. I should have just used my words instead of being an impossible little shit. 

Waking in the purple darkness of dawn naked in his dorm room sore and confused. Sneaking out like a thief with stolen shorts and crumpled shirt. Feeling a sickness I've never known before as I pass his door again and again and again to see my underwear hanging there, a flag of my slutiness. The words of confusion tumbling from my mouth to friends and campus counselors only to be told I was mistaken. I am saying this because I have regret. Causing me to question my own sanity. The blame is at my feet. Even a friend with a Coke can't be trusted. 

I am a whore

In the past I was nothing. Today it's the same. Nothing has changed but the physical vessel carrying the burdens of all my yesterday's. Now I am failing not just myself but those I love the most. 

I am a bad daughter
I am a bad sister
I am a bad friend
I am a bad wife
the worst of it all is 
I am am bad mother

My children deserve more than me. I don't want to ruin them. I wake everyday to do better and I always fall short. I know tonight I wallow in these thoughts but tomorrow I will rise because I can't destroy their lives by catastrophically leaving. 

I know if my husband reads this he will only hate me more. I just need to speak these words to someone other than myself. I am here. This is me trying."
1447,depression,Battling depression on and off.,"I have been struggling with depression on and off for the past 4-5 years, can't really say how long, but it has gotten even worse for the past year.

A little back story, in the country I love in mental health is not really consider an issue, people just say ""put your head up and it will off be fine"" , or "" just man up there's nothing wrong with you"", ""stop talking bullshit and start working"", no one really exempts the fackt that depression is a real issue. I am a 30 year old male, I have a somewhat good job with good pay, company car that is all payed for and included gas for personal use aswell, but the issue is I don't really get days off, I am always working. I just might be burned out by now, but the reality of it is, that even if I am not at work I am constantly thinking of work, what I did wrong what could have been done better why didn't I do it like this or that, it makes my life miserable, I have turned to alcohol, and not really sleeping all too well aswell, I can't really stop myself from drinking, and that is just not good for me. I have limited my contacts with friends I am not reliable for myself or for my friends and family, I just don't see a point in continuing to do anything...

P. S I know this post is not really constructed but I just needed to say all these things, since there is no one to say them to..."

I did everything for her, when she needed a shoulder to cry on I was there, when people disrespected her I made sure they stopped. I made sure she was always happy. But it’s like, no matter how hard I try I’ll never be enough. I just want to be happy. I did everything for this girl, I’ve sacrificed so much for her all for her to leave me. Why couldn’t I be enough? All I do is fuck up. Sorry about this all, it’s just a bunch of random shit put together. I’m just tired of living."
1450,depression,My best friend is severely depressed and quit her meds cold turkey and isn’t acting like herself *TW*,"I don’t know how to help her. We have been best friends for YEARS. We even loved together as roommates for quite a few. She has struggled with depression basically her whole life. I have always been a support system for her. And I thought I had seen her bad episodes (I knew her when she almost made an attempt) but I have never seen anything like this. 

Unfortunately we don’t live together any more but I try to visit or talk on the phone as much as possible and she changed. She is still honest to me about her symptoms for the most part which I appreciate as it makes it easier for me to help her but I don’t know what to. She has been suicidal the past three months, isolating her self from friends and family (only talking to me because I make her and that was hard to do) she hasn’t been eating and has been nearly fainting at work as a result, she has no regard for future consequences (she was fine with the potential of going to jail) she is not keeping up with basic life necessities and is completely reliant on her boyfriend to survive (it’s not an abusives relationship he really cares about her but I believe they may be codependent). 

She stated that her dissociation and suicidal thoughts have gotten worse so she decided to quit her meds last week. She was on a very high dose and was on this led for over a year. Not something you can just quit without talking to a doctor. 

When she was really down I sent her the numbers to some local crisis lines and she got mad at me saying she can’t afford to be hospitalized. I told her they are just numbers to talk and are free they can’t hospitalize you but she didn’t want to hear it. 

I don’t know what do. In the last bad period a few years ago where she almost attempted I was able to get her to go to therapy and it was really helping for a while. But now she is isolating herself from even her therapist. I am absolutely terrified that I am going to get a call that I was too late and that she is gone. 

Is there anything I can do?"

1455,depression,I’m in a bad place at the moment,"I guess I just want to put my thoughts out into the void, but also think I need the positive feedback. 

I’m in NSW (Australia) and the entire state is in lockdown. I imagine the way I’m feeling is pretty indicative for most at the moment. I have two jobs and I am unable to work at either at the moment as they are both retail and deemed inessential. I’m beginning to worry that one of them may close as it is a small business and my boss is seriously struggling. 

For the last week and a half, I’ve felt sad every day. There were little glimmers of normalcy, but an overarching misery. Something snapped last night though and now I oddly feel nothing. I’m not happy, but I’m not sad either. I just feel totally impartial to everything, I don’t know how to explain it. I just have nothing to say to anyone, I don’t want to do anything. Nothing makes me feel really angry or annoyed like it did, like traffic, but nothing makes me feel happy or excited either, like buying food. There’s just nothing. 

I live with my boyfriend and I’ve just been feeling so lonely and disconnected from him at the moment. Most nights he’s lying up the other end of the couch cuddling our dog and I don’t know how to tell him how desperately I need a cuddle. Last time I did he laughed because he thinks I’m jealous of the dog, which I guess I am, which is so stupid. 

Ultimately, everything just feels so endless and futile. I feel so trapped. We’re all living in limbo. I can’t make any plans or decisions to get out of this mental rabbit hole because no one knows what’s happening or when there will be a light at the end of the tunnel."
1456,depression,How do I convince myself to eat sth?,"I nearly lost all appetite and therefore don't really eat anything, which really doesn't help my depression.

1459,depression,……..,Its sad you know…. My own friend stab in the back then left. My family just now ignores me tell they need something…. Now the one item I had left to keep me moving is long gone. And it is my fault. I lost it and now the hope I had is long gone…. The funny thing is I try to get help from the last 3 years each time I get thrown away. First time they did care then just forget about it never got the help i need. Second time Covid hit making it hard to ask anyone… 3rd time…… hurt. To be honest im at the end. I think about death. All i want is death.. All i want is to sleep and never wake up. And these pills making it vary hard to say no. Idk were im getting at with this but ik no one going read this sob story. I guess to get some thoughts down depending on the path I choose to take tonight. If someone did read it i hope you can find help and not end up like me….
1460,depression,I’m the biggest disappointment in the world,"I hate myself for the following reasons: I’m lazy, I don’t have a passion in life. My biggest fear in life is my parents hating me. Not in the sense that they kick me out and leave me homeless etc. that won’t happen. In the sense that they hate me as a person. I’m not like them, they do everything fast and quick, and do it well. My dad started from nothing and managed to give me a wonderful life. Me on the other hand, I had everything handed to me and I couldn’t do anything with it. I’m 20 and I hate myself. I wish I wanted to go to college, and if not, I wish I had some kind of talent so I could build my life around it. Sadly I don’t, there’s gonna be a day in my near future where my parents begin to look at me as the worlds biggest failure and that they regret having me or wish they had a kid who wasn’t useless. The bar was never set high for me, but I couldn’t even do the bare minimum. All I do is cry all day in my room but my parents haven’t noticed because I lock myself and I cry silently. I just need this feeling to go away. It’s so scary to think that life is just one big disappointment. Maybe I was wired this way or maybe I fucked it up.

1462,depression,about beauty,"well, I have this little monologue about the word I love and hate.

Sometimes I think about what beautiful is, who taught you the reader,who taught me what beautiful is.All I see is that I am far from beautiful and those Instagram people I see are breathtakingly beautiful sometimes it makes me cry looking at them so I don't. Social media has,at least on me burned those two or three stereotypes of perfect beauty and of course I am like most p

eople not them.I wonder if I was those having popularly celebrated features, If I know myself correctly wouldn't have been writing this. But really what is beauty, what is physically attractive, I have many famous and normal people I find beautiful, but its not me, its just not me because I don't have that eyes, that jaw,that body that face.

Every time I look in the mirror, I try to make the reflection look but I can't, It doesn't stop looking anything but ugly. I use things to get that perfect skin ,hair and everything,but nothing works, I can't look at the mirror without despising what I see.

I would not mention my insecurities because it makes me feel like people will be out to get me, even they people who love and care about me beyond physical attraction, I never tell them because even when they do not care, I don't want any human to see and take notice. My loved ones try to tell me that external beauty doesn't matter and that I'm still pretty nevertheless but I cannot believe them when I try to.

People are obsessed with their beauty and I'm obsessed with my ugliness. Why am I so shallow for myself, why am I kind to everyone but me. At the end of the day, I hate to admit it but I wish I looked like those girls I want to be the universally accepted beautiful.

Anyone would tell me I'm one of the kindest and empathetic person they have met in a while but I'm shallow to me, I'm unkind to me. Frankly I hate me.

I'm not beautiful,and I believe I cant change that, I hate me and I cant change that, I hurt everyday when I see myself but I guess I can learn to live with that.

I'm just okay because I have beautiful souls that care for me. Guess I will keep writing sharing these hateful monologue to myself.

Thank you for reading."

1470,depression,Still trying to cope with my best friend’s suicide,"Hey guys, pretty much what the title says. I’d like to provide some context though. 

I guess one could say I’m a “veteran” of mental illness; I’ve been dealing with panic disorder and social anxiety with undiagnosed depression (which I believed to be a byproduct of my anxiety) for about 13 years. Throughout high school, my friend and I helped each other through very difficult and dark times. Both growing up as an only child, we eventually considered ourselves as brothers, given how much we’d see each other. This past summer I had come back from my final year in college to see him and about three weeks in, he took his own life. Of course at first it was VERY difficult; simply an assortment of emotions that is impossible to describe over text. I thought I had started to feel better about a month after… probably from all the drinking, but now everything is just going to shit. All I can feel now is hatred and sadness. The only times I can remotely feel happiness are for mundane, stupid things such as making a cool play in a video game in which the artificial happiness only lasts for a short time. I mentioned my experience with mental illness before, because I have dealt with all of this and felt as though I almost conquered it with no medication, but what I’ve been feeling recently is something much more intense and dark. Honestly never felt this lost in my life and I need help."

1473,depression,Can I be treated for depression without admitting I have suicidal thoughts to my doctor?,"For the first time in my life, I’m looking to get professional help and I’d like some advice based on other people’s experiences first.

My issue is that I don’t want to admit I have suicidal thoughts to anyone, not even the doctor I’m visiting in case my parents request a copy of my medical information. I also can’t go to therapy for it at the moment anyway and out of all other symptoms, I feel least emotionally ready to talk about that one or the attempt I’ve made in the past.

My parents are, for the most part, homeopathic and I’m listed as a dependent under their insurance plan. I’m both neglected and kept on a very tight leash if that makes sense… (E.g. only being taken to the dentist once my teeth were already heavily deteriorated.) I’m no longer a minor, but I still live with them and I can’t drive myself anywhere or maintain a job as I’m mentally crippledn nor do I have friends to help me.

I’ve managed to land a doctor’s visit under the guise of fainting from frequent migraines (which is true). My parents are paying for it, and fortunately they can’t tell the difference between a neurologist and a psychiatrist in case of a referral.

I’m planning to bring up depression to the doctor at the same time while using all personal my part-time money to pay for any separate medication. But will diagnosis or treatment change if I omit important facts like suicide? I want to quickly get better, focus, and leave this place. I can’t afford be locked by my parents.

I know next to nothing about going to the doctor’s. So maybe none of this is a valid concern…?

Also how do these things go?? Growing up in a homeopathic environment has left me clueless."

I don’t think this has always happened to me, so I’m curious about other peoples’ experiences.

1480,depression,What's the Point?: A Cureless Existence.,"Clinical depression is an imbalance of chemicals in your brain that causes depression.
We have way to measure the levels of these chemicals.
We don't know what the ""good level"" is (supposedly its different for everyone?)
We have no idea how much a given dosage of a given drug is going to affects the levels in someone's brain.
And even if you're lucky enough to get on a drug dose that works...there's a high chance you'll have to stay on it forever and even a chance that it will become ineffective and you will have to be put something else.
Honestly, I am just tired of it...I don't want to deal with it anymore because it is exhausting.
And being told that you will mostly likely be dealing with something you have no control over for the rest if your life makes me wonder: is it even worth it?"

I hate myself so much I wish I could just tell someone how much I’m hurting. I want to feel loved so badly, I want to feel better so fucking much. I have literally no idea how to tell my friends how much I really really really want to die and how much it affects me. I don’t want to seem like an asshole when I don’t respond bc I’m having a panic attack but I don’t want to tell them it was a panic attack bc I feel like they’ll hate me and think I’m sneaking attention.

I’ve been told my anxiety is not anxiety. I’ve been told that if I just prayed more my life would be better, but I spent the first 21 years of my life praying for a better life and nothing ever happened, so what am I supposed to do when my depression peaks again and I’m left laying in my room wishing for nothing but the sweet release of death?"

I can't believe how my parents let me be that way, they probably thought they were doing a good job by letting me act however I wanted, but not once did they think of how it would affect me in the future. I keep overhearing them talking about how I hate myself and why I'm so anxious around other people. I don't hate myself. I just hate my past and everyone around me.

Ever since my friend brought it up I've been thinking a lot more about how everyones better and prettier than me or how I'll never be good enough. And I've only been seeing other people's success and being jealous of them. 

I realized that the reason I don't have any new friends is because they haven't had time to form an emotional bond with me and that's why they have had such an easy time leaving me, unlike my old friends. I'm a burden to everyone around me and I won't be able to change for as long as I'm still stuck here in my shitty town with my shitty memories. I wish I could break free from everyone I know and get to meet new people with other backgrounds from other places. I want to feel independent for once and not be treated like I'm stupid. My only options are to run away, kill myself, or continue to suffer like this for about 5-6 years and then kill myself because I'm still gonna be worthless."

1496,depression,Not sure where else to turn,"I’ve been depressed pretty much my whole life (or at least that I can remember). In my 30s and made no progress. As an adult I went through multiple diagnoses such as learning I’m autistic, I have ADD and OCD. I often wonder if getting diagnosed as autistic late in life contributed to the depression. I don’t know. All I do know is that it’s getting worse. I don’t want to go into too many details but I’m going through something in my life that has caused so much anxiety and stress that I can’t emotionally process it all. I often cry every night. I’ve even called the National Suicide Hotline and just cried. My therapist has been no help and was even confrontational to the point where I had to end the professional relationship. My psychiatrist doesn’t want me to try the new FDA medication approved for depression as I have been labeled treatment resistant. My family blows me off. My brother (who has a masters in school psychology) told me to stop being a p***y. Saying that I can just get over it and cited “studies.” But the next few months could decide the rest of my life. The medical community doesn’t want to help, nor family or friends. Who do I turn to? People I don’t know on the internet. Why is that? I’m crying out for help and I’m pretty much being told to be silent. Why is it hard to get help?  The one thing that puts a smile on my face is my dog. She’s my emotional support animal and has been there for me more than any human being. She’s the reason I fight every day. It’s sad though. I’m still alone. What do I do next?"
1497,depression,What would you do if you had a year left to live?,I’m not sick or dying but what would you do if you were going to die in a year’s time? Sometimes I wish I was so I could just let go of all this meaningless societal pressure like working a dead end job or anything like that. Just cut loose with life and enjoy what you can while you can. Society has no use for a broken cog so nobody will be at odds with you wanting to spend the last year of your life doing what you want. Plus you’d have a reason to die that isn’t suicide and you’re family would have time to accept it. I guess I just wish life wasn’t a long term thing. Strange but it makes sense in my head
1498,depression,Overwhelmed by the idea of having to live life,"I don’t know if this is more depression or anxiety related. I guess a mix of both since they often go hand in hand.  I am overwhelmed by life. But not really my own life circumstances, overall my life is pretty relaxed and heading in a good direction. Yet thinking about actually having to live my life feels overwhelming to me and can cause me to break down. I’m not suicidal, death is one of my biggest fears in fact. But I do sometimes wish I didn’t exist. I feel like I can’t handle life.  Maybe I am really just overwhelmed by living a life with depression and life itself isn’t the problem. I’m not sure. Let me know if you can relate, I’ve been feeling very alone recently."
1499,depression,"Just Waiting for the End, Can't Make Heads or Tails of What is Happening in my Head Most Days.","I'm 29 and I've been dealing with suicidal depression since middle school and it's reaching a point that I'm screaming inside every day but have no clue how to externalize or relieve my anxiety. Everything makes me wildly angry, my fuse is extremely short, and I hold everyone to a standard that I don't even reach myself. I have a wonderful life and our friends and family care about me...but I just want to close my eyes and never wake up.

I was raised in privileged isolation; I attended public schools but I never made any friends and all I did with 100% of my time is play video games (my setup was a pc monitor next to my bed. For months at a time I would literally just lay in bed all day, smoke pot, play games, and wallow in self pity. It was like a coffin. I lost my mind there). My parents didn't have any involvement in my life beyond telling me how fucking lazy and crazy I was. They never pushed me to pursue anything and just let me quit whenever I wanted. Now that I'm older I realize I'm INCREDIBLY maladjusted to society. When people ask me what I'm like I say ""you know Yoda on dagobah when he was full on hermit? That's me"".

I recently failed my second big job and had to go back to pizza delivery. I feel like a fucking loser. And now I don't even like video games anymore. Like, my one fucking vice in life and now I can't even bring myself to touch my favorite games.

I don't even know why I'm doing this. I don't know what to do. I'm screaming in my head every day. I want to cry all the time. I feel like I'm going crazy, my aggression is out of control. I want to just disappear. I feel like my one shot at this life was sabotaged by my parents. I'm almost 30 and I'm a God damned pizza boy. I'm a smart guy. I'm capable of so much more. But I lack the emotional stability to pursue anything substantial.

I'm sorry reddit, I know my shit sounds so trivial compared to what some of you go through but I don't know what to do. I just want to throw myself head first off my 4th floor balcony every day and the screaming inside is quickly becoming not enough to get me to the next day. I don't know how to be okay with who I am. 

You know what else?? I have a wife! A beautiful, loving, supportive, successful, caring wife!! The shame that I can't make her the queen she deserves to be fucks me up so much.

Reddit please tell me something. Please tell me there is some way to get therapy for free. I want to talk to a professional so bad, I feel like I'm slipping into madness every day, I barely have control of my own mind, I need help. I don't know what to do. I'm desperate. I don't even know what I need I'm fucking losing it.

I'm sorry for the long post of rambling, I really just don't know what to do anymore and this is a desperate reach for some help. And please, if I offend anyone because my shit doesn't seem important there is a whole mountain of anguish in my head I'm dealing with. I don't know how to communicate these things and I certainly have no clue how to deal with them."

I want the pain to stop. What will help. What will make the pain go away. It hurts so much. I’m sorry I keep giving our trauma holders so much pain but I can’t take it anymore. I feel so bad all the time. It’s frustrating, having the power to kill myself at any time but always stopping myself. It’s so exhausting. Good thing I signed up for insurance which will give me a good amount of money refunded if I try to kill myself during college. If I die, will they give back 100%? I don’t want my parents to have to lose all that money because of me. Crying doesn’t really help. I still feel bad. I need to listen to this song on repeat or else the thoughts will come back and I can’t handle it. Why won’t they switch out with me. Why do I have to be in front and take it all. Why do I have to be a human punching bag. I hate that whenever I feel bad I start to dissociate. I can’t feel sad for long but it’s intense and feels like it lasts forever. I want to die. I want this pain to go away. Please help me. It hurts it hurts so much. It hurts so much please save me. Why why why me. I feel so bad every night. Every night for 6 years I have to hurt so much. I haven’t felt happy in so long. What does happiness feel like. What does it mean to be happy. I’m so sad I want to kill myself i want to die I want this pain to go away why do I have to hurt so much what did I do to deserve this why do you hate me so much why won’t you let me be in peace. Why do you hate me why do I have to stay why won’t you let me die why do you want me to suffer for eternity what did I do to you why can’t I die. She always comes out when I’m doing badly I’m so sorry L I don’t mean to put you through so much pain you’re only a child I’m only a child I’m just a kid why do you hate me."
1506,depression,I wish I weren’t such a failure…,"I wish I weren’t a failure.  I wish I weren’t so stupid.  I wish I hadn’t made so many mistakes in my life.

I wish I could go back in time and redo things.  All these regrets are a perpetual burden. All these abusers are a slow poison.

I’m really tired."
1507,depression,Last Night I Begged Myself to Never Wake Up,"**I'm so tired. Nothing Ever works. Every wrong thing makes me feel like I'm being laughed at by an invisible audience.** 

I am going through a lot of emotional and mental trauma. 

Most of it, I practically blame myself. I don't know if that's better or worse as if I try to blame it on something else, I feel like I'm being ignorant. 

But the summation of this was basically I felt trapped in my environment. I didn’t feel like I could be happy, I barely even felt like I could keep “me” glued together. I was taking my life day by day, sometimes hour by hour. Just because I couldn’t even think further ahead than that. And I basically watched as weeks and months pass by as I slowly disassociated from myself. I didn’t even really recognize myself after a certain point because I’ve fallen so out of all of my hobbies, out of all of my habits, of all my social groups that I didn’t even really recognize the life I was living. 

&amp;#x200B;

What can I even do?

I'm lonely so I go on dating apps (Tinder, Hinge, etc) but then all it  equals to is just validation that no one likes. (Yes I know maybe my profile needs work or I need pictures but what's the point) 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of trying and ruining everything I touch. I push away people who no longer want any part of me. (I miss them, I miss the memories) 

&amp;#x200B;

WHEN DOES IT STOP?? 

&amp;#x200B;

Some days I get hit with these disabilities sadness. It usually consist of me remembering a good part of my life.. I really miss her :/ BUT I would remember these good memories and then I would look at what I have now and I would just pause. 

&amp;#x200B;

Like imagine stubbing your toe but in your brain. 

&amp;#x200B;

I would try to think of something, anything, just to suppress the pain but it hurts. And it hurts worse every time I remember.  

&amp;#x200B;

**DO ANTIDEPRESENTS STOP THESE GOOD MEMORIES FROM COMING????**

&amp;#x200B;

Sigh, what is the point of typing this. There is not salvation for me."
1508,depression,I know it’s not me but I blame myself,"I just need to rant.

My boyfriend won’t spend time with me.  We live together but he would rather play video games. From the time he wakes up to the time we go to sleep, even with me working all day and asking him to spend time with me afterward and snuggle, he still just waddles off and goes and plays. He doesn’t even tell me he’s going to leave to go play. I ask him what he’s doing and he avoids the question. He only comes out when something interests him. I specifically asked him to snuggle. I wanted attention. We haven’t had sex in 5 days and I can count the kisses I’ve gotten in the past week. We don’t snuggle before bed either, he will literally just say he’s laying down and roll over and fall asleep quickly while I’m stuck with my insomnia unless I’m drunk enough to pass out without thinking about it. You know what he told me before I went to work? I said he was going to play games all day while I was gone, he said he was but also maybe clean. Lol. Maybe. Nope. Couldn’t even be bothered to take the trash out that’s been sitting there for days. Couldn’t be bothered to check on our cat who had surgery last Wednesday. Can’t be bothered to fucking give me attention even when I have to fucking ask for it like a charity case."

1511,depression,"If you get birthday blues, why?",[removed]
1512,depression,Depression after rehoming dog.,"About a month ago I adopted a dog from the shelter and felt like I was totally ready and able to care for it. For reference I have suffered with undiagnosed depression, anxiety and PTSD. After a couple days the excitement had leveled off and the puppy blues began to set in. They hit hard and fast and my anxiety had hit a level I hadn’t seen in years. It was worsened by the fact that every time I left the house, wether for 30 mins or 2 hours, she would bark and cry and if left long enough she would work herself into throwing up or diarrhea. I tried everything to try and calm her, but nothing seemed to work. Between that and my own anxiety, I came to the heartbreaking decision to rehome her after a couple weeks. Long story short, I have been in contact with the family who took her and found out she’s been doing so so so much better because they have another dog she can be with while they’re gone. She must’ve been raised with other dogs because she would never settle down with me.

While I’m so happy that she’s doing so good, I’m not doing very well myself. The first few days were horrible. I could barely bring myself to get out of bed and do something. But every day I kept getting better until last night when I hit another low. No matter what I tried I couldn’t get myself to snap out of it. It took everything to not get her spare collar out and just clinch it in my hands and cry.

I think my depression stems from seeing how well she is doing and wondering why I couldn’t give her that. Why could it not have been me. It felt like everything was meant to be until it wasn’t. And it was soul crushing. It still is. It feels like I will never get over this. There is a part of me that wants her back but I know that is the wrong thing for everyone. She is loved, she is safe, and her anxiety has been helped. I can’t take that from her, or take her from that. Every day I wake up and part of me misses waking up with her there. I see her sitting by the back door waiting to be let out. Standing by the pantry to try and get a treat. I hear her collar and tag clinking against her food bowl. I even miss going out in the middle of the night to make sure she went pee before bed. How does one move past this?"
1513,depression,I genuinely feel like I've tried everything...,"I just don't know what to do at this point. I've tried therapy, which helped for awhile but now I'm just too afraid to say anything to her. I've tried medication, which sometimes I feel works but... well idk. I've tried raising my grades, doing something with my life, finding a passion... none if it has made me happy... I just don't know what to do at this point. I always end up back here, in this hole."
1514,depression,i need a bit of advice,"
hi guys, i’m 20 years old and i have depression pretty bad i guess but, the weird thing is i’m never really sad, i don’t cry i never break down, but i’m always upset and i really don’t know what to do about it. i always see my friends and people i know break down crying about how sad they are and i feel like i don’t “really have depression” because i don’t get that. i just always have an impending feeling of being alone and being unwanted and shit and i don’t really know what to do bc when people try to get close i feel like i subconsciously push them away. In a sense it kind of feels like i’m creating a prison of being alone and i don’t really know what to do, anyone have any tips?"
1515,depression,Idk just need a place to say stuff,"Roughly a year ago I started taking a more “proper” dosage to help deal with my depression, and for a while it did work Well in a way of limiting emotions and stuff. Hell I think I was on an upswing up until yesterday where it all came crashing down again. For the first time ever really I just got black out drunk, with a group of people and honestly I made excuses for the people I loved when in reality I just can’t deal with finding a fault in them. As someone who’s recently come to understand that sexuality and all that fun stuff isn’t black and white and is more of a grey-ish area ive fallen in love with quite a few people. All of whom either hurt me, left me or just never felt the Same. Two of the last people I love just started dating and both made it clear they don’t feel the same about me as I do them, I’m happy for them but at the same time I feel incredibly hurt. All I’ve wanted is to feel that someone who I love truly loves me back the same way and just knowing that no one I love does hurts a lot. Yet I keep going out with them and hanging out with them which only hurts me more. Not gonna hurt myself been there done that, and I feel like my only option is to get over it or cut them off. I really don’t feel like doing either. So random people on the internet who know very little of the entire context what do you think I should do. And to the like three people (if that ) that respond thanks"

1519,depression,Spouse depressed,"Are there any support groups for people who have a depressed spouse? We have two very small children, and I am trying everything I possibly can to relieve any sort of burden on my spouse. But the kids are so  so little, some days I need help. I want to be supportive so badly. I’m at a loss. This has been going on for several weeks. Twice, on particularly bad days with the kids, I’ve said to my spouse “I need you”. I can’t make it anymore clear than that. And my spouse is unable to be there for me. It hurts. I’m starting to get resentful. I don’t know what to do. 

If there is no such thing as a support group for people who have a depressed spouse…if you have been depressed what is some thing you wish your spouse would have done for you/what do you wish they would have understood? Bonus points if y’all have little kids."

1521,depression,Stuck in Between,"I’m currently getting off Zoloft. I’ve been battling depression my whole life. I only got on medication about 7 months ago. After a couple of months I was up to 100 mg. I felt so numb, but content. Then I got really uncomfortable with how content I was. With how okay I was just being content. Only being okay with where I was. No goals, just coasting. 

So now I am down to 25 mg a day. I have manic episodes where I throw out all my stuff. I want to spend all my money. I dyed my fucking hair black. I’m like a rampaged teenager wanting to rip out my brain. Other days I’m just… Merp. 

I just want to be happy again y’all. I try new things, work on new goals, try to be in routine. I have great friends (no one knows how the hell ive kept them around this long, I wouldn’t want to deal with me). I just want to feel like there is a better reason to wake up everyday. Instead of just coasting again?"

1524,depression,This passage from The Goldfinch made me feel weirdly validated,"“But depression wasn’t the word. This was a plunge encompassing sorrow and revulsion far beyond the personal: a sick, drenching nausea at all humanity and human endeavor from the dawn of time. The writhing loathsomeness of the biological order. Old age, sickness, death. No escape for anyone. Even the beautiful ones were like soft fruit about to spoil. And yet somehow people still kept fucking and breeding and popping out new fodder for the grave, producing more and more new beings to suffer like this was some kind of redemptive, or good, or even somehow morally admirable thing: dragging more innocent creatures into the lose-lose game. Squirming babies and plodding, complacent, hormone-drugged moms. Oh, isn’t he cute? Awww. Kids shouting and skidding in the playground with no idea what future Hells awaited them: boring jobs and ruinous mortgages and bad marriages and hair loss and hip replacements and lonely cups of coffee in an empty house and a colostomy bag at the hospital. Most people seemed satisfied with the thin decorative glaze and the artful stage lighting that, sometimes, made the bedrock atrocity of the human predicament look somewhat more mysterious or less abhorrent. People gambled and golfed and planted gardens and traded stocks and had sex and bought new cars and practiced yoga and worked and prayed and redecorated their homes and got worked up over the news and fussed over their children and gossiped about their neighbors and pored over restaurant reviews and founded charitable organizations and supported political candidates and attended the U.S. Open and dined and travelled and distracted themselves with all kinds of gadgets and devices, flooding themselves incessantly with information and texts and communication and entertainment from every direction to try to make themselves forget it: where we were, what we were. But in a strong light there was no good spin you could put on it. It was rotten top to bottom. Putting your time in at the office; dutifully spawning your two point five; smiling politely at your retirement party; then chewing on your bedsheet and choking on your canned peaches at the nursing home. It was better never to have been born—never to have wanted anything, never to have hoped for anything.”

1525,depression,Lockdown loneliness,"I just feel lonely from the lack of contact with other people besides my family. There's a lot of an other stuff that gets to me but really the fact that I barely go outside anymore is just telling. Even when I go outside I don't know what to do. Most of my friends are busy with other stuff and it's like what can I really do. Doesn't help that I am also awkward.

1531,depression,"on the verge of something good, overwhelming sense of doom","I broke up with my first girlfriend almost 3 years ago. Since then I haven’t met anyone I felt anything for - one hookup, no relationships. Last weekend I went out with a girl and I’m crazy for her. I’m seeing her again this Friday. I want to be excited but all I can do is replay our first date in my head over and over and dwell on all the parts where I felt like I fucked up. It didn’t go bad, but I didn’t do any kind of flirting or escalation that it feel like a date. I don’t know how.

She was the one who asked me out, and I can point to things that happened on the date that, in hindsight, signal that she likes me. But that doesn’t have any affect on how I actually feel about this. I feel like I’ve already blown it by not being great on the first date. I’m anticipating her cancelling. Even though she had plenty of outs when we were planning it over text, and she took none of them.

It all just feels so tenuous. With my one girlfriend, we texted constantly. Even after the first date, we’d exchange a few messages a day. With this girl, it’s maybe one message every few days. And I’m restraining myself, because I don’t have anything to say. I’ve been through this enough times to know texting with nothing to say is how you fuck things up.

I’ve just always had such bad luck with this shit that I always feel failure coming. I didn’t get my first girlfriend until I was 23. Everything before that was rejection either before or after a first date. I feel like I’m back in college. I’ve been walking around my apartment, doing housework, constantly on the verge of tears. I’m so fucking twisted up about this. I don’t know how I’ll deal with it if I fuck this up. Or if I already fucked this up. I’m tired of being lonely. The days after I realized how much I liked her I felt like a human being with a reason to live for the first time in 3 years. I don’t want to go back."

1538,depression,Im ready to give up on everything,"I am actually feeling like this because of this event which triggered it (with a big impact on myself in entirety) 

Long story short I met a guy who was 49 at the time on social media, i was fresh out of high school at 19. Fast forward to 2021, i moved to another city for school (which was the same city that he lived in) Me and him dated but it wasnt for long, i really cared for him &amp; loved him. 

Last week, him and fiancée was like “ hey we were wondering if you wanted to come after work for some fun” basically I went over their house and we all had sex with each other. 

Atferwards we were texting each other for a couple of days. Until one day, they decided they wanted a break from me to work on their “relationship issues”.  Hearing that made me very depressed &amp; felt like i was used/embarrassed on purpose. 

When i asked about what i did wrong he was like “ you were being thristy &amp; went overboard with the love you stuff” my reaction was like , what? I was never thristy and with the love stuff yea did do that; i literally thought she wanted a relationship with me she was saying love u babe and stuff.  


I just need admit to myself the truth, 

I AM A LOSER WHO NO ONE WANTS!"
1539,depression,My only friend the end.....,"This is my first ever reddit post and I'm not sure why I'm doing this. I've never felt this alone. I'm not sure if anyone will even see this. I sure hope someone does even if it is just one person. I'm currently 29 and I've suffered from depression since I was around the age of 18.

I've been in that dark place that many of us have but I always seem to make it out and progress. This time around I'm stuck. The world seems gray. I don' care about many things. Especially myself. I have self worth but I don't have self-love. I don't love myself enough to feel the need to continue and have given up trying to make it out this time around.

My lifestyle doesn't help me too much either. I live a very hermit like life. I've been living off Draftkings for about 2 years now. Therefore, I'm home alone 24-7 watching sports Monday-Sunday because that is my job and how I make a living. The money is great but the life isn't. I rarely talk to anyone anymore.  Shit, I'm a fucking burden to myself  the last thing I want to do is bug anyone with what I'm going through. 

When I was young I pictured a whole different life for me. You know I wanted the regular life to work a 9-5 and raise a family the whole nine. Currently, I don't see a purpose to life/ my life. Truly nothing matters to me anymore. I feel dead. My laughter is fake. My smiles are forced. My emotions don't feel real anymore. 

To me life has no true purpose. Well, I believe the purpose is to be happy but the thing is this is the hardest thing to achieve in life. Pure happiness.  When i say pure I mean constantly happy. We have things that make us happy throughout the day for brief moments. I believe those glimpses of happiness are what keeps some of us pushing. I see no glimpses of happiness lately. My thoughts are wow we are really born into this world just to work and survive. 

Life is sorry as fuck or maybe I'm just the sorry fuck. Idk I just don't care about  many things anymore. Those things that keep someone going and fighting. I don't have the will anymore. I'm complacent here in this dark place where life is gray. Where some want to go and some want to stay.  I don't think I'll be here too much longer. I've had these thoughts just never like this. I'm not asking for help this is just to spill some beans."
1540,depression,Can't believe I'm doing this but fuck it,"kinda just wanna put my thoughts out there into the void but god man. shit really blows right now I'm 20 and I feel like my life has plateaued I dropped out of every form of education I've ever had it feels impossible to get a job and my own fucking parents abandoned me. ""you're an adult now"" is what they keep saying yet why does it feel like I'm 4 again and my dad walked out the door to go fuck some Canadian lass.

I have alot to be greatful for and I am I get frequent flashes of suicidal ideation but I'd never go through with it I always figure that something better will come along y'know? like I'm alive to enjoy this life but rn it feels like I can't enjoy anything all of my passions feel like they're fizzling out and I feel like there really isn't a light at the end of this tunnel.

But the one thing keeping me going is my girlfriend. we're long distance rn which does suck but I truly think she is the love of my life and even if she isint I'm so greatful that she's in my life now I plan on seeing her for my 21st which unbenounced to her November 29th 2021 was my suicide date and I'm really glad that instead of being six feet under with a hole in my head I'll be spending it with her instead.

I know this is a place to kinda doom post and reach out for help (I promise I'm not in any danger) but I think right now I just needed to say how I'm feeling to people and kinda idk validate my existance to prove to myself that I exist and not spiral into dissasociation I understand this isint the best avenue but it's an avenue. 

if you read this thank you I really do appreciate it and I hope that you have a great day friend just incase no one else tells you today"
1541,depression,I don’t understand how to stop hating myself.,"I have had depression for a long time now. It first developed in middle school and I’m now a senior in college.

My friends are great but at the end of the day I still wish I didn’t exist. I have tried counseling and learned some good coping mechanisms so I’m not a danger to myself, but I don’t want to always feel this way.

I feel like I can't do anything right and I'm constantly unable to perform in the way I want to or succeed in the smallest way. My brain and my body are so broken and dysfunctional I don't understand how anyone could see any value in me.

Even if i was depressed and autistic, I did my best for making her happy. I did my best for not breaking this relationship. I still love her, the wounds didn't recover yet.... My heart still suffers.... With her, my depression was close to disappear.... But now it's back even worse than before. Why do girls hate having depressed bfs? I just wish i wasn't never born, i hate myself with all of myself.... It's all my fault....
Everything is getting worse for me, some days I don't even eat, some days i committed self harm (before of that thing i never did it)..... The pain is immeasurable....
Now I'm alone against the world: this unfair world, my narcissistic family, my summer irl friends (without them I'd feel more alone, i hate winter because it's the worst season)
Already tried to commit suicide 3 times but couldn't do it....
I just want to get out from all this pain and feeling happiness again, but this is an utopia....

ADVICE FOR YOU GUYS: Before starting a relationship, get depression treated and then restart your life step by step, people hate having the atmosphere ""ruined by you""....

Stay safe...."
1548,depression,classic depression symptoms,"i'm 47.  i've been posting on reddit more often because i simply cannot find relief.  i honestly can't tell if this is helping or making it worse.  i've had years of therapy and been on prescription drugs.

constant classic symptoms that i experience every day:  sadness, emptiness, hopelessness, worthlessness, loss of interest or pleasure in all normal activities, sleep disturbances, including insomnia or sleeping too much (both), tiredness and lack of energy, reduced appetite, anxiety, agitation, restlessness, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, fixating on past failures or self-blame, trouble thinking, concentrating, making decisions and remembering things, and suicidal thoughts.

the above was simply a copy/paste of pretty much everything that embodies depression.

is this it?  really?  i'm not even functioning anymore.

fuck my life, seriously.  absolutely nothing seems to be okay.  i'm not okay."
1549,depression,Just a vent and a story,"First of all, sorry for the grammar, english it's not my main language.
I just wanted to say something bad that I've done, but i'm too afraid to tell anyone that i have a good relationship.
Two days ago I was suffering too much all day, but in the night I was totally breaking down, so I thought that drinking would solve my problem (I almost do not drink at all), and there you go, I have drunk some of it and it really worked, I was calm after all, then I got back to my bad and started watching some tv until like 3:00am, but at this time I started feeling so much angry about everything that was happening in my life, and I gone to the kitchen and started trying cutting myself(I already done that in the past, but I never done fully) and I just couldn't stop, it was like the right thing that I needed to do, for like, punishing myself, I don't know. 
And that's it, I'm now with a cut in my wrist, and more scared that at some point I will probably kill myself, I already tried therapy, and now I'm taking some pills, but nothing seems to work..."
1550,depression,Am i a bad person if a little bit jealous of my brother?,"My brother is very depressed right now, doesn't leave his room, doesn't eat, doesn't talk or answer to anyone. Don't get me wrong i very much try everyday to talk to him in hopes him gets better. The thing is that everyone is worry about him and wants to help him and want to get him medical help. Which i obviously suggested. What bothers me is that a few years ago my parents and my brother found out i SH. My dad never addressed  to me and never made sure I got better or anything. My brother and my mom both suggested, not at the same moment, that i was just copying my friends ans probably just did it because i wanted to be "" cool"". That day was the worst day of my life and I still cry everytime I remember that day. They never took it seriously and I never stopped cutting until 2 years ago, except from 2 relapse i had this year. Which obviously then don't know.  But still all the work i did all alone because no one who gave a shit about me. This past week I felt seriously sad because they show so much care and worry for my brother,  but they they not once made sure I was okay in these years. And I feel that from this moment I can't never say a thing because they will acuse me of wanting 'attention' again. I obviously hope the best for my brother and want him to get better. And i don't if now is the time for me to feel this jealous because how bad he is. Do you guys think that maybe they are right and i just want attention?"
1551,depression,"I just learned that unemployment is stopping my payments due to me working one single week at a job and then getting let go. I'm completely fucked now and this is the last straw for me, mentally. I think I'm finally ""done""","I had covid last year and ended up with permanent lung damage so I've been out of work for white a while trying to find something that isn't manual labor. 

I found a job in mid July that I thought fit the bill, but they ended up lying to me about the nature of the position and it turned out to be immense physical labor. My performance was poor so they let me go after 7 days. I went to certify for unemployment at midnight a little while ago like normal and it said that since there was a break in my certifications due to me working, they need me to resubmit everything all over again including the info from my new job. And it said it would take weeks to begin payments again.

I'm already skipping meals trying to save up for my upcoming move at the end of August (to a cheaper shittier place to try and save more money) but now that doesn't seem like it's possible. 


I'm just done, mentally. I can't handle it anymore. 15 months of agony, sacrifice, and overwhelming anxiety all the time about trying to just *survive* and now THIS happens? 

I have everything I need to planned out. I'll try calling the unemployment office on Monday as a last ditch effort to try and get this rectified but I am not optimistic about my chances. I know my fiancee would be better off without me holding her back with my poor health and bad luck. I just hope she isn't hurting for too terribly long and finds a way to move in swiftly."
1552,depression,I just don’t click with anyone my age anymore...,"I’m 27. I haven’t made a friend in years, there’s potential for the friendship then I get ghosted. Which is fine, I guess we weren’t right together. That’s not the issue right now. It’s the fact that everyone I talk to, I just don’t feel anything anymore and/or they think the same about me. I’m not picky with who I talk to, it’s just impossible to meet someone who would stay through my goods and my bads. 

Right now, at this very moment, I have 1 friend who I talk to at least twice a week or so. We don’t really hang out, but we check on each other and feels genuine. 

Idk, I just feel like no one my age has a similar life style or wants to hang out with me knowing my own life style."
1553,depression,i don’t want to live or die,"i don’t want to live anymore and i’m terrified of dying. i don’t know what to do. i feel so stuck and hopeless and my brain is just convinced that absolutely nothing will make me feel any better. nothing makes me happy. i don’t love doing anything anymore. i don’t remember the last time i felt genuine happiness. i want to go into a coma for a really, really long time. still alive, but not conscious. for years. i’m so sick of being alive right now. i don’t wanna live. i really don’t wanna live. i hate myself so much. the biggest thing holding me back is not knowing what comes after death. i hate being agnostic. that’s the main thing holding me back right now. i feel like i’m gonna be unhappy forever. i feel like i will never find i reason to wake up. to get out of bed. to fucking live. i have nothing. nothing brings me joy. i don’t want to do anything. i can’t make myself happy because i don’t know what makes me happy anymore. i’m so tired of thinking, of trying to figure it out. i’m so tired. i’m physically exhausted. it’s my fault for not getting enough sleep or sleeping too much or fucking up my sleep schedule or not eating right. it’s literally all me. i feel exhausted yet i’m not even trying hard enough. i don’t want to try anymore. i feel like shit. i feel like no matter what i do i will never be happy. i feel like no one can ever truly love me besides my family. the only reason they love me is because i’m related to them. i’m worthless. i don’t want to live. i don’t want to fucking live. i can’t see a future for myself. why do i feel like this? nothing even happened. something is wrong with me. i’ve been through so much worse. i’ve never felt like this before. i think this is the lowest i’ve ever felt. for no fucking reason. there’s people out there who have it worse. so much worse. so what the fuck is wrong with me. why can’t i just appreciate what i have. i’m so fucked. if i can’t be happy right now what will i do once i move out? what will i do once i have to start paying for everything on my own? being on my own? supporting myself? having to find a job? i’m so fucking worried for the future. everything will get worse and i’ll feel even worse and i can’t even imagine what that would feel like. if it’s worse than this i truly don’t think i have what it takes to live anymore. i truly believe if it gets any worse i’ll seriously harm myself. i’m so scared of that happening. i feel so unstable right now. both physically and mentally. i’m so fucked. i’m so fucking fucked."
1554,depression,I don't know what to do...,"So I am an Indian 16M getting fucked by evrything in life, our education system is fucked

I am in 11th grade, my school fucks me, my coaching institute fucks me
And above all this my parents fuck me, they never support me for any of my decisions and never ever speak from my side (if somebody scolds me they too get in their side, not mine)

I sometimes feel like suicidal but the only thing holding me is, I think about my younger brother,

I just wanna become a 3d artist but they never support me, they think I should become engineer and fuck my life

The 2nd thing stopping me from sucide is that I sometimes get cheered up when I get to play online with my friends on Wednesday, for like 2 hrs becoz my parents go to doctor for checkup.

Once my father saw me playing with my friends, he snatched from me my phone and pc both for 1 week

The only motto of my father is, if I want to become successful in life I should study for 30 hrs in 1 day

My subjects for 11th grade are PCM(physics, chemistry and maths), I get the baddest grades in everything 

Was gonna fail in 10th grade, got passed due to Corona and exam cancelation (don't judge me by this please) 

And they all fuck me too,
I have had so many dreams, all crushed by my parents

And I can't even go to therapist cause my parents are so strict that I can't even go out of house aur talk to anybody after 4pm(and they don't even give pocket money, so I am poor too, my parents aren't ) 

Cant even leave and run away cause I have no where to go


I don't know what to do

All I wanna do is just get relaxed and do whatever, whenever I want


And the biggest fuck that happen today is that, I have a ptm (parent teacher meet) today at 1pm but I accidentally lost the zoom credentials for meeting and now the coaching institute isn't picking up my calls

Everyone hates me, it's just they don't tell me about this

And these motherfucking coaching institute give a test every fucking Sunday, I got one nest sunday on 8th August, I am gonna study till 8yh and decide about my life at same time

Thanks for reading this large piece of my shitty life, very much appreciate you

And this is only a part of my feelings, if I made a post about my whole life it would be larger then 2 harry potter books combined together"
1555,depression,15 Inspiring Quotes to Help You Grow Emotionally,[removed]
1556,depression,"Depression in the form of an ""auto-voice""","I have struggled with severe depression and anxiety since I was 9 years old. Only in the last two years have I addressed it with a combination of medication, therapy, and sobriety from alcohol. I'm 39, married, father of three.

2 years ago I hit rock bottom. Fell into the abyss and almost didn't climb out. I thought I had suppressed the auto-voice that is in my head telling me how horrible and worthless I am, after climbing out of the hole. But recently the voice has returned.

Does anyone else have this voice? I try reframing but it's not working anymore.

I feel myself descending again.

Its excruciatingly lonely. Maddening. I just want to hear some voices other than the auto-voice."
1557,depression,I’m so stupid,"I push people away and then the next thing I know, I feel like seeking out for new friendships like ughhh wtf is wrong with me 😪"
1558,depression,I'm sick of crying..,This past week all I have done was reorganizing the house or started nut run off to the bathroom so my babies don't see me crying again.. im just soo hurt.. I just wanna feel loved and wanted .. im trying to be strong for my family but I don't know..
1559,depression,Depression from illness must be the worst depression,"I suffer from mild depression, but I have my dark days and today was one of them. Except today I woke up ill and incredibly dizzy. The room was spinning and I couldn’t sleep it away. I had to stay awake. Made me think. Depression caused by illness must be the worst type of depression. I can handle depression from heartbreak, possibly even bereavement even though it would be hard. But to be depressed and ill I am certain I would look to end my life and that upsets me.

I thought I was stronger than that."

1564,depression,My life is ::good:: but I'm depressed as fuck - sometimes people call me negative and I think it's really unfair. I wouldn't choose to be miserable all the time.,"I just find everything to be so empty - and I am too apathetic and depressed even to do the things I used to love.

I'm not looking for pity or trying to play the victim, I take accountability for my own life.

But I barely have the energy to get through the day most days. It sucks and I feel so sorry for my husband.

I can't find the joy and beauty in the simple things anymore, I used to love looking at trees and flowers and just be in awe - not everything just looks blah - I feel everything is in a haze.

I just feel like life is meaningless and there is no reason to continue.

There is nothing :wrong: in my life, and I don't have a :reason: to be depressed - but I just am.

People tell me just live in gratitude and be grateful and in truth I am, I know we are lucky to have a home, and jobs, and food, and vehicles.

People always say ""at least you have your health"" - but. The truth is I don't. Depression makes everyday feel like an absolute struggle and I just can't wait to be home in bed (of course I'm lucky to have a bed)

I just don't know what the fuck is wrong with me.

I'm actually starting to think about seeing an endocrinologist because I'm wondering if it's depression or maybe something else, like hormones, thyroid, or adrenal fatigue or something."

I told my boyfriend of nearly 5 years that I’m thinking about running away and eloping. I’m 25 and somehow my mind has never developed past teenage years. I still feel like a teen.

1571,depression,What’s that feeling called? And why do I feel so affected?,"I didn’t know where to ask because I’m not sure if anyone has felt this way but what’s that feeling where you look at a spot where there was a good time with friends, family etc but when they all leave, the silence is oddly loud and you’re just left alone when awhile ago you were having a good time. It just hits me hard when I see empty spots my friends and family sat in and I’m just by myself."
1572,depression,I just want to rant for a bit about my life.,"So I got a new job early June because my old workplace was getting really toxic even though I loved it but I just knew it was time for me to go for certain reasons I won't get into. This new job i got is kind of similar to Trader Joe's, and I thought it was a start of a new journey and it's a fresh breath of air. I get paid a lot more, I am given a lot more hours, and there are bonuses that come with the job as well. 
 The excitement didn't really last long. I'm not treated very well there. I try to do my best and excellency with everything but a few coworkers of mine including a manager start to belittle me and treat me like I'm dumb and like I'm a five year old. 
They aren't nice at all. It's not like I am rude or treat them negatively, I actually go to work with my very best and I try to be nice and kind to everyone. When I ask questions, I have been told that ""I need to think"" and ""that I need to use my brain"" and that ""I'm clearly not trained properly"" when there's something I don't understand. And when I try to reach to manager about it I'm told that those people that said those to me are just like that and I need to not let it get to me. 
But it is getting to me. I'm just more than a month in and I've cried so much at work, and dreaded going in, and overall this workplace has made me go back to a really bad depressive episode. I'm in a position too where I can't leave yet and I have to suck it up and wait, so right now there's nothing I can really do but hold on tight and tell myself that this will only be temporary. But it's getting seriously hard to go on. I want to move out but I can't yet. I feel really trapped and I can't breath. It seems like I'm the only employee too that gets treated like this. 
 That's all for my rant. Thank you for listening."
1573,depression,I just want everything to be over,"I'm a 20 year old guy, I've been dealing with depression for a couple years now, but as of the last few months it's just gotten worse and worse. I'm too tired to go into the full story, but in short, I dropped out of school, lost 2 jobs, my parents have given up on me and think I'm useless, and my girlfriend of 1 year recently left me, which still hurts the most out of everything.


I've been talking to therapists and taking medication, but nothing helps. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I can't distract myself with anything to make me happy. Things I used to love, video games, music, now it's just nothing. 

I'm just so overwhelmed right now by everything. I have barely gotten out of bed in the last month. Out of all the problems and shit I have going on, the most I can think of is my now ex-girlfriend. I miss her so much and it's killing me.

I used to think I could be something different in life, but now I'm just ready for it to be over. The reasons to hold on are slowly fading away. I don't want to kill myself, I just want everything to be over with. I forgot what it's like to go to bed and wake up happy."

1581,depression,i don’t feel the the rays of sunshine anymore,"im having the worst day,
maybe even going thru the worst part of life rn 

every day i wake up and i know i failed everyone and am failing myself but some how i can’t manage to get my shit together to save myself. i have a PhD but im dumb as a rock and didn’t even pull the thousand out of the air to take my board exams. I do good on studying for a week or two and then it goes down the drain and I lose my track and I have to start over. I’m swimming in debt from student loans, and when I’m home I’m either getting shamed for not spending every minute studying (when I don’t even think I can do quality studying in my room) or being pressured to care for my family and provide hot meals daily since I’m so available as I’m also not working. One minute it’s when r u going to take ur test, and the next it’s good thing you’re not working bc ur granny needs you (in the months since ive graduate she’s had a pace maker removed and then went back in after recovering for a hip replacement). at one point I questioned if god was delaying my progress for a year so I could help everyone else, but not truly help myself.

the icing on the cake was maybe being in splitsville after arguing w my emotionally abusive bf today and on the drive home my car started shaking and flashing engine lights. so now i have that burden to add to my never ending list of emotional and then also very very real problems. I don’t know if we’ll be on bad terms for too long as my bday is Tuesday, but I’m also kind of dreading that day bc my family will want to go out to eat to be nice to me and money is so tight. I told myself if I ever ran into good money and could work and be stable, I would make a promise w god that I would be the one to pay for my bday dinner and host it myself so no one has to worry and I would bear that for everyone so they can at least get some kind of joy out of coming out to celebrate me. but what’s there to even celebrate about me, no one is proud of me as I’m a year delayed in my career, but I guess they like me as a person since we’re all family.

honestly, i don’t even think i was meant to live long. part of me has always thought i had too many problems to live for much longer. I wonder if I’ll be able to live one day and not have a dark cloud over me.

i thought maybe I could get a part time and save to kind of uplift myself, maybe I could get my studying in tack but it’s been a year and I’m deep in the hole i dug for myself. I don’t know how I’ll get around now and I don’t want to be a burden on anyone.

how can I pick myself up from this"

1583,depression,Suicidal,It’s so close to my moms anniversary of 3 years in November and I’ve been feeling like I have nobody anymore I’m so young at 24 I’m having my suicidal thoughts all over again which I haven’t had in 3 years but for some reason it hit me the worst this year .. I just don’t know what to do anymore …💔😣
1584,depression,It isn't worth fighting it,"So for some context. I'm a trans woman (19) and I can be ok ish passable. Most the time I can pass fine. But off I have dysphoria, I've been molested a lot as a kid, physically abused, almost raped, ect ect. While I have a great family. I deal heavily with bi polar, and depression mixed with ADHD. Sometimes I feel like things are on top of the world and that I can do anything. But them... A lot or most the times I get like this. Where my emotional downs are so deep that my chest physical hurts. That I can go even months without showering (covid and stuck at home so it's easy to forget). Or even just feed myself good food. I've been stuck here in a place where there's nothing but proud boys and other far right groups who would love to get the chance to hurt me. I was supposed to be in cali last year but covid happened. I'm going there in the fall but tbh. Knowing I'll live life like this? It's not worth it. I hate that everyday it feels as if I'm hanging on to this piece of wood drifting in the middle of an ocean. And sometimes storms come and try to drown me. It's a constant state of fighting to just survive. I mean when it gets to the point where you wanting to pee is considered a political statement. And that people want to call you a pedophile for just wanting to pee ... What's the point? I mean I'm always going to fight for my life so why even try? My chest hurts so much it legit feels as if my heart is gone and I feel such a deep pain I can't do anything. I want to end it all but for some reason my instinctual need to live is preventing me. But I can't stop thinking about how nice it would be to just end it all. I have no friends irl. I'm my current situation I'm forced to wait to move before I can make friends irl. With all this past traumatic experiences and ptsd I choose terrible friends who further contribute to my depression. I have no love for myself. I fall in love with anyone. It's so bad I miss the fact when I was a kid at least older men would want my attention. Nothing is worth it anymore. I have pages and pages of suicide notes because it helps the pain but I have a full notebooks worth already. I can't do this. Why should I do this? Because some select group of people will miss me? Because my dog will be heart broken? Idk if that's enough anymore. I'll never be a ""woman"" in my eyes. And even with a bit over a decade of therapy my ptsd isn't gone. My trauma still heavily affects me. Idk what to do. I want to fix it but genuinely I've done everything. I want love anything. I want to do anything other then what I am now. I dream of waking up as a cis woman. I've begged and begged whatever and whoever might listen (I'm an atheist but at this point I'll beg any god or gods at night just so I can cry). To just be given the opportunity to be a woman. I just want a restart. My life was doomed from the start. I have so much hate for this world. And while I'm a huge humanitarian and could never be pushed to a mass shooter level. I just have the hate that makes my entire body shake. That in my mind I can't wait for all these fucks to die. But then I realize that they'll always be terrible people and I'll always be the freak. I won't ever have redemption. They'll never be justice or even revenge. I'll never be equal to anyone. I'm only writing this here because I broke my only pencil writing my last note which is fucking 4 pages long. This is a cry for help. Which ultimately won't mean shit. Because it's not like some internet strangers can genuinely offer any advice on how to magically fix all my issues so I can finally try a normal life. But at least I can cry it out here so I can finally get so tired I pass out. Then rinse and repeat for a month or however my depression last."
1585,depression,I feel like I’m faking it,"I always feel like I’m faking it and doing it for attention
Like I talk to a friend about my problems, or post about it and I feel like I’m faking it because my brain says “oh tell them this and blah blah you’ll get actually attention for once” or something, or sometimes I am still happy about stuff or enjoy things or I feel like nothings fun anymore and that’s probably just me being Lazy.
I don’t have it as bad as other people so I just feel like I’m faking it all the time because why else would I be sad about everything going on? It’s hard to describe but it just feels like everything i’m doing is for attention and I don’t know what to do about it.
Everyone says that if I’m worried about this I’m probably not a attention whore, or maybe I do want attention but in a “I need help please” way but I don’t know that doesn’t makes me feel better.
I’m really sorry if this is a dumb post."
1586,depression,Ready to just swallow my pain away,Idk who’s gonna see this right now I’m staring at a bottle of sleeping pills and I’m drunk on whiskey trying to see if I can take them and not wake up…my life has been hell I was in the army and got out because of multiple injuries. One of the Injuries I have is a tumor inside my bones and it’s insanely hard to just walk sometimes…Its literally like having a needle inside you’re foot all day…I come from an extremely broken home growing up my mom never loved me never cared so I have barley a soul to show..motherless children barley have souls and I’m included 😞 that and my current relationship with who I think is the LOML the only person who can save me from the pain I’ve suffered and on top of that I feel I’m annoying and just hard to be around…I hate myself and I always will I just wanna end it and enjoy no pain ever again just nothingness the most peace I’ll ever have 😞 I’m not here for attention just a final chance at life rn I feel more alone than ever and honestly just want it all to end I’m currently just sitting here staring at these pills wondering if I should even bother continuing on in life.

1590,depression,Does therapy actually help?,"Does therapy actually help. What is paying someone to pretend to be a crappy friend going to do? From what I've heard they barely give advice and just simply listen to you. I can listen to myself for free, so why pay for a therapist? I know how to self analyze, so why do I need them?"
1591,depression,I’m terrified of getting off meds.,"This is more of just word vomit but any personal experiences appreciated if you want to share.. I’ve been on Bupropion for 3(?) years now. Therapists have figured that school is what causes me so much stress and depression. I just graduated uni, so in theory it’s time to get off meds. 

I’m so scared though. I don’t think I’m ready even though my number one stressor is gone. Part of me wants to be all better and be fixed and get off them but part of me doesn’t want to stop my safety net. I don’t want to be on them forever but I feel like they help no matter if I’m in school or not. I’m just so terrified"
1592,depression,27 years old and it feels like I’m getting nowhere in life,"I’ve been in the same spot for almost 10 years now... single/no friends/unemployed/doesn’t drive/does nothing to better myself for the potential future that I might have. Honestly I can’t see myself with a future, but hey one can always hope. There’s no hint of change anytime soon anywhere. I’m constantly on my own, everything I need to improve on I need to do on my own. And that’s seriously demotivating to the point where I don’t even want to try anymore. 

I’m just so tired of doing the same unproductive things everyday. I want to get better, but I don’t want to be alone doing so."

1595,depression,My mom died a year ago and I feel so alone,"My mom died suddenly a year ago from cancer. This past year has been so hard. I miss her so much. She was the one person who I could talk to about anything. We lived a thousand miles away from each other, but she would answer the phone no matter what time it was. She always had time to get me through my anxiety attacks. I feel like others think I'm crazy when I fall into a panic, and she was the only one who knew how bad they really get because she got them too. She never judged me. We got each other through. Now that she's gone I realize that I have almost no friends and the ones I do have I can't talk to about what I feel inside because I'm afraid they will think I'm really loosing it. 

This past year I've fallen into a deep dark depression. The grief comes and goes. The anxiety is worse than ever.  The panic and paranoia are so real. And I realize I have no one to talk to about it. My husband of 8 years does his best to help me, but my internal struggles have really worn us down. Sometimes I'm so depressed that I can't feel anything. I can tell he's frustrated with me, but I have no idea how to move on with my life. I still go to work and carry on as best I can at home. But I feel so alone. 

How do I move on?"

1598,depression,I’ve been suicidal since I was 14 and it’s gotten worse,"
I’ve been suicidal since I was 14 (I’m 16 now) I pretty much think about it everyday. I just feel like my whole life is worthless and hopeless, I had a pretty shitty childhood my mum didn’t really care what I did and my dad died when I was 9. After that my mum was addicted to drugs so she could barely take care of me. I have a disabled brother so he’s basically the focus of everything I never get any attention from my mum. I don’t remember the last time she said she loves me or hugged her, I just wish I had someone who actually loved me. I’ve lost all of my friends because apparently I’m a dick but I don’t know how suppose I just try to push everyone away. I don’t know how I’m supposed to get anywhere with life I haven’t been to school since 14 too, my mum stopped me from going around the time I started having suicidal thoughts I guess that was the ignition of it. Now all she does is lay down all day and do nothing sometimes I have to go days without eating. I’m just so sick of this, everyone i tell never takes me seriously. I wish someone would help me I feel so hopeless and lost at this point it feels like suicide is the only option. My “best friend” he even says to me he thinks I’m never gonna have a job or succeed to anything in life so realistically what’s even the point in trying if the one person I trust even believes my worst fear. It’s clear no one cares as much as they say they do it’s just so fucking clear it’s deception. I’m so fucking done with this."
1599,depression,Rehab made me worse,"I lost my job and am on academic dismissal because I was completely cut off from the world for two months. I don’t have the energy to fix the mess that I made of my life by seeking professional help. I don’t know if I ever will. Around Sept-Dec of last year I thought I’d finally found the will to live.. and then it was just gone. I started wasting away. So I went to treatment, but now I’m scaring my family with how low I’ve been functioning since coming home. Overwhelmed with guilt for how much money, time, and hard work I’ve lost by going into treatment. I wanted to get better, I did everything they told me to. I meditated and worked out every day, communed with nature, got real in therapy, changed my meds—everything. And I’m worse. But buff! But worse. I can’t imagine living out the remainder of my life like this. I feel more stupid and unpleasant to be around than I ever have. I can’t take care of my friends, family, and girlfriend they way they deserve to be cared for. I don’t know what to do when I can barely muster the strength to wake up."
1600,depression,Old memories just came back,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to post this but I was just doing my work, trying to finish up some projects and I was looking through my pictures for something. I came across few old things I had saved and one of them was a picture of my ex that I forgot to delete. Suddenly memories of her came back to me hitting me like a truck, pushing me deep down into the earth. Now I don’t feel like doing my projects or anything. I just wanna lay in bed and cry until morning.. We broke up in January and last we spoke was in March. After looking at her picture, I really want her to come back but I know that’s childish and impossible. No one probably cares but it seriously hurts and it has been hurting for the past 6 months.."
1601,depression,I wish I was never born,"Everyone hates me. Nobody wants to talk with me. No matter how hard I try I'm just a big failure for everyone.

They don't even know if I exist or not, or am I dead or alive, then what's the point of me being alive?. TBH I'm tired to stay here in this world. Everything has its limit. But my pain and depression has become limitless. Every single day I'm suffering.  But how long it will last? Wish I was never born 😞"
1602,depression,Question: How do i make friends when everybody hates me?,"Im 16F and I feel like I'm drowning in loneliness. Something bad happened to me, something traumatic. And once people from my school found out, they took it as a public service to ruin my life further and trigger trumatic episodes for me. Why? Because they think i'm lying. I wish they realized the pain and suffering they're causing me, purely because of their selfish needs to get involved and pick sides without hearing my own. Innocence is bliss huh. The situation isn't a light one either, and I'm getting told that it'll just go away, people will forget. I know they wont, they're going to linger for the rest of my schooling years. I'm considering dropping out, although it's been a dream of mine to get into University for years. I just don't know what to do. I don't want this situation to get the better of me, to ruin my life and let them win, but I feel so weak, and I don't know if I'm strong enough. I'm spending the entirety of my two week break at home, watching youtube for hours on end, typically podcasts, it makes me feel slightly less alone. I feel like I'm going to stay this lonely for a long time, all my friends have left me because I'm the accused liar. It hurts. 

I'm getting therapy for this, and its going to take a long time for me to heal, if ever. I just feel like I should be spending my break going out with friends and doing shit, instead I'm just sitting in my own self pity. I want to know how I can make new friends or if any are you are willing to be my friend, i'm so desperate.

1614,depression,I don't know where else to turn.,"Hi everyone. I'd first like to thank you for taking the time to read this. It feels as though I've spiraled to the lowest point in my life. There's much I could say but I'll just bring up a few points.
I feel like an absolute waste of space. I've suffered loneliness and depression since middle school. When I first spoke to a counselor, she noticed some scars, so I was Baker acted at 13. My only memories of high school consist of quiet tears on the bus ride, sitting alone at lunch, and missing days because my anxiety grew unbearable. I've ruined my relationships. I possibly have BPD, but can't say for certain unless I get a professional diagnosis. I only had one or two friends growing up and I'm not entirely sure why they've stuck around. I nearly lost one of them because I felt like too much of a burden to keep in contact during a time I should have. Everyone I meet reminds me of how insufferable I am. I'm truly undesirable and unnoticeable. People forget I'm in the room. No one cares about what I have to say. When I build up the courage to speak, it's only followed by regret. I say all the wrong things and make a fool of myself if I talk and when I don't I'm too quiet/weird/boring. 
I've messed up every good thing in my life. When I try to make things better, I just end up in a worse position than before. I feel like I'm made up of poison. I'm constantly on the verge of tears. My coworkers either tolerate me or clearly dislike when I'm around. I try to stay out of their way yet I'm often yelled at or used as an emotional punching bag. I'm always under pressure to not make any mistake or they'll resent me even more. They have every right to honestly. I think everyone resents me once they get to know me. I wish I never existed. My parents deserved better than me. My partner could easily do better, the way he looks at me breaks my heart. I only see him genuinely happy and enjoying himself with anyone else. When it's just me and him, I always question why he's wasting his time. I think if he had a little more confidence, he'd realize he could have any girl he wanted. Someone he can truly bond with. Someone who will offer more than I could ever dream of. 
My heart has been aching for a long time. At the end of the day, there is nothing to love or remotely like about me. I've been terrible because of my distrust, insecurities, and anger. I detest myself. My lack of a personality combined with grotesque appearance and worthless soul. I don't know who I am anymore. I've only ever felt others' disgust towards me. That's all I've experienced to be true. I was Baker acted a second time when I relapsed and needed stitches. A few years down the line and here I am. I don't have many fun memories or can look back to a time when things were better. My sadness has weighed heavier each day for as long as I can remember. I live like a robot now. Days blend together. Work, sleep, school. Lay in bed on my days off. Cry at work, cry to sleep. I'm almost 25. I don't have a license. I've never looked forward to a weekend. I forget there's a world out there full of life and people who are always experiencing so much. I just waste away at home with no one and nowhere to go. The few times I've been to places with my partner, I just end up breaking down because I can't bear this sadness anymore. I can't escape this misery. I'm either in a state of panic with an aching pain in my chest, suffocating and nauseous from crying so much or I'm simply numb and hollow until my breaking point again. That's my life's cycle. It feels like I'm drowning and I just won't die.

Anyway, thanks again for getting this far. This post turned out longer than I anticipated. I know I didn't provide many details. I'm only comfortable with sharing as much as I did. Hope everyone has a good night."

1617,depression,What am I feeling,"Not sure where or what should I start with. But I have been feeling this feeling for weeks or not years. I need to get this out of my system. Pardon me for my imperfect english. 

I don’t feel anything anymore. Everyday is just a day just to get over with.  I have nothing to look forward anymore. I have a dead bedroom issues. Getting fucked while not feeling anything. My husband never validate my feelings. Instead he turned it on me whenever I want to talk about what’s bothering me. I feel more alone than ever. I smoke from half a pack to one pack a day. Might even progress to two packs per day .. I’m struggling with tears... to even type this cause I don’t think anyone would understand me. 

Covid situation doesn’t even help . Worst was I can just switch off my feelings and just go through the day without feeling anything and the wanting to sleep for a whole day is so appealing to me cause I don’t have to deal with what’s in my head. My meals went from 3 meals a day to 1 meal or nothing. 

I do things to get distracted or whatever to get me in another state of mind so that I’ll be occupied and not think negatively. I ride a bike and I’m just waiting for the day I get into an accident and just don’t wake up. So people won’t think that I kill myself. Just need to get this off my chest .. thank you for even reading.."

1620,depression,Climbing out of the spiral of depression,"Depression is such a loose term that tries to encapsulate the different symptoms, behaviours and mindsets of those who struggle with it. The extent to which it might be debilitating differs from person to person. The cause of it might differ as well. 

Here's my version of it. I've been experiencing depression since I was 8. Looking back at what I had gone through as a child, my experiences shaped my mindset. Unfortunately, the experiences I had as a child were filled with abandonment, rejection, disappointment and breach of trust. There were also moments of realisation that acceptance could be achieved if I tried to be someone else. The playful and mischievous kid turned into a quiet, well-behaved, socially distant and awkward teenager in the hopes that his teachers would accept him. No friend gained though. Even my major was selected on the basis of ""what major would make my parents accept me?""

Isn't it weird that the very thing that you consciously try to avoid turns you into that very same monster? I made every attempt to not be like my Dad. Guess what? I'm so much like him. I tried so hard to be someone whom others would accept only to be rejected over and over. 

It got to a stage where I just gave up. ""Why bother?"" In my opinion, those are the two most dangerous words in the world. Thus began the downward spiral into the vortex of depression. A stage of depression where you become nonchalant about anyone and everything. You gradually lose the capacity to care. That's where I am right now as a 38 year old. Of course, with this conscious conditioning, it has a biochemical effect on your body to adapt to your new way of 'being'. This was when I met 'Anhedonia'. Supposedly a symptom of depression but I'm sure others would affirm that it is a monster of a different kind.

For those who had reached this level of debilitation, how did you get out of it?"
1621,depression,Night anxiety...why?,"Why can't I just relax? Why do I suddenly go in and out of this anxiety. I can only describe it as a sudden pit in your stomach, which can turn into nervous nausea, your heart palpitating more and you're all tense. And it happens for no damn good reason!

I don't need this keeping me up tonight. I just need to feel relaxed and comfortable. It's so weird that nothing seems to trigger it either. It just...hits. Suddenly.
Then leaves. 
And then comes back.

Maybe there is a trigger, but I don't really notice it. 
Anyway, my stomach feels kind of weird, and I'm tired and want to sleep so I should try to relax. But it's so bothersome. It's tough to get my heartrate down and the feeling to pass. 

Does crying help? Or make it worse? Maybe I should listen to music...

Why does this happen...I can't be the only one..."
1622,depression,TW - I need some distraction please,I want to harm myself really bad. Like really really bad. I'm lying here in bed sweating because I know if I get up I'm going to look for something to hurt myself with. Someone help me please
1623,depression,"Take a moment, please","Take six, slow breaths.

Breathe down, expanding your lower abdomen as you inhale

Feel each one, in... and out...

Hear each one

Know that in this very moment, you are here. 

With me

Breathing

Tense all the muscles in your arms, and bring your palms together without pressing

Move them against each other, feeling the gentle friction

Close your eyes

Take five more slow, deep breaths

Stay as long as you'd like, tensing your legs, wiggle your toes.

Take a break from your thoughts

Spend a few moments with your body.

It is always here, with you"
1624,depression,Does this happen to you?,So I've noticed for a while now that I'll feel depressed for a few weeks  then I feel better for a while and then depressed again for weeks and so on. I only tell my husband about it but not everything that goes on in my head and to everyone else I just try to act normal when I'm actually sad. These last few weeks I have felt depression at my worst like I didn't  want to get up and do things but I did because I had to. I made myself get up and do workouts and have to be a mom to my kids. Does this happen to any of you?
1625,depression,Existential crisis,I just went a solid 5 days without wanting to kill myself for the first time in a while. I don't think the state I'm in is classified as happiness though. In fact I don't think I have felt true happiness ever. Well happiness over an extended period of time I should say. Every somewhat high point is almost immediately ruined and its to the point that I get suspicious if everything goes good for a while. This then led to the realization that nothing I do truly matters and has never truly mattered. Does it stop the emotional turmoil I feel daily? Not really. Will it stop me from contributing to society so that my needs get met? Not really. Here I am realizing that nothing I do matters yet still I'm still doing it and still feeling shitty doing it. Huzzah!

Today is particularly bad. 
I pick up one thing, in an attempt to clean, then I want to lie down.
I have anxiety about the stupidest things. Today  it’s: “why are so many people moving out this month?”, “is there something wrong with the building?” “Are they increasing the rent too much?” “What if…”. It’s  also my ex’s birthday, it’ll be the first year we’re not celebrating together after 6 years.

1628,depression,Leaving The Sub,"This place, while I respect every one of you who has come here to talk about your feelings of dread, self doubt, self hatred, bitterness, existentialism, lack of purpose, or any other thought pattern influenced by depression, I can safely say that this place is an echo chamber of darkness. It's not healthy for me to see people struggling so much, and all i can do is offer words of encouragement. I want to do more but at the end of the day, there isn't really much I can do. As a person struggling with this terrible affliction on a day to day basis, I don't want to be reminded that there's someone else suffering just as much as me, cause then that makes me question why we have to suffer at all, and that never leads me to a happy place.

We both want to go our separate ways, to find our purpose in life. But he told me he was scared to, because he was scared *for me*. 

and it makes me feel like shit, BECAUSE HE'S RIGHT TO BE WORRIED ABOUT ME.   
I have never wanted to live for as long as I have. I seriously have never seen my graduation until the day it happened. NOw I worry that I'll never see success until the day it happens. WHich sounds pretty fuckin miserable to me. 

Recently, a sudden upbringing of urges have emerged. 

it. has. been. KILLING. ME. 

All I'm thinking about right now are the chances I have at acquiring a good blade to use on my skin. It's all I've thought about for weeks now, and I use marijuana wax to numb the urges away.   


Okay, I'm finished with my rant. 

All realness, I'm really looking forward to being alone. Now that I'm an adult, I have many possibilities(after I require my important documents). Most of the things I'm looking forward to, are the many opportunities I'll get at making some new friends, on my own. 

With my new levels of self-things(esteem, worth, confidence, etc.), I'm feeling sure that I'll have a better perspective when out in society. I feel like a butterfly emerging from a cocoon. 

I'm still a little scared of what is about to come. The fact that there are too many possibilities, keeps me on my tippy toes.

1639,depression,Depression and lack of an identity,"I’m in my twenties and feel that for a long time I haven’t had much of an “identity” to call my own. much of the advice centered around overcoming depression involves things like finding a hobby, interests, etc, basically just filling your life up with people and activities, but whenever I try to get into new things or new hobbies, I find that there’s nothing i really enjoy enough for it to “stick”. I used to be the popular girl in high school and thought i made a lot of friends in college, but now I don’t really have many close friends at all, and also no real way of reaching out and making friends because there’s nothing significant in who I am that I could leverage in fostering friendships. I don’t have any hobbies or interests I enjoy enough, and the only part of my personality that’s consistent is that I’m depressed and overly sensitive. When it comes to interacting with others, I often feel as if I mold my identity to fit theirs, but it’s not really something that’s “mine”. I can’t list fun facts about myself, because there’s nothing there. I don’t have goals or a vision. I struggle to describe who I am as a person, because I don’t know who i really am, and feel as if there’s nothing significant that makes up me / my identity the way it is for others. It’s been this way for awhile now, so I don’t really know if it’s my depression or if the person i am is just someone who isn’t really anyone at all... Has anyone else ever felt this way?"

I’ve been through some things that are truly horrid, like rape, sexual/mental abuse, bullied, emotional abuse, gaslighting, manipulation. It’s been a lot. I know I can move past it all even though it’s just really hard right now.

My question to you, parents, is, how did you or do you plan to tell your children about these types of things? How do you explain self harm to a kid? How do you inform them so they don’t make the same mistakes that you did? When did you choose to tell them and if you chose not to, why so? I guess I just have no idea how someone would handle this so I’m curious if anyone has any insight on this sort of thing.

1654,depression,I don’t want to live in a world where people are too stupid to get vaccinated or wear a mask.,"Don’t worry, I’m not suicidal. 

The title says it all. I just can’t take it any more. 

We have enough dangers as society that we all try to prevent. And sure, there are reckless and bad people out there. 

But I can’t take this Covid idiocy any more. I used to love restaurants. I haven’t been in a restaurant for over a year, because masks are unappetizing to me. I simply wouldn’t enjoy it. 

I haven’t taken a vacation because the things I like to do are social. (Like enjoying restaurants.) please don’t recommend a deserted beach, or a quiet trail in the forest. It’s not what I want. 

Worst of all, I’ve watched so many people die unnecessarily. People close to me. Casual acquaintances. Friends of friends. 

And, Covid is just the dress rehearsal. The Delta variant is just a tease of the real risk…a future disease that is more transmissible, and more deadly. 

The antidote? Brain cells. Just a small amount of brain cells. You don’t need a lot. Yet, apparently, too many humans don’t have enough. 

If we were all doing our best, that would be one thing. But to have approximately a third of all people consciously thwarting the most common sense measures to keep us safe? It’s maddening. 

It’s making me crazy. It’s causing constant anxiety. I can’t do the things I enjoy the most. And don’t even try to tell me that I’m overreacting to the future threat of a worse virus, as one is most certainly inevitable. 

I don’t want to live on a planet with a bunch of idiots like this. I don’t feel safe, and I don’t want to do anything any more. 

I hate it."

I'm steadily declining and I can see myself being like that soon. I never leave my house anymore except when my parents force me to. Today they made me go to my sister's softball game and I just kept asking to sit in the car. Everything is just so boring but at the same time I feel content just staring into space and sleeping when I'm not even tired. I don't really know why I make these posts. There's not much advice you guys can give me and even if you do give me some I doubt I would actually take it. I'm just so lazy."
1656,depression,I've been alone for so long that I can't handle friends anymore.,"I just left my 2 good friends. Because they were too good for me. They always had my back but I feel like I don't deserve it. I've been pretty much alone for 18 years no friends only family. There has to be a reason for that which is probably that I'm just a fucking waste of space. They're like ""If you won't go then I won't go either"" and I feel like I'm just ruining their fun. I just want them to be happy. I can't handle suddenly being an amazing guy. It just makes me confused and anxious. I would love to spend time with them but I feel like I'm just a burden for them. They don't need me in their lives they'll find someone else. I'm just so used to being the guy in the background that nobody notices or if they do notice they usually just think I'm a big fucking retard. Which is probably true.

Things are actually going pretty great in my life, which I should be happy and enjoying this time. Some days I’m fine, but nights like these, I can’t escape the thought of how much easier everything would be if I wasn’t here. I know it doesn’t make others life’s around me easier. Maybe I’m being selfish? Is it cause I hate myself? 

I have never thought of coming here before and reading other people’s posts make me sad. They also really helps me realize I’m not alone.

A big topic fueling me is my friends. Or lack of. I haven’t talked to anyone since school ended except for one person (who I consider to be probably my closest friend) but I know that I don’t matter near as much to them as they do to me, and honestly this can apply to a lot of them. I don’t know if it’s just me, I don’t start conversations, but I’ll see them talking to so many people. It’s like they just forget about me, or just don’t make the time. Even when I do try and reach out or ask them if they want to do something they’ll tell me they’re busy, and that’s fine, but then I’ll see they’ve posted 20 other things with everybody they hang out with everywhere else. Or even my other friends sometimes hang out with each other and don’t ever include me.

Every time I see one of my friends I just give up more. It immediately puts me into a state of shame and guilt, and I just start to constantly question my personality and if I’m just a bad friend? Maybe I’ll ask one of them, but at this rate it’d probably do more good to off myself lmao"

Broken

I despise reality

Its all I can see

Most people dream

Or have dreams

I just see reality

I can see my wife

I can see my kids

I cannot see my happiness

I cannot burden them with my disability

I will not see my wife

I will not see my kids

They do not exist

They will not exist

I will not let them exist

One day that might be close or far

The sadness of the world will complete its ritual on my being

It is inevitable 

This is reality

They say if you commit fully you will attain your dreams

I agree

But I will never do that

I find sadness wherever I look

I feel alone all the time

I see imperfections in every aspect of my being

I know fully that I could attain my dreams

But I know I won’t commit

I see reality

I despise reality"

I don't want to lose him.

I'm so tired of being alone, I don't want to lose anyone else."
1665,depression,I couldn't even kill myself properly..,"I got scared. I got scared of all the things I would be missing out. There's still so much I wanted to do, all my life I've tried so hard to do something with my life. No matter how hard I try, it's never enough, I can't even hold the fruits of my labour and appreciate its beauty. How many more times will I be given a glimpse of everything I desire, everything I possibly can't have, a glimmer of how better life could be, and then snatched away before I can get close. I see all the opportunities I can never have, the person I can never be, because of the country I'm born in and the colour of my skin. I'm tired, so tired. I'm at a point way beyond my limit, how many more breakdowns, how many more broken pieces, how many more scars, how many more panic attacks, how much longer should I stare at the void. My whole life has been this way ever since I can remember. I can't go on much longer... But apparently even in my last moments, I fail to do it right, I let myself get help and get admitted in the hospital to pump out all the drugs. Why did I still hope that life could be better when I've only known otherwise?

It's bad enough that my mind betrayed me (whichever choice you choose to be the betrayal feel free to decide), I have to constantly answer everyone's questions of why and listen to their judgements, scoldings and condemnation. I even have to explain to the police why I did it. I DON'T KNOW WHY I DID IT, MAYBE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE ANYMORE, IF I KNEW EXACTLY WHY I CAN'T FIND THE STRENGTH TO LIVE, THEN I WOULDN'T BE HERE LISTENING TO YOUR BS!!! 
These people hardly know me or my life and my experiences, what gives them the right to condemn me. One of the nurses who was doing the procedure on me, said that he would beat me, yes BEAT ME, if I tried to do it again!!! I don't need anyone's sympathy but for goodness sake please be a bit more understanding and shut it with your questions, what good does it do for you knowing why I took this decision, a good source of gossip maybe? I already see you looking at me, pointing at me and whispering. I'm still stuck at the hospital, but all I do is, want to go home. They won't let me go home, it's been more than a day, they said I had to stay overnight for observation, physically I'm all good, they won't even tell me anything with all this poking and prodding, please just let me go home, don't torture me further than my mind already does."
1666,depression,I “overdosed” and blamed it on my doctor who gave me the prescription,"I took too many pills and was bleeding in the ER for 2 hours straight. 

I took three different drugs, one, being a blood thinner… The entire experience was so uncomfortable, I was bleeding from inside my mouth so I couldn’t speak and at one point I started choking on my own blood. 


Instead of owning up to what I did to myself, I decided to just lie and say it’s what I was prescribed for a minor surgery I got. 

I posted on snapchat about being in the hospital, I don’t exactly know why I did— I set up myself for humiliation cuz now I’m now dubbed “the girl who tried to kill herself.” It pisses me the fuck off because I didn’t even tell anyone about kms, they just assume so bc they know Im depressed. It hurts cuz it’s true. 

Whenever people ask abt it (which is rare) I just blame my doctor. 

Why is it that we must push people over the edge to care? 

People, or the people that I know, don’t care about attempts, only the suicides."
1667,depression,"[Progress]It’s taken a long time, but I’m finally starting to like the person I am.","I’ve been depressed since the age of 11. Admitted to multiple mental hospitals, several therapists, 2 wilderness therapy trips, and almost a decade wasted on RuneScape. Around 6 months ago I decided I wanted to stop spending all my time on a game and actually live my life. 

Quitting video games was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I lost my community, my purpose in life, my self worth, and a huge part of my identity. Over the following weeks I’d develop severe anxiety, body dysmorphia, and a dangerously high blood pressure. I’d spend days without moving at all, with my brain on a constant loop thinking about what a piece of shit human being I was. 

Despite how much easier my life was while playing video games, I didn’t want to give up and return to where I was, so I kept pushing myself. My biggest hurdle was having absolutely no confidence in myself or my social ability. People would try to start conversations with me, and I lived in constant fear of disappointing them or wasting their time. This led to some really painful social interactions that would make me want to give up and hide, like I should accept that I’ll just be alone forever. 

Eventually I realized that it doesn’t make sense to give other people that much control over my happiness. I set a goal for my life that I’m confident I can achieve, to give me something to think about other than my loneliness. I got a job, started going to the gym regularly, and I’ve used my free time to develop my programming skills. Knowing that I’m working towards a goal does 2 things: it helps you feel good about the work you put in each day, and it allows you to care less about other people’s opinions. Since developing this mindset I’ve had so much more fun talking to people! Sure, I say awkward shit almost constantly because I have aspergers and my processing speed isn’t the fastest, but I don’t let it get me down. When people can tell you’re enjoying a conversation, they’ll try to talk to you more regardless of whatever awkward shit you say. 

It’s been a horrible, horrible journey but I genuinely like the person I am now. I see my good qualities more clearly than my negative ones. I wake up most mornings excited for what I get to do that day. 

Good luck for everyone battling with depression, unless you’ve been through it it’s really hard to understand just how terrible depression is. The most important thing I’ve learned is you can never give up. You’ll have days that go so poorly you just want to put a bullet in your head and end all this bullshit. The hardest thing to do is to push past those feelings, understand tomorrow is a new day with new possibilities. And usually, the next day won’t be as bad (it might even be a good day!) individual days won’t be as bad if you can just focus on the progress you’ve made."
1668,depression,everything feels so out of reach,"don't really know how to describe it besides that.

I don't even feel like getting out of bed most of the time. Most of the time I'm just grateful to have made it through the day, but as of recently I feel so much worse. I want to feel like I have a life again. idk I deleted all my social media apps off my phone and it honestly was a pretty good thing for me for the past few months, but I stupidly downloaded some back out of curiosity and that just reminded me of all of that again. like its always something that has been at the back of my head but seeing it online just brought it to surface"

I am 20 years old, never been in any kind of relationship. Now, I am nearly at the brink of no return. Whenever I am alone, I go just a little more crazy in my mind. I hate the fact that I am still alive because I view it as a punishment for both me and people around me. I think of myself as a leech for both my family and friends, and I can’t truly talk to anyone around me about my problems. I feel like garbage 90% of the time with no hope of getting these negative feelings away. Whatever you think would help me not feel this way, please post in the comments. Thanks for your time."

1674,depression,I cant get over the past I wish I could just fucking stop ruminating,"I know this is sloppy but bare with me:

 I'm 14M and the past year 2020 for me especially april/may-february has been a clusterfuck and the worst part is after the whole thing not while it was happening. Ever since february (when I started severly ruminating about the year before)  all I could think of the whole day was what I haven't done last year and how much better everything would be if  last year I did what I fucking want to now. I'm not going to be publics about it, but last year I had one interest I would spend all day on. I was somewhat depressed because I had a lot of fights with my parents april and one involved the cops getting called and they came to my house, starting saying I need to change and be fixed (I didnt want to )and  I think that basically changed most of my life. After that my main interest it took over my life after that I didn't talk to my parents and I spent all the time in my room. It was covid as you probablyt know so I couldnt do anything. All the time I spent was alone in my room. But that's just some background info. Now the main thing is my rumination of what I could've done in May-august 2020 aka when it was before 8th grade school but I had all free time. The thing I liked then  was all I spent my time on. I'm just going to say it it was hip hop/rap music, thats all I cared about then but the thing is all I did was fucking argue about it on the youtube comments and dumb ass shit like that. Then in september school started and I stated to want to have more interests and passions but then for some reason I didnt I guess and stuck with it. I barely remember anything from september-december 2020 even though I remember stuff a whole year and more before that perfectly. In february I started being more interested in another interest/passion/hobby film/tv and then other types of music. Which is 2 hobbies a much wider variety. I also just wished I would had other interests hobbies. From feb-now that's all I could think of, how I wish my interests/hobbies were different when I had the time. There are moments, usually spanning a few days, where I think forward and more positive. But 98 percent of the time from feb-now all I can think of is how I wish I just went back to may or so 2020. I just fucking hate that I can never get that time back and I wasted it all on something I show a bit of interest I don't want to do at all. I look at other stories of depression and feel jealous that they had more than one inerest or had any interests at all.  I just can't fucking explain it. I know I have my whole life ahead of me but then fucking high school, is starting and I wish I could be happy for it but now all I want to do is skip freshman year and go next year or just pretend I'm 13 and that I'm turning 14 next year and forget everything about last year or pretend I was born a year after I was. I wish life was that way. I just typed the first things on my mind because I can't think straight for some reason. I hope at least one person would understand this paragraph though.  I cant fucking  cope with my constant interest changes too because I was always that type of person to switch main inteerests every 5 or so months but no obsession I had has been as severe as the one to what i liked in 2020 the worst moment the one I wish had changed. I like something different now and I wished that was what my obsession was, not what it actually was. Better yet I could've been a normal person and what I was before then and had more than 1 interests at once.  .Anyways I just need to stop ruminating about the fucking past it is driving me crazy thats all Ive been doing 24/7 for the past 5/6 months I cant take it. . Every singe thing I see reminds me of it and I cant fucking take it. 

The reason my writing was so sloppy is because everyone I tell the story to they all mock me and say that my life is ahead of me and I should stop worrying and just instead of thinking about he past do those things now even though I fucking hate how I fucked up time and my life. 

I can tthink straight or tell this story straight I told it the most straightforward way I could and it still is a mindfuck comprehending what I can say. I just have so much on my mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now this is 10 minutes after I wrote this I can think straight moreso. For some reason the main problem of this I cannot quite decipher in my mind in words. I know what it is, but I can't. I dont blame you if you don't understand my main problem in my paragraph, but I do have one. Id also rather have people say what my problem is then tell me just how to get over the past (most other people I see that have trobule getting over the past have a completely different problem of it than I do This is a throwway for obvious reasons since it would be an embarrasment to my main account that I put this on there."
1675,depression,My life is ruined but it's still not enough,"Imposter Man is what I secretly call my ex bc he's not the same person he used to be, at all.  And this new version of him is relentless in his efforts to manipulate and stage anything he can to just destroy me.  This version of him is like a toxin that poisons life around him, he's like a malicious cancer, a psychopath.  Im making some kind of a record of what I experience and how I interpret it bc I am afraid that if I don't, there will come a day when I'll be accused of not having seen it, not having an issue, that the moment when I couldve been validated will come and be dismissed bc I never said anything.  I'm afraid to say anything and who would I tell?  It sounds impossible and crazy.  But I do see it and I have no answer to get this person out of my life, is it any surprise he's such good friends with my stalker?  No, I think bad ppl keep like minded bed buddies (figure of speech but I just think they are cut from the same cloth)."
1676,depression,I’m completely lost,"For the past two years I’ve been slowly losing my social life and covid had nothing to do with it. So in 2019 something happened in my life that left me emotionally devastated, I isolated myself for months. After a while I started coming out more and hanging out with friends but it never felt the same, I would come back home and immediately I would start crying. Over time I would become more and more introverted. Fast forward to now, I’ve gotten worse, I have zero to no friends, I’ve been contemplating giving up on life entirely, and I’ve been feeling so damn empty that it hurts. I can’t talk to anyone to save my life, I’ve become an extremely dry talker, and I just don’t have the motivation to put myself out there anymore. I don’t know what’s going on with me and I don’t know how to fix it. I feel alone and meaningless. What should I do to snap out of it?"
1677,depression,I imagine different scenarios where I kill myself,"These scenarios pop into my head when I’m laying on my bed, feeling miserable, and makes me want to cry.

The closest I’ve been to doing it was 2 years ago, I felt this urge to crash my car into another or into a wall while driving on a highway.

I’m not sure if I’m actually depressed. I’d say that I feel “normal” a half of my day, but I get sudden rushes of self-hate/regret/humilliantion feelings that make me want to kill myself, so that leads me to think about suicide daily. 

I hate everything I do, I hate who I am. I am socially retarded, academically useless. A plain waste of space, money and oxygen."
1678,depression,Any Advice?,"Disclaimer, I'm on a throwaway.

I come from a household where there is a lot of stigma and lots of shaming for anything relating to mental illness where there's a lot of the ""why can you just do it"" and the ""thanks I'm cured"" kind of attitude, so I haven't been medically diagnosed yet (I'm a teen (M) ), but I believe I might have some symptoms of depression. I've always thought I'd had it, so I thought it would be good to talk about coping advice with other people and recieve some validation rather than live in a kind-of limbo where I don't know what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really ""close"" to any members of my family because honestly, they haven't always been the greatest to me. For example when I was kid I quickly learned not to trust my parents because they would use things I said against me or punish me not so great ways, and this fallout would last in a week of screaming, crying, hiding etc. They don't even know what I like to do, my hobbies, and my skills etc. It's been better as a teen, but still I can't work off the past, so I often feel ""trapped"" or ""alone"". Their actions and behaviors definately manifested a lot of anxiety in me, and it took years before I could actually look people in the face (I still struggle to do that). Anyways, I think this might have been a large part in creating my supposed depression, but honestly I have no clue.

&amp;#x200B;

Nowadays I have like waves of ""trances"" (if that's what I could call them?) where for days at a time I can't make myself do anything and I lose motivation (even taking a shower is hard) and I often can't make myself make food even if I'm hungry. In these periods I sleep like 18+ hours everyday until I have coldsweats and my parents always belittle me for being lazy, even though I feel horrible. The worse thing is that I'm losing motivation for things I like to do, and I just stare at the ceiling and feel bad about not doing anything. I just feel ""stuck/traped"" or ""in a dream"", if that makes sense? Like I wanna runaway/just not exist anymore. I also don't really ""feel"" anything? Like everything's just gray and uninteresting and I am not, per se, ""sad"", but I'm not like happy either.  I also recently heard about high-functioning depression and that really struck a chord with me. I appear pretty normal to my friends and ussually I can get things done, but right now it's gotten harder.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, because it's not diagnosed I can't get any kind of treatment, so I would love to have tips on how to just try to make it through? Personally I found daydreaming and just staring at the sky to be a bit effective, but I don't think that's a healthy coping mechanism... The stuff online isn't really helping either, so I thought maybe asking other people who have some similar experiences what to do?"

I’m not unmotivated, I want to get better and I’m ready to put in as much work as possible to get better. However I’m starting to worry that my entire life will be this struggle. I don’t know if I have the energy. Especially as I know things are likely to get more difficult. I worry that I’m fundamentally not able to do it. I can get far but then the smallest thing will break me. 

Even now, when things are looking up for me theres this dark cloud looming. Sometimes for no reason I start to feel it. Other times I just see it there, waiting for things to fall so it can cloud my mind again.

1695,depression,Depression due to being unable to work an introverted job,"I'm 24F and feel really backed into a corner when it comes to my career and work life. I am in university doing a BSc. in Microbiology and have thrown myself into working more for the timebeing because it's summer break. I recently had the realization that I feel extremely drained when I am around people for too long, and being a barista at Starbucks contributes to that since the job requires you to act extroverted and be excessively nice to the public. Anytime I get quiet or awkward around a customer, I get roasted by management and am asked to ""be more assertive"" and ""outgoing"". I absolutely pity myself and I want better for myself because I know customer service jobs don't suit me. However, I also need the money to pay for my housing and for schooling once I go back in September. I am  desperately trying to search for introverted jobs in my city, but there is not much available. The few replies that I have gotten back from recruiters are jobs in sales or other food/hospitality jobs that require me to be outgoing. I am underqualified for the few introverted jobs available in my city, such as medical laboratory technologist because I don't even have my BSc. completed yet. I'm tired of faking being outgoing. 

Any advice on how to cope or what to do to make things easier on myself mentally until I can finish my BSc.?"

The kid gets dragged into this hell, forced to exist now. Dealing with the pain and struggle life brings to everyone. It only worsens with time, as you get older things get harder. Your parents eventually die, leaving alone with that grief and pain in this cold world. Kids who are still born or die young, aren't missing anything. They just avoid the worse parts of life. Sometimes I wish I died as a kid, never losing my innonce. Never being exposed to addiction and anxiety. Expectations to be independent never placed on me.

I got a job (my first) about a month ago, and they are sort of threatening that they will make me quit if I do poorly in school (mind you my parents are the type to think that C's are bad, and bs are barely acceptable). Why make me quit a job where I'm making money just because I did poorly, it's not like my job is something that affected the grades because I've always had shitty grades.

1711,depression,"I'm sick of waking up every day, I just want to end it all","I am alone and I feel alone. Depressed all the time and unwilling to do anything

I have failed in everything I have done in my life. I don't have a family, I couldn't finish university, and I lost many years. I have a job that I don't like, and in a position that is usually held by people 6 or 7 years younger than me.

  
I wish I could say that all this was because I had a great time, I was partying, or something else. But the reality is that since I was 17 years old I have been medicated for problems of depression and anxiety. Some days I had panic attacks thinking about leaving the house.

I'm going to be 34 in a few weeks, And nothing has improved. I am still alone, I still feel bad, I continue with the medication to withstand the anxiety every day, pills to be able to sleep  
   
The few people I have contact with are starting a family and having children. I don't even have a house of my own or for rent. I can hardly pay to have my own room and even if it were so, it would be to go live and be alone, because I practically do not relate to anyone, no matter how much I try  
 

All my life, people have laughed at me or used me, and yet I tried again and again to make friends with someone, to have a person to talk to. And nothing. I have only gotten people to approach me who try to scam me money, and nothing more.  
 

I don't want to wake up more every day like this. Because it's not just that I feel bad because I don't like my life, it's that I feel ashamed that people ask me about it. Co-workers and others, I feel ashamed when they comment on their life, their travels, their families, and I am afraid when the moment comes for someone to ask me something. Shame. As if apart from feeling depressed about my life, feeling that I am guilty of having done something wrong  
 

The only reason I have not finished with everything is not to hurt my parents, my sister or my niece. I don't want my niece to ask one day where her uncle is and they have to answer that I'm not here anymore.  But every day I see more likely that it will be how everything ends"
1712,depression,Trying to feel something.,"I was very depressed in high school and worked hard to get better. However, this past year has been difficult. I feel like I’m a faking being ok. I went skydiving, one of my lifelong bucket list items and pretended to be excited/nervous. Tbh I felt nothing. In the plane I felt numb. When I jumped out, it’s almost as if I didn’t care if just died. I didn’t even enjoy it either. 

I then got into gambling. I’ve lost thousands. Couldn’t care less really."
1713,depression,Romantic/sexual scenes on movies or tv shows often make me bring me to tears and I wish I had friends,"I’ll just be watching a movie/show and then once the sex/romantic scenes pop up I get really sad and end up crying because I don’t have/have never had that. Sometimes I actively avoid watching shows/movies that I know have sex scenes because I know they’ll make me sad. Even after organsming from masturbation I end up crying. I’m 23 and have been living with my grandparents during the pandemic. I have no friends in the area, no car. I’ve tried online dating, but I’m not the “ideal type” I guess in the area. Most convos go nowhere. All people are interested in is sex and, if they’re not, I’m not up to their standards.

I love my grandparents, but I want to be around people my own age. I’ve tried reaching out to my cousins and they’re not interested. I spend time stuck in the house all day (aside from going to the store with my grandmother on the weekends and going out for a run) taking care of my grandfather who has dementia. I just want to enjoy my 20s and have fun experiences before it’s too late for that. I feel resentful towards my family just a little because people help out when they want. They can come to the house to visit my grandad when they want and get to leave when they want (and go on Facebook to say how much they enjoyed visiting their brother when most of the time they were here they went out to visit other people. They don’t deal with the pee pee on the floor, the tantrums, putting on his clothes, trying to get him to shower and being met with intense anger, the funk, and the shadowing of caregivers that dementia patients are known to do.

When I vent about the feeling behind feeling in regards to relationships my mom/aunt/sister tell me don’t worry. You’re not missing out on anything. In fact your saving tears. I feel like everyone just sees me as a child and still sees me as the baby. Even my mom said “I bet yo when Hashbrown9819 has her first kiss she’s going to think that’s going to be her husband.”"
1714,depression,I feel like I’m playing against God and I’m losing,"I’ve been super depressed as usual but I’ve also been try to better myself and be more productive.

I have hobbies/endeavors I’d say I’m passionate about and have been trying to put more effort towards that, but everything I touch turns to shit. Things get broken, emergencies pop up, inconveniences keep me from advancing.

Sure I keep going or whatever but damn... I kinda want a win. I don’t expect everything to come easy but it’s a bit annoying when it genuinely feels like fate is working again you personally.

Honestly I can feel myself spiraling and going into a darker place every second. At this rate there’s no way I make it another month."
1715,depression,I’m giving up,"I’m done. It’s not like I have many friends or family that cares about me. I’m not able to keep a job and so I haven’t been working because of my mental illnesses. I have nothing to show for. I’m not going to spend the rest of my life trying to make others happy when I’m not. Nobody needs me. They only say they do when they need a shoulder to cry on, but after that I am nothing to them. My life sucks, so this is my goodbye to you all. Hope things go better for you because they sure didn’t for me"

1720,depression,Goodbye,I’m finally doing it. I’m finally deciding to end my life. Farewell
1721,depression,I feel nothing,"Idk if this is depression or something more (bc there are other symptoms unusual for clinical depression alone) but, I just can't feel any positive emotions. It's just a constant flatline of nothing. That is, until I get hit with random anxiety, self-hatred, or suicidal thoughts. 

The only thing that makes me feel ""stable"" is music. If I just sit and listen to music, I can feel okay. But, nothing else helps. Nothing I used to like gives me pleasure anymore. I know that should be obvious but, I've never had it this severely. Even if I didn't play my piano, I'd at least enjoy seeing others do it. But, no. Not even that helps anymore.

I've accidentally gotten addicted to more unhealthy things in the past in an attempt to have an emotional failsafe to fall back on. Drugs, porn, etc. These have been working less and less until they finally just stopped doing anything.

I feel empty. Just a shell of a human being. What's the point in life if you can't give a genuine smile every now and then? 

I feel like this is causing me to become more and more reckless. I'm so apathetic of everything that I'm doing anything to try to feel something. I'm afraid I might do something I'll regret but, on a much larger scale, I just don't give a fuck. I literally can't bring myself to care."

1723,depression,I finally told somebody I’m considering suicide,"I’ve had the thoughts for at least 4 or 5 years and serious thoughts for about a year. I told a childhood friend that I’ve known since I was 3 (22 now) that I’ve been thinking about it for awhile now. She lives far away so I don’t know how much it will help, if at all. But at least it’s something. I think what has stopped me is on paper my life should be almost perfect but I definitely don’t feel that way. Anyways, thanks for reading"
1724,depression,Attempting to be optimistic,"It turns out that I can only enroll for one subject only for this semester. Lucky it’s a short semester. If it wasn’t for the meds, I’d be panickin attackin. But somehow I feel optimistic about it. That means I have time to settle myself and be gentle. 

Recently, i broke up with my boyfriend because my depression made me that way. I just don’t want to deprive him of affection and love because of me. It’s leaving me some more time for me to work on myself. 

Also, I’m in the progress of decluttering and cleaning my room to make it more habitable for my mental health.

But I always feel so guilty for feeling bad because ik some rough stuff has happened to me, especially this past year but I still feel like I shouldn't feel bad. I have a great family, I'm getting a good education, I have a job and I have the best friends I could ever hope for but I still seem to find fault with life and I feel so stuck and angry"

1730,depression,"I’m so fucking tired, help me","(Rant) Ever since I was 11, I self harmed, and destroyed my body piece by fucking piece. I started getting really bad hormonal acne and I pick at it constantly because of how self conscious I am about it, and in my head if I pick at my problems gradually they’ll just magically go away. But it got worse over time, just like with everything else.

I would love to lie and say that covid made me this way, but it didn’t. Not going to lie, a year before covid started I was getting a lot better but then I moved again and my desperation got worse.

I moved a lot as a child because we were poor. And we always have been.
I look at other teenagers and think “wow, I wish I had that house,” or “I wish I had friends to visit and watch movies with them.” 
My mom told me one night while she was drunk that my (alcoholic) father wanted her to abort me because he didn’t want a girl.
I hate my dad and he knows it, I’ve hated him since I was small. He told me mother that I can’t rightfully kick him out of my life until I’m 18. I messaged him on Facebook and told him that I never want to hear from him again. He never even opened the message but he updated his profile picture yesterday. 

He never cared about me. That’s another thing, I’m that cliché “black girl with a deadbeat father”. Hence why I now only like white/Hispanic/ Asian guys. And that’s a serious fucking issue that I am so ashamed of, But all 7 of my siblings have different fathers who are all black and they all don’t give a shit about either one of us. I am just so afraid I’ll continue the cycle if I date a black man.

I wish I was a white girl, with a nice boyfriend who falls at my feet for literally just standing there and being blonde with a cup titties.

I’ve had a crush on my best friend who moved to california, miles and miles away from me, since the third grade and I’m about to be a junior now.

Time is going too fast and I can’t keep up. I can’t make new friends anymore, I don’t feel passion for the things that I used to, I have urges to hurt myself and other people who have done me wrong. 

The world would be so much better without people like me."
1731,depression,I’m so tired of wishing I was dead.,"I think about wanting to be dead, or killing my self at least three times a day. I’m overwhelmed with the burden my depression has created for me and my family. I’m exhausted trying to be “mindful” and grateful, and letting go and fighting a LITERAL war inside my head. How can I go on indefinitely with this? I can’t. That’s why I want to be dead."
1732,depression,*sigh* here we go again,"

I don’t know what to do
1735,depression,"I'm fucked up in the Head, don't be mean please","I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety,
I am severely suicidal, have low self worth and hate being around people because it makes me anxious to the point of wanting to break down on the spot. This has gotten to the point where I don't want to leave my room or talk to any human being at all. I get so paranoid with people that I automatically believe that they believe what I believe about myself. Even if I'm told the opposite I always feel like I'm right and that their lying. I can't help it. I get so paranoid that I see things mostly in the night, I see wierd shadows that seem like demons. I'm always wanting them to kill me because I can't do it myself. In the day time I just get paranoid that someone is there watching me when I'm alone. When it comes to my few friends and lover I just believe that if I do something wrong it will ruin our whole relationships and I start getting worked up over little things and get compelled to say sorry about everything. I get paranoid that they all don't care about me, that I'm annoying. I know it's dumb but even when they reassure me I just believe my own thoughts. Doctors are no help because I can't bring myself to trust any of them. I just feel like dying and that I'm a waste of space. I'm basically insane at this point so there's no use anyway, I'm just a fuck up."

I thought this was my dream job but now it's awful.  The harrassing guy told all my coworkers I go around reporting people so everyone is avoiding me plus the original harrassment has never stopped.  I have social anxiety so it's already hard for me to deal with people.

I lost a child custody battle recently because the other party had more money for better lawyers an kept appealing every decision until they got the verdict reversed.  

I broke up with two lifelong friends because their own mental health issues caused them to blow up on me.  I have reached such a low mental health point I couldn't take it anymore.  Finding unprompted angry text my ""friend"" wrote me again and again I couldn't handle it.  I don't usually cry but I broke down about this.  I am  approavhing middle an"
1739,depression,It’s time I ask for help,"Hey guys I’m just gonna start off by saying I’m not sure if I should be posting this here and I’m so sorry if I put in the wrong place and sorry if this is so long but I just need to get this shit off my chest. To put this all into context I’ll need to add that I am 19 and I cook in Detroit, the food scene is great and and cooking is my passion. It has saved my life and I love it more then anything. When I go and work everything outside it stops. All of my problems just fade away for the 5 hour service we have. I only focus on making people happy and I cannot describe to you the feeling I get when I see somebody get served the food I pour my heart and my soul into and they just smile. I know it’s probably a little hard to understand, (like it’s just food who gives a fuck) but this is truly my life’s passion. But to get the actual point. The thing I love most is killing me. This is the first time I have ever admitted that I have depression. I am the person who suffers silently and who will never ask for help. It’s just not who I am. My parents have no clue, nor do my brothers. My girlfriend has some idea but I hate burdening her with my shit because i don’t want her to worry. Working 70 hours a week is really fucking tough. I get up go to work and go home. Rinse and repeat. I’ve developed just a sadness about my life. I lay awake at night just thinking how I’m gonna keep doing this for the next 40 years. And yes the easy answer would be to just switch careers. I could do that but I it’s easy working these hours. It’s just really hard to watch everybody else around me living life while I just work. I have lost 30 pounds in 6 months. And I just feel like I’m drowning. Again sorry this is so long but I just needed to vent to people I’ll never meet."
1740,depression,Thank you for all the support everyone has given me here,Huge thank you. I am very grateful. I am very lucky for everyone who has helped me go through these sad and honestly terrifying feelings. I get panic attacks and they feel very bad and scary and I worry so much. It feels do good that so many of you have been supportive. I needed it so badly. Thank you.

1744,depression,It gets harder every day,I have been dealing with depression since as long as I can remember im currently 18(m) I just can't. I cant remember stuff its said straight to my face I forget it 5 sec later I feel so stupid I messed up my graduation walk today in practice an I got laughed at now im worrying it'll happen on Friday in actual graduation ik the teachers mock an hate me I can see it in all their faces. I went to drop off my school laptop an then the lady says ×this is the boy I'm talking about× straight to my face an the other teachers started laughing I felt so embarrassed I asked what I did an they laughed more. May own parents have been mocking me since I was a kid bcs of this. I hate it. They would usually put som down an tell me to search for it knowing I'd forget the location and laugh while the item is literally infront of me. Idk if this gave me ptsd but when im asked to look for something I get so nervous an start sweating. With depression I've also lost sleep I sleep at 4am every single day. I barley eat at all if not for days. I currently moved away from my mom to live with my dad bcs we never got along but my dad is worst he mocks me for my eating disorder. An sometimes pushes me an laughs saying im weak. I hate it. And not to talk about relationships too. I've only dated two girls in my life an it was online I've never met them ever. The last girl I was so in love with started treating me like shit. The most hurtful thing she said was ×when I think of you I feel nothing× she made me so happy so fucking happy just to say that. On top of that she sent a vid of her an the guy she cheated on me with in her room. I ghosted her an she came back months later saying she had sex with him. Which hurted being that we planned on meeting up an doing it. But I'm currently a virgin. I always tried to have a smile on my face while talking to her I remembered days she cried to me an I made her laugh. Taking on her pain as mine. Now when I see ppl happy I feel empty and dead. An the pressure of finding someone to hold on to is getting to me. With the pressure of being mocked as an 18yr virgin. I look around in my mind trying to think of something or someone who makes me happy and all I have is me. I'm trying to love myself more but its difficult. Idk anymore the days go by an I get tired more an more. I need help.
1745,depression,Redundancy of Life,"I find myself having such a poor and rotten mood almost all the time, and putting on a facade when I'm with people/on a call. And for the past year it's just been the same thing day in and day out. Walks help sometimes but it's like I know I'm trying to merely distract myself. It's the same with video games. I'm not ready to live an adult life and the thought of the cycle of waking up, going to work, coming home, and then sleeping only to repeat until I die, maybe with the occasional fun on weekends, makes me sick to my stomach. I think about killing myself when I shower, and while I try to fall asleep. My roommate seems to in essence ignore me and goes out to do things and hang out on their own. I think if I killed myself people won't find out until months after the fact; maybe they wont notice at all. I don't interact with many people if at all. I haven't been sleeping well either. I guess I'm just venting here. I feel so lonely, I ought to just curl up and die. I don't think there's a place for me in this world; it's not worth making one."

Sleeping is so hard with this pain. It’s been 6 months and I don’t know how to keep fighting this and living normally with this.... doctors have been unable to help me. Meds don’t help me..."
1748,depression,Finally doing better (for now),"Just wanted to document this for myself and maybe motivate or lift up others. If hearing/reading about others doing better and finding motivation just makes you feel worse, I understand, I’ve been there, but please don’t read this. 

After 3 months of laying in bed all day, everyday just with my thoughts and sleeping 3/4 of the day, my aunt practically forced me to join her in a zumba class yesterday. I don‘t know what happened or where I got that energy from, but jumping around in a room full of middle aged women (I‘m 22) somehow made fun once I didn‘t give a f** how I looked doing it. 

After that I fell asleep early yesterday and today I‘m awake much earlier than usually (8 am, for people who work that‘s nothing, I know, but I usually try to sleep until I can‘t anymore until 2 pm). I kind of have the energy to go for a morning run while listening to loud music right now and want to actually do something for my bachlor thesis after that. Crazy plans I know. Writing it here to somehow remind myself of that hope, energy and motivation that I‘m feeling in the moment, before it passes (like it usually does).

I also started taking Vitamin D supplements (but that was like 2 days ago, so I don‘t think it made any difference until now) but I really like the feeling of finally having done something good for myself. Please god don‘t take this feeling of motivation away before I at least accomplish a little bit today. 

If someone read this, I wish you all the motivation in the world today. Try to get Vitamin D. If you can‘t make it out of bed today, it‘s ok. Try to open the window on your way to the toilet when you have to go and just stand a few minutes in the fresh air and maybe the sun if it shines through that window. Try to be proud of yourself because you made it through another day. And maybe, if you are lucky enough like me to have someone who can force you to go out and do something, tell them! Maybe sometimes we can‘t force ourselves, but someone else can. (Not in all cases, I understand that, but sometimes.) Take every little hormone, that makes you feel better, you can with you!"
1749,depression,"I’m worried that no matter how good my life gets, I’ll still have this void that will never be filled","I’m at a point in my life where I don’t know what I’m doing. I often feel lost and miserable. My friends are becoming distant and I just don’t feel like myself anymore. 

I occasionally have random bursts of hope. That I will get things together, and I’ll get to do the things I want to do. Hang out with friends, travel etc. But there’s also part of me that worries that even if I get to do these things, I’ll still have this void inside me. Maybe the void will be a bit smaller, but it will always be there. Like a storm cloud of worry, sadness, and emptiness that never truly leaves."

But last 2 weeks i'm barely functioning. Some small things happened, that might just be inconveniences for anyone else, but they are destroying me form the inside.

I haven't talked to friends in weeks, I barely eat and I'm afraid I'm gonna be fired soon, because I can barely come to work, let alone do something.

1755,depression,I wanna blow my brains out but how do make it so my friend doesn’t feel bad?,[removed]
1756,depression,I always asked myself if I’d be able to feel anything when someone I knew was going to die. I found out today.,"I’ve (m23) been bipolar for probably close to twelve years now. It feels like my empathy and compassion has eroded away to the point of barely feeling anything anymore. I’m not sure if I love my family; I don’t feel any real attachment to them any more.

Anyways, today my step-father (m41) was admitted to the ICU with acute liver failure, and it looks like he is not going to make it. 

My mom (m47) called me to talk about it, she said he was getting a blood transfusion but it might not matter. She sounded shaken up, and the first thing I told her was, “that sucks.” I felt no emotion or shock at the news or what I said. I responded as if someone had told me that their plant died or they missed a bus.

I realized that I must be pretty numb, and that I might be decaying in my own quiet way. 

My step dad and I never really got along, he was kind of a douche, but I realized that he was also something of a victim, an addict who was orphaned relatively young. I still think I should be able to feel something, but all this has done is show me how much I’ve really wilted away."
1757,depression,How to help my friend?,"Hi, I’m very worried about my friend. He suffers from severe depression and other issues. 
Yesterday he told me how bad he has been feeling again and I am very sad because of it. I cannot stand it seeing him suffering all the time and this really drags me down sometimes. 
When he opened up to me about his problems the first time, I’ve have always been there for him and I was actually able to convince him to see a therapist. It was better for a while but I don’t know how long it has been since he is feeling worse again. 

I try to be as supportive as possible and tell him how I’m always standing by his side, care about him and all… but since his depression has got so severe once again, I feel like I am useless and not doing a good job at helping him. I mean he trusts me and all because if he didn’t, he would have never opened up to me. 

Do you guys know how I can support him? And/Or what I can tell him to feel a bit better?
I’m afraid that he might does something stupid and I want him to find happiness and a reason to live on again."
1758,depression,I’m shocked,"I was on the phone with my mom earlier tonight, and my sister came into my moms room and asked her if I was ok because she knows how bad I’ve been feeling lately. I’m so fixated on that because it’s surprising to me that anyone would care about my well-being in general. But yes, I know It’s such a small thing, but for a second, I felt like I was actually worth something and not just an absolute worthless piece of shit, and it made me smile. I feel weird lol 🙃"
1759,depression,"I’m being referred for an ECT consultation, how has it gotten to this point?","I (23M) have PDD, my whole life has been bleak since childhood. I was always sensitive, although I was smiling more due to the innocence of childhood and exploring the world, I was shy and lived far away from people I went to school with. I failed to connect with people outside of a school environment. My parents worked a lot so I’d come home to essentially an empty home and a babysitter who was no replacement for a parent. I had no one to talk to if I was proud of something or sad. This caused me to become desperate for friends which pushed people away. 

I managed to stumble into a relationship in college but my ex gf abused me both emotionally and physically. I was left with all of my negative self beliefs validated by someone I thought loved me. I haven’t been intimate with anyone since that time and developed a strong distrust of people’s intentions (4 years ago). I have a few people I somehow met in college that I still sometimes see since we graduated but they all have more important people in their lives. I’m not important to anyone and I feel invisible. There’s nothing I offer that someone else can’t and they probably won’t be a miserable loser. No one besides my doctors and family knows about my condition and no one knows just how torturous everyday is for me.

Waking up is a disappointment and existing is tiring trying to pretend everything is ok. Meds haven’t worked since 8th grade and therapy/hospitals haven’t remedied anything either. My psychiatrist talked to me and said they’ve tried a lot and nothing has helped much so ECT should be strongly considered since my blood work is normal, no nutritional deficiency I guess. I have a consultation tomorrow. 

How has it reached this point? To have my body go through seizures to be happy? This is all I’ve known, I’ve never imagined being happy realistically. I’m risking my memories and ability to function at work for a non guaranteed chance at happiness. Is it worth it? Do I deserve happiness? This is all so much and I feel like I’ve disappointed my family for being so sad for 23 years. They’ve given me so many opportunities and I can’t even be happy. If anyone has experience with ECT I’d love to hear."
1760,depression,"i really don’t think school is for me, but there’s no other option. everything feels meaningless and school has numbed me","i hate school. of course mostly everyone hates school, for typical reasons like having to get up early, homework, studying and what not. yeah those suck obviously, but my hatred for school goes beyond that. school pains me so goddamn much. it probably doesn’t help that i live in a really homogenous closed in suburban small town, so the people here are snobby and closed minded. but besides that, i can’t imagine sitting inside a room listening to someone drone on about things i’ll end up cramming the day before a test and forgetting them after for 8 hours, on repeat for the next 3 years. and after those 3 years, that’s not even the end of it bc i’ll have to do the same with college. and then what happens after college? i have no passion for anything. life is so uninteresting to me. i used to be a very curious and excited sociable child, but i’m so damn numb to everything now. and on top of all of that, i have to pull all nighters studying and forgetting, half assing homework, study and forget, so on. i don’t think i can handle it anymore. the thought of doing this for another 3+ years enough for me to wanna kill myself. the staff at my school doesn’t give a shit for anyone, they just hang up mental health posters for show, yet never do anything about the insane fucking workload we have. i forgot to mention that my school in particular is very competitive, so our curriculum is more hardcore than other schools. i just cant keep up anymore. the education system expects a very specific character from students, and if you don’t fit nicely inside of that you’ll get left behind. i can feel myself dragging further and further away from that character. and i don’t want to fit inside it either. i just wanna have fun. i wanna enjoy things too. i know life is supposed to have its struggles, but why do i have to be dragged through hell and back in exchange for temporary surface level happiness? why cant it last? why do i consider killing myself 10 times before genuinely smiling 1 time? i cant keep repeating this cycle any longer. i think i’ll hurt myself if it keeps going on like this. i’m trapped."

I repeat these thoughts like a mantra every single day. Almost as though I’m trying to justify to myself I am allowed to feel the things I feel. I feel selfish, or rather, know I am, but don’t know to what extent that selfishness is caused by my mental struggles.

1769,depression,I hate being conscious,"Imagine that after you die, you awaken as a form of conscious as you are now, except you have no body, no feelings, no senses, and there is absolutely nothing that you can perceive. You are then left in this form of consciousness eternally. Now think of how it feels when you are completely out of breath, how it may feel to be suffocating or drowning. Pretend that on top of being conscious in a void of absolute nothingness, you also experience this extremely uncomfortable feeling of suffocation eternally. Firstly, this thought experiment on death makes the conventional idea of death comforting and even desirable. Second, this is an analogy to how it feels like to exist in this miserable fucking existence, as consciousness ruins it all. I add the part on not being able to breath, because this is how I would describe my mental atmosphere. Being conscious of my thoughts and situation is fucking insufferable, and internally it feels like I am suffocating on an abstract mental level, and there is nothing I can do about it. Its like have an extreme sunburn on your entire body, and every single position and movement is unbearable, another analogy to how I would describe being conscious. 

If i'm not aware of my thoughts or situation, then I am left with nothing whatsoever, because all forms of joy, interest, pleasure, and emotions are absent, and thus I left with an empty shell of myself that simply exists and has consciousness of this void of nothingness. I must be conscious every single day for hours, days, weeks, months, years, and still decades, when I can barely go through a day being conscious without wanting to fucking die. It is no wonder to me now why people abuse drugs, because they are a means of transforming consciousness into some other form that isn't the one we normally have. Conscious existence is a curse, the only thing I want is sleep, because that is when I am absent of consciousness. I wish that when I went to sleep I would never wake up, and would just experience occasional pleasant dreams with no full form of awareness forever. Maybe If I had something that I truly gave me enjoyment, I would be able to bear this painful existence. But alas, this cannot be, nothing is interesting or brings me joy. I recognize that everything serves as either a vain attempt to feel something, or simply as a distraction from consciousness. Perhaps I have a severe lack of dopamine, and am left to exist closer in line to an oyster thats aware then a well functioning human being. I could keep going, the point it, I fucking hate being aware of existence, because the simply act of being conscious instills suffering and becomes unbearable, and I just wanna fucking kill myself to end it."
1770,depression,Don't you fucking dare give me that philosophical shit in the comments.,"I see a lot of people here asking one common question which is - WHY ME. Why do I have to face all the bad luck while others lead a happy life. 

The answer is very simple if you're willing to understand - FUCK PEOPLE. IT HAS TO BE YOU OVER ANYONE ELSE (INCLUDING YOUR PARENTS). please stop living your life as per societal norms and some karmic shit. 

If someone does bad to you, reciprocate even harder so that they know who they messed with. 
If someone does good to you, good for you. Don't carry this baggage that you've to be nice to them for the rest of your life. 

Start fucking with emotions, your own and of people around you. The moment you stop giving a fuck about what your heart wants you'll be at peace. TRUST ME. 

Be practical. Let this be a give and take thing. Start seeing people and relationships as one time fixed contracts. When you're done with them, leave. Stop giving fucks about how they would feel and shit like that. Start using people if you want to be happy. You're not here to be a spiritual guide lmao. 

Start living your life and fucking with people's lives."

But during it, I was thinking about my old friends, and now I am absolutely dead inside waiting if they will answer my messages. (You will die of old age reading this)","As you saw from the title, this is going to be mega long. 

I moved into this brand new building in early october last year, and I have been trying to get fiber (or some kind of permanent connection) ever since.

I am 100% a loner. I am on my computer, I sleep, I eat, I work (part-time), and sometimes I go out to do the groceries.

As I am writing this I seriously think I should stop. I feel so stupid.

So internet. What I did not know at the time was that there wasn't any when I moved in.
That lead to some very confused calls from me to my current (at the time) Internet provider, the main Internet company (my isp is subsodiary or some shit, cannot explain in english), and the costumer service for the company that owns my building.

That person at my isp was telling me this, this other person was telling me that, etc, etc, until I got a call from a superior. She said that I had to do a thing that did not make any sense (sorry, that was so long ago) with the main company. But I told her they told me that I had to pay for that. Kinda like 2 subcribtions. She said you did not have to pay, I answered that they said I had. And so forth.

So I had enough and said ""just delete my contract, I cannot take this anymore"".

Oh my god you guys are actually going to die if I say everything, just don't read it. 

The only internet I had was on my phone, and I was wondering wtf to do.

So my friend (haven't talked to him since) said that I should make a contract with the company that he uses. They could provide me with a 4g box, and wait until real internet arrives. 

With chance, they have a shop right there. I make a contract for my 4g box (that fact is what almost killed me), went back home, plugged it in, and poof I had internet. I had a limit of 100go per month, so I quicly upgraded it to 200. 

The amount to delete the contract increased as well.

But who cares? I was going to get a permanent connexion soon!

So I called the costumer service and asked to make a fiber contract. They said that they could not do it over the phone and I had to go to a boutique.
But it was right there.
Right there the guy said that he could not make fiber contracts from his shop, that I had to go to one of the 2 malls.

This is probably one of the main raison they made me insane. Almost everything is a pain to do with them.

So I walked my ass to the bus station and went to the mall.

Part of the process to make the contract is that they show you a google map kinda thing, and you point your location. 

Before you ask, I have not make a mistake on the location.

Oh my, it said that adsl AND fiber were available!
So of course I chose fiber and got a appointement pretty soon. 

On my day off, perfect. The schedule said 12-16h, but he was here at 8. Even more perfect! 

After a few minutes, he said ""I do not have the right tools, another technician will contact you today"". And he left.
So I called CS (costumer service) to ask them wtf. CS called the technician who told them that he could not install anything because of the rain. 

Mmmm.

So the next day, I called cs again who called the guy again who FINALLY said that the reason he could not install the fiber was because there was no fiber in the building.

I lost, what, 2 days, because of this guy's bs?

So that was back to the bus to the mall for me.

Make an adsl contract. Another appointement very soon. Too suspicious. But wtf did you wanted me to say. I wasn't broken enough back then.

So the technician arrived, and a few minutes later told me that he could not install adsl because there was no adsl in the building.

But he at least had the decency to tell me right away, and even explain to me a few things.
The isp I was with before and the main isp I mentionned a few times have priority on the cables, or the isp I am with now had the get autorization.

Bottom of the line : no matter what happens, my isp would get internet access later than the first 2 isp.

Technician then left. I called cs and we talked about the fact that there was no adsl in the building, and probably would never be, because it would be a waste of money. 

So we talked about adsl, for a while, right?

The next day I got an email saying that my FIBER contract was deleted and there was no way to revert it.

So what happens when there is no adsl? We delete the fiber contract. Yes.

You guys must be dead, right now.

So since nobody could give me a straigt answer at the begining, exept for the technician, I had to call a higher up at my building's company (brother's old classmate) who did some work for me. 

Internet would arrive around valentine's day.

My appointement with the adsl technician was on dec 3. 

I waited patiently. 

Luckuly a commercial (a guy that comes to your house to make contracts) had left his card for the building, and feb 24, my fiber contract was made with an appointement for march 4.

With all the bs that happened to me and the meds that I have to take, now, I have trouble remembering certain things. Like when my sick leave is ending. I swear to god I wrote it down somewhere. I'll just have to go to work to ask.

Anyway. Will never forget march 4. 

The technician arrived. And he stayed longer than the others! 

Nope. A moment later he told me that he could not install the fiber because there was an error in the adress. Like they ordered fiber for somewhere else.

He stayed a while, on the phone with various people, while I was just sitting on my chair, dead inside.

They called me the next day or some shit to try to locate the building (""is there a parking lot on the left"" or some shit), I did not want to make a mistake (I am always like that) so I refused to answer the question. They then asked me if the main company had left a sign with numbers on it. It would indicate perfectly the building. 

I put some fucking clothes on and looked everywhere. Nothing. 

So I demanded that they send a technician or some shit, that would do technician things and say exacly what building it is. He came here. Twice, even. 

He now knew exactly the location, the complicated numbers, all that shit. So he made a report.

But now I had to wait for my order to be completed. The way it works, I think, the main compagny places an order for a certain place to a computer. And then we have to wait. There is no way to know how long the order will take.

This is when it started to get very very annoying.

To call the service that takes care of my stuff, I have to :

-Call the number
-Push *
-Push 1
-Push any phone number in their database that was not deleted, because it does not matter
-Push any number to join any service
-Say the actual phone number you are calling about
-Say your first name
-Say your last name
-Say your date of birth
-Say your adress
-Wait until the person introduces themselves
-Say that you want to join the fiber activation section
-Give a clear reason why 
-NEVER say that you are not at home, even for an update on your order (""yes your order is complete"" ""no your order is not complete""), because they will refuse to talk with you. I had to call again.
-Hope that the call doesn't end abruptly 

Because there are a LOT of services that you cannot join directly. Or some that you cannot AT ALL.

I would call all the time because I had nothing better to do or because I was upset.

So even with the bs with my last appointement (the 3rd), when my order was completed, they could not give me an earlier appointement.

I had an appointement for april 19th. So march 4th to april 19th.

Meanwhile I'm paying 75€ for 200go a month.

Few days before the appointement, I called a few times so that they check that the main company made the order with the numbers in the rapport the guy made.

Guess what happened on the 19th. Exactly the same thing. Exactly the same error. Even though the game came twice. Even though I called them to tell them to check the order.

Oh, and it was even the same technician. He was also very upset that he was put in the same situation twice.

While he was on the phone, I thought about taking my chair to help me jump off.

I was wondering how much I could take. How many technicians, how many phone calls, how many days for an order.

This time, I was more upset because I was suppose to be on my paid time off, april 23 to 29. I was really counting on my fiber, and you know, not mega stressed and angry.

You guys aren't reading anymore, I think.

So you know what I did during that time off? 

I called almost every day to tell them that they ruined my vacation, and that they should have listenned to me (when I said to check the order before the 19th), and that they had commited the same mistake twice in a row)

At that time, all the guys at the service knew me. 

Meanwhile all this bs, the service, and one of the superiors is actually working with the main company (because I guess the 2 other times they weren't????), so that the main company can make the order with the numbers provided by the rapport of the other guy.

And the order waiting started.

But at the same time, the stress was affecting my body too. I have not had my period for 2 months, and then I started to have bad period pain, but barely anything was coming out

So on may 7 I went to the doctor for some pain medicine.
After that, it started bleeding a lot. On may 12, I went back for something that would slow the bleeding (did not help at all).
On the 17 and the 19th (because the med melted because I did not realized it was that hot in my appartement) I went back for a minor problem that was fixed in 2 days.

Meanwhile, OF COURSE, other bs happened. On april 27 maybe, I got a call from their satisfaction service. He wanted to know my experience with a certain phone call. 

At this point, I was at at least 90 phone calls with them (not counting the times they called me). So I told him to leave me alone, something negative about the company, I had to go in the elevator. He said ""since you don't remember, I will call back"".

Someone called from their number, on the 28, but I guess that person's phone had a problem, because I would pick up, and it would immediatly hung up.

He called again on the 30th. Then the 5th may. Then the 7th may.

At this point I think I already called to complain about him (them, honestly, don't know who that fucker is). They cannot find him because he doesn't leave any traces on my file.

Since this bs started I keep my phone on, in case they call to tell me that my order is done and that I am free from their bs.

But with my health problems, I was in sick leave, and sleeping on a weekday. He called twice.

That time, I was not very upset.

But that night, I barely slept, because I felt so unconfortable because of the period blood and have to get up almost every hour to pee blood in the shower and get a thick thing of blood (don't know what it is called in english).

So I was sleeping again in the morning. When he called. At 10.35, 10.40, 11.17, 11.44, 11.45, 12.34 and 13.59.

I called cs to beg them to find him and tell him to stop. 

For those months there was a few crying. But when I was begging cs, I said ""I did not diserved this"". And  could not stop crying. 

I hung up and found an help hotline. They were able to calm down.

At that moment, I went from whatever the fuck I was to depressive. 

The next day, the 19th, I went to the doctor for some refill on the pain medicine and some antidepressants.

So I'm sorry, like I said, with all this bs, and the meds, I forget stuff. I had to get up to check a business card.

Yes, the business card that led me to the 4th march appointement.

Now I remember why I tried to commit suicide the first time.

Between this bs, they told me my order had failed. And said that by deleting the fiber contract and creating a new one, with the same informations, it would magically solve all the problems. 

They said that the same guy that made my contract would come on the 21. 

So the 21 arrives and I realize that they said many times the date, but not the time. I am extremelly tired, and I have to know if I can sleep a bit or just wait. I missed calls during this bs because I was too tired. So I had to know.

I call him. I rings a few times, then hungs up. I call a few more times. Same thing happens.
It is extremmely suspicious. Because when I called him months ago, it would ring a few times, then I would hear the message thing.

I called again and again, and finally it rang once and hung up. 

He was ignoring me.

I called cs and told them to call him, because I knew he would not decline a call from them. Apparently, something came up and he could not come.

Then I begged them to just send another commercial, that it's not complicated.
They told me that I had to go in the boutique. I said not. I am not going. It is not complicated. Then they said they had to give my file to the directors so that they could make a decision.

All the bs, all the tiredness, 3 months of torture. While they were on the phone saying their bs, I took one of my cheap razors and started braking it.

I did not know what I wanted when I started doing it. So I ended up only making superficial cuts. 

A few days before that, I was given the email for cs, so I wrote long emails about the torture, and the guy that was calling me, and other incompetances.

But that day, I took a picture right after I did it, and sent it with a ""I hope you are happy"".

I called the emmergency, put a few things in a bag (in case they wanted me to stay in emergench psychiatry) and waited on the first floor, on the stairs.

They had to call me (important for later), because it is a new building, they needes directions. But you know, like I said. Superficial cuts, was waiting downstairs. I was chill. 

I sent another picture, with doctors in the background, asked some questions, like ""if the order fails, or the technician cannot install the fiber, in how many years will I have it"" with a the end ""I'm adding another picture so that you don't forget me"".

I was surprised that I was able to go back home that same day.

In the emergency room, the psychiatrist gave me a pill, and when I was home, the only thing I wanted to do was sleep.
The next day I went to the doctor and begged him to call the emergency so that he could prescribe me those pills. So that I would not have to wait in mental pain. That was the 22th that I was given this prescription.

The 24th, it was around noon, and I cannot tell you if I was awake or not. But I was talking to my dear friend. I woke up, took my phone, and realized I did not have his number. But I had my other dearest friend's. But that number is almost 10 years old. So no luck.

I told myself ""I have to find the dvd"". One of those 2 friends and 1 female friend went to france to celebrate 1 other friend's 18th birthday.
But I had lost it in years. I thought I acidentally threw it away.

So for the first time that I actually needed it, I asked myself ""where would I put it?""

-it was given to me in a paper enveloppe : too fragile
-I do not own empty plastic boxes
-cardboard sleeves (demo cds) do not have enough space
-I am not getting rid of any cds

And it was in the first plastic box that I hopenned, I swear.

It was a dumb treasure hunt, 18 gifts. 

But it brought back so many memories. We are all internet friends, btw. We would play this free mmo, but we would be all the time on the forum, having fun and what not.

I was elected ""bouffon de la cour"", because I was bringing life to the non gaming section of the forum.
I wanted my friends back. I wanted my sanity back. I wanted to take my dvd with me and jump with it.

I put the dvd in my favorite album, took my phone, took my chair, and headed to the last floor.

It was locked, so I headed downstairs. I sat on my chair, because I knew it would hurt very much if I jumped, and called the emmergencies. 

The person convinced me to get back to my appartement, where I prepared a more serious bag with me (still kept my album) and headed downstairs, again. 

I spent the night in the psychiatry emmergencies. I was the only one.
I have a very bad memory from the day crew, when I left. The psychiatrist was the same from the emmergency room on the 21th, and the only thing he did to help was giving me my pill.

So the 25th, i was still desperate. I sneaked out to the emergy room. One person asked me who I was, and I started running to find something to hurt me.

The emergency staff (not the psychiatry one) held me, sat me down and said stuff like ""the psychiatry staff will talk to you"".

No one talked to me. Execpt the security guard, who told me I needed to find somewhere else to sit down because he wanted to write something.

I sat down in my assigned bed and kept the exact same position for more than 1h30min. I heard them order me a taxi to go home, heard them talk about their lives and stuff, laugh, and someone noticed my car wasn't there yet. Then it arrived and this nurse said, in a normal friendly voice, ""goodbye, madame Edc"". 

I looked her in the eye and said ""you know exactly what is going to happen next time.""

So it was still the 25th, and you are probably more dead than me at this point.

So the 25th, I still want to die, but I want to call someone. The psychologue that I saw during my time in a clinic en 2019.

She calmed me down.

So the 26. God, the 26. I completely forgot about that but it is a little mixed up. On the 21, my appointement with the commercial was moved to the 26. I am following my calls on my phone, at this point.

Commercial still ignoring me. I had enough.

This is where I have to tell you the fondation of this nightmare. The 4g box is my first contract. The others have never been activated, so they are all worth 0€. If I want to leave, I have to pay a fee (it's like between 400 and 600€) because I have an engagement for the 4g box.

They could delete everything. If I had problems. With the 4g box. Even with everything that happened, they don't give a shit and rather make me completely crazy, or dead.

I know this because I had asked multiple times.

But this time, the thought of waiting again, for something that is probably not going to work, the thought of a technician arriving and leaving right after, the thought of my sanity gone.

The razor blade was still there, next to the bed. While this person was talking about giving my file to a director, I took it and cut as long as I could. I kept cutting while that person was still on the phone while screaming in pain and saying ""everything is your fault"". I immediatly took 2 pictures and sent them to cs saying again ""I hope you are happy"".

I can't remember if I made my bag before or after. But anyway, this time, I had to wait the emmergencies in the house. There were drops of blood in a lot of places. The funny thing is that my bed barely felt the difference, with the period blood.

Jesus Christ I am getting bored of my own story.

So in the house they made a bandage thing (sorry, no medical knowledge), but my leg had still blood on it. While waiting in the emmergency room a fly was being very annoying.

I got 19 sutures. Or the doctor counted 19 while looking at every thread. The anesthenic needle hurts, but the sutures don't.
The main doctor visited me and I begged him that I see a psychiatrist, because I could not trust the others.

He helped me quite a lot.
And the next day, the psychiatrist, that I never met helped me out too. He said that I had to choose a nurse because my wounds require caring.

The day before, right after I arrived at the emmergency, my phone rang. It was a commercial. They apparently found one. But I was in the middle of suffering, so I said something mean and hung up.

So the next day I called him back, appologized, and he gave me an appointement for the next day, the 28th!
Good news, but how long and how many times the process was goinc to fail? 

The 28th, I first called the nurse to confirm our appointement. Then I did the same with the new commercial.

He said. He could not come because the directors do not want commercials sent to my house. 

I was so close. All he had to do was get there, and make the contract. I was going to get the contract, and legit not call them. Let them call me when the order or whatever would or not be ready.

I broke in tears, and called the nurse to cancel our appointement.

I took my album, my phone, my chair, and went up.

Execpt this time, I did not sat on the chair. I sat on the stairs. I called the commercial, who ignored me. I cannot remember whag cs said. Then I receive a call from the emmergencies. The nurse called them. Like always, they pass me the call to a doctor. 

I was still broken. She said things like ""we sent the emmergencies for you multiple times right?"".
She would not understand what I was saying.

How the fuck how I suppose to explain all of this in like 5 minutes? 

She said she would send an ambulance, and hung up, I think. I went back to my house to make another bag. 

Called the commercial, because I wanted a reason for this bs, tried to call my old psy, again, but she already left work, called a help hotline, called the commercial again, then cs for 25min. No idea what I talked about.

Noticed something strange? No ambulance.
That fucking bitch could have killed me.

So I called the nurse again so he could come back. I went to the store close to my house. To beg if they could make a contract for me. Apparently they have the materiel now, but it was close to closing and the necessary guy had left already. Apparently I finished the day with a 25min call to cs. No idea. Don't ask me.

On the 29th. 3 am. Could not sleep. Saw an email. Could not sleep anymore. They deleted my contrat for my 4g box and I had to pay 400€. At one point the net stopped working. They had deleted it. Had to wait until 6am (out of all the bs, thank god cs opens at 6) to sort this out.

So because they are incompetants, they misinspreted what I said and started the process of deleting. But I sent a ""wtf is wrong with you I never said this"" and they were like ""ah ok sorry"". But they didn't cancel the deleting.

Because the directors or whatever, I went back to the shop because maybe the guy would be there and I also forgot everything else the other guy said.
I asked ""do you make fiber contracts"" ""yes, what adress"" ""that adress"" ""na they don't have it here"" ""wwwwhat"" ""listen, I live there, I know. Let me call J. Hey J, there is this lady here, here is her number"" (this is a very dumbed down version of the conversation).

So J calls me right away and gives me an appointement for this afternoon. I'm confused, because I have no idea what his job his. 

So basically J hooked me up with the isp I was with before, because cunt company knew they didn't had access to the fiber and was going to make me turn in circles until I litteraly die.

But those cunts did it again with the ""the client said not to delete"", and the other guy was probably wearing his headphones or something.
I have a bill for 233€, the lady said not to worry about it, but I screamed at her to tell the service to make a new bill. Because, of course they fucking forgot, because they are cunts : they owe me money. I'll call again to remind them.

Like, fuck me, I wasn't going to call them again and they start their bs. 

And you know what ? My period finally stopped. Guess when.

Those motherfucking cunts almost killed me.

But to come back to the title. I have this friend I know is on steam, but he hasn't been on for a few days.

And this other friend. Holy fucking shit. I made a facebook and Instagram account to find him and contact him. But those accounts are too old.
Then I was like ""what is a popul... twitter"". I think I found him. His account is private but I saw that someone answered to him in sept 2020. 

God, I feel so empty, I just want this cunt company to die and me having what I've been fighting all along for. Fucking fiber.

And talk a little to my friends. Just a little.

So if you are insane like me and read everything : I sent the photos and kinda (really) harassed them because I want them to remember until they die that it is their fault. They made me go fucking crazy. I never harmed myself before, or took a chair as high as I could.

I have no idea if I can come back from this. 

Dude, like every time I have a real conversarion like this, nobody answers.

And the fucking keyboard on this phone, I swear to god.

And another thing that PISSES me off : the psychiatrists have appointements until like july or some shit. And psychologists are not riembursed.

Alright, bye to myself, looks like I have to wait until 6am again, if I do not see that bill fixed I'll be super stressed again."
1774,depression,What’s wrong with me?,"There are some good things are happening in my life right now and I am happy about them, but I just can’t stop feeling overall depressed and wishing I could just stop existing. I feel like I can’t talk about these bad feelings with anybody because it’ll just drive them away and I’m sure no one wants to listen to someone else be such a downer, as someone once told me. I don’t want to actively hurt myself, but sometimes I wish I could be part of some freak accident out of my control that ended my life."
1775,depression,"Everything bad that has ever happened to you is, directly or indirectly, your own fault.","Ever since I realise this sentence I've been in constant state of depression, and my life has been in content decline and failure for years now. 

Recently I've lost all motivation to work on my job or business.
I've started a big fight with my own brothers and sisters until police was involved, it was my mistake and my fault, I can't look them in the eye anymore or even consider myself part of the family again. 

I truly believe now that I'm a less being than anyone around, I'm the bad guy in my family and in my life, I'm the one who needs to be casted away.

I'm thinking of breaking up my engagement with my GF because I feel like I'm a danger to her and her future, she doesn't deserve that. 

I've developed memory problems because I've been accused many time of forgetting the things that started the problems. 

I have developed anger issues and really really dark thoughts of self hate and self damage.

I believe I'm beyond saving at this point. So I just wanted to write this down here, I don't seek help or salvation, I'm not worth that anymore.

1780,depression,"100% loser, what to do!!"," 

I'm 45 man from Egypt, software developer. 5 years ago, I met a nice lady from Lithuania (an EU country) and I moved there, married her and found a job there. Later, she divorced me and I cannot keep a job for more than a year. Three places fired me after a year in each because I was not good enough as they expected. I think I'm not good enough yes, I'm from a third world country, old and I cannot be good like young European developers.

Now, I have no family, no friends and soon I will have no job. That divorce I had was my second one and I don't want to look for another job because I will end up with the same result, being fired again. I don't want get back to Egypt either, I have no one there and there is no future in that country. I think I have no friends here because people are afraid of someone like me from the middle east.

I'm old and I have been living with my cats only for more than a year. I'm thinking about killing myself but because I'm a 100% loser, I'm extremely worried to fail and to have a permanent disability to live with. I called the suicide hotline but they kept me waiting and ended the call later.

If someone has any other choice to me, please write it down but don't give false hopes or life coaching nonsense.

Thanks"
1781,depression,Has my boyfriend stopped taking antidepressants so he can game more?,"My boyfriend used to take his antidepressant pill once a day, he told me he’s been on antidepressants since his teens (he’s now 27). However since he’s got a gaming computer he spends all of his time and energy on it. First it was weight gain (he complained about it to me, I told him I didn’t care as long as he’s happy but if he’s really worried he should just do a bit more movement like go on walks. Next was a doctors trip, his vitamin d levels are insufficient so the doctor recommended he go outside. And thirdly was the antidepressants, he hasn’t picked up a new prescription for 2 months! I keep asking him and he tells me he will but he just hasn’t. 

I’m worried he’s getting his dopamine release from staying on the computer, and he’s not even always gaming sometimes he just browsed random things on google. 

It’s getting excessive, he isn’t taking care of himself anymore, he wakes up to game (I woke up at 8am today to see that he had already started gaming) and plays until it’s time to go to sleep. 

I’m posting in the depression subreddit because if this is an issue with his mental health then I want to try to help him. 

It’s also one thing to note that when I do bring up outdoor activities he calls me controlling, when I bring up excessive computer time he says I’m using it as a scapegoat for our other problems. He deflects anything to do with the computer or going outdoors and I don’t know what to do anymore."
1782,depression,Self-mutilation,"I did it. I am not proud of it. It was not an irrational choice, it was a calculated tactic for handling depression. Although it was rational, I did not really think things through, because many months have passed since I cut myself, and yet, the scars are very visible. I stopped wearing T-shirts because of this, and I never take my shirt off if someone is near. I can't go to a pool, I can't go to the beach, because of the scars. I am afraid that someone might see them, and I will be judged. I did not think that I cut so deep as to leave visible scars.

How do you explain this to another person, if discovered? How can they understand? Mental health is a touchy subject, even taboo in some geographical areas. Is it better to keep it all in yourself, or get out there and risk being misunderstood or judged?

I stopped cutting myself a long time ago. A small victory, but still a victory.

Anyone feel me?"
1783,depression,I want to kill myself even though I am at the happiest point in my life.,"  

I have been a chronically depressed and self-harming for the past 5-6 years of my life (I can’t really remember what it feels like to be happy anymore). I just remember existing in a void of space, patiently waiting for my end. What came next, I did not expect. 

Three years ago, I used to be a teacher assistant for one of my community college classes and about 4 months ago, one of the students from that class got back to me online, we started talking, she confessed her feelings for me and now, we have been dating for almost two months. It would be a disgraceful lie to say that these past few months did not bring me the biggest joy in my life. I question every day, why someone like her would ever want to be with someone like me. She is incredibly smart, kind, patient, forgiving, and just outworldly gorgeous. When we just started talking and she confessed her feelings for me, I did my utmost best to explain to her my mental health situation, because I knew that I would end up falling for her and eventually I will become a burden for her. This is exactly what happened, unfortunately. 

I fell for her even harder that I expected. Not only because she is my first girlfriend, but also because of how much I admire her as an individual. But sometimes, this only makes things worse. Nowadays, I spend most of my days contemplating my insecurities and just being stuck in my head, imagining ridiculous scenarios of how she will eventually dump me because of myriad of reasons: my jealousy of her past, my insecurities about my personality, etc. I glob as many relationships advice videos as I can to find tips on how to handle my insecurities, my depression and suicidal thoughts, and not bother her with my mental health issues all the time, but whenever I seek her help, she is always incredibly supportive and helps me to go through my emotions. However, I feel like she is getting tired of having to comfort me all the time and assuring me of her feelings to me. 

On one hand, I am being pushed forward by my wonderful girlfriend, who I do not deserve, but who I love and care for, with all my heart. On the other hand, I am being pulled back by my past, my insecurities about her past and myself, the thoughts of making her a favor and taking my life. Some days, my love for her gets me through the day easily. Other days, I can’t stop thinking about ending it all for her sake, because I don’t want to hold her down as an individual. 

Today, I was driving on a highway and for no reason, I went to a left lane and sped up to 85 mph. For a second, I was hoping I would get crashed and die in an accident, but then quickly regrouped myself mentally. 

I am sorry for long post, but I just needed a space to share."
1784,depression,part of me wishes i didnt have friends so i would stop comparing myself to them,"they have family that cares and understands them, they live in a developed country where all their needs are met, they are happy with what they have, they are not suffering from an illness. i envy them so much because they have it so much better than me. i just wish i wasnt born to an abusive parents in a third world country where its impossible for me to get proper healthcare."
1785,depression,Life,I've gotten to the point where I don't know what to feel anymore which is mostly psychologically.. over the years I feel that I've numbed even more than I used to be. I have no interest in almost everything but somehow still manage to force myself to do things. I suppose this is more of a desire than motivation. I still struggle to not reject any form of happiness. It's really scary out there and nobody can prepare you for it. All you can really do is learn and try your best to not repeat the same mistakes.

I mean it’s an achievement to have your own place and your own car but even then, I know loads of people on good wages who don’t even own their own car or house - and then I’ve had douchebag managers who can just reject your holiday requests... the weather is hotting up in the UK recently and I just wanna enjoy the sun and eat and drink.

1789,depression,Lurking thoughts,"I am doing really really well mentally and emotionally, but I still get lingering thoughts that tell me I'm not good enough. I have two jobs, and work in a school so I am very cautious of what I do and wear when at work. I enjoy my jobs and love working at a school to support students, but I don't ever really feel real joy. I don't feel EXCITED about anything. I used to love holidays and especially my birthday, but my birthday is coming up and I just feel numb to it. I'm just getting older and more helpless tbh. 

Anyway, point is, I think a worker saw some scars at the school a few months ago but she never said anything about it and I pretend to be oblivious to her shocked look for a second. We both played it off well. And that should have made me think, maybe if I'm working somewhere like here, I should stop. Maybe I should re think hurting myself just because I am doing SO WELL. I've been praised at work and at home, but I have so many issues deep down that stress me out and my only release is causing more harm to my skin. I feel much better when I hurt myself, like I've just done something that flicks a switch and I can relax. And when I don't do it, I get more stressed and tense. I hate it but I don't know what to do anymore.

 I know I should stop for my job, the students I see at work that look up to me, and my fellow employees, but I just can't stop it and I hate myself for being so selfish."

im constantly put in a position where i have to choose between the two of them. my parent doesn’t like me around this sibling, even though we’re all adults. 

i dont know who i could even ask for advice or help as the many times i did try, i never really got any help. i couldn’t figure out why i couldn’t just have both. 

at this point on my life, with having depression &amp; anxiety since i was in middle school, i’ve given up seeking help and i just feel like i’m useless. im so confused for so many reasons and i cant figure anything out.

1803,depression,Why won't I do anything?,"I've had crippling anxiety and depression all my life. When I was 19 I got sick of playing video games all day, being overweight, watching TV till 5am, waking up at 3pm and doing it all over again. I changed my life then, slept at proper times, worked out everyday, worked hard on my own career. 

Fast forward to present day me at 26 years old. Just got out of a 3 year long relationship with who I thought was my soul mate. We built a highly successful brand together and have a nice house, cars, bags etc. It took me 5 long years to get to this point, working on myself, taking risks and being grateful for everyday.

But a year ago, I think I got too comfortable? or I just stopped loving myself. I lost that edge, I reverted back to my old self. My bf hated me for who I ""really"" was and dumped me. It's been almost 6 months since then and I still can't push myself to lift a finger to even wake up in the morning. I'm crippled by the anxiety and just avoid everything, my business is dying and I'm staring bankruptcy in the face - yet I still don't do anything. Just lay at home all day.

It took me a while to get over my ex, but now that I've mostly stopped thinking about it, it's like I have nothing left to think of except how empty my life is. My mindset is that I just feel like I can't be bothered to do anything. I can't be bothered to go gym, fix my lifestyle or to even work. Everytime I get a thought, I just think how much easier it would be to just kill myself and laze around all day. Existence feels so exhausting to me, I just want to do nothing, I just feel empty.

As a teen, any time my mother would see cuts on my body, she would curse at me, call me a psychopath and would accuse me of trying to make her “look like a bad parent.” It was even worse when I would try to express my suicidal feelings; I would get yelled at for being “ungrateful” and for stressing her out. 

 Nothing has changed even now that I’m an adult. If I bring up any suicidal feelings, I get yelled at and called names, and accused of just wanting attention.  I also have to be very diligent about hiding my self-harm scars so I don’t anger her, or cause another argument. Fortunately, I have a wonderful therapist and psychiatrist, so I am able to receive help for these problems. 

Sorry for the rant, I just don’t understand why my problems with depression piss my mother off to such a degree."

1823,depression,I thought I was getting better on my new medication but I went back to being hopeless tonight,I’m trying to face the reality that this feeling will never go away. I just wish I could be normal.

I know I need help but I don’t want meds or therapy. I don’t want anyone to know what’s going on, while at the same time all I want is for someone to understand."
1825,depression,I complain about some issues,"I had posted another post on here, and I don't know how to edit that one so I'm making another one to put more of my thoughts about my life and rant a lot. Please ignore everything if you want. 

I think the biggest main issue in my life right now is my mom. I know, stereotypical dumbass teen complains about his mother. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you. I don't actually know what that means, but it felt right to say it. 

I've been given a lot of things by my mom so I should probably shut up and be her slave and do everything I am told already. But I just can't help my think about how much of a pain being in her presence is. I guess I'll start low and work my way up about all the things that she does that makes me feel irritated. 

I don't like how she talks. I mean the tone and manner. It just sounds very fake and insincere. I'd rather her talk slower and quieter. Every time I heard a high pitch sound I always think about my mom. I don't know why, but I am kind of scared of her voice. Maybe if I had to guess, it's because she would always talk about everything I am not very good at and tell me a lot of other things which are probably helpful. I would always focus on when she says my faults because it feels weird hearing someone say that. 

I'd wish she stop talking about my grades. I used to think I was smart until I realized I wasn't, but I think she still wants me to be smart or something. She makes me think grades are very important and a lot of other things which is probably true, but I can't help but feel like she looks down on me. She probably does. One thing I remember her saying very well was that I was a loser. She's probably right but I just don't like when she said that. I think I made this and that other thread today because I was just shown my grade of 89% in a class my mom thought I was good at. Then, I was berated(is that the right word?) and she does what she normally does. 

I don't like it when she acts nice to me. For years, she's been acting nice, then arguing with me. It  makes me cry a lot when she does that so I want her to stop it. So can she just stop being nice to me? I hate it when she compliments me because I feel like it was fake and only there because she felt obligated to do it. 

I feel like blaming everything on her. I always felt bad at things probably because I was/am. But I just want to blame her for it, for always working so late and coming home in the mornings. For not letting me go to the high school all my friends went to and letting go to a new school where I am picked on. I always felt like it was her fault. But I also blame everything on her so I don't have to blame myself. I think I secretly know every bad thing that happened to me was my fault. i think I don't want that to be true. But I think it is becoming true. 

I take back what I said in the beginning of this rant. The main issue I have is myself. And I think I am a very small person for blaming it on others. I was the one who I look down on. i want to stand there and laugh at myself. There's a lot of problems that I could of solved if I was smarter and tried being smarter. 

I guess the only solution to for me to either get smarter or something. I don't really have any motivation to do it. I just want to sleep and do it someday when I feel better. I don't really feel any smarter than I was two or three years ago. I felt just as clueless and I felt like I could be smarter in the future. I don't really know why I haven't just said my problems already, then people would reply solutions or something, I don't know how this site works. 

I always feel like I am very weak. I can't really run well. And I sweat easily. I don't think I am good at any physical activity. When I get the courage to go outside, I always stop and look in the mirror, then decide not to go outside. Then when I try and do something at home, I always feel like my mom will come home and I don't want her to see me as pathetic or something even though she probably does. I guess I tried exercising in my room, but I always just want to find an excuse for me to not do anything so I don't. 

I hate that I am very lazy. I can never study. I can never exercise. Everytime I am home I just want to sleep. I just feel very tired when I am home. I am supposed to go with a friend to a restaurant this Monday but I want to just say no because I don't want him to look at me and see how nothing about me really improved. 

I don't really know why I am complaining so much. I don't want the internet to say that I am a bitch or coward or anything like that but I don't want to include some things I don't want to think about. I actually kinda hope no one sees this so they don't comment on how much of a coward I am. Even though I know this, I still wanted to write this and just see if I really am a bad person or that I am a fine person and I was just overreacting. I feel very bad about writing this much for someone to read. I can't really read that well so I would probably hate whoever made this.  Now that I think about it. I really don't want anyone to read this. Compared to other things in this reddit, my situation is probably very good and I probably sound like a whining spoiled child who made a whole essay because he was sad.  I really want to erase this now and continue to do nothing. I'll probably erase this."
1826,depression,I've determined that my depression tends to fluctuate between four modes.,"1. Oh well.
2. Why?
3. Agony.
4. Fuck you, I can eat whatever the hell I want at 2:34 AM, I'm not using this vile chunk of meat and bone for anything important.

The fourth one's kind of fun sometimes, empowering even. The third one's the worst, though. I'm horrified that existence will go on in wake of this moment. Sometimes I'm scared to sleep knowing that I'll wake up."
1827,depression,Always had relationship problems,"I’ve never been in a romantic relationship with anybody.  I’ve come close to being in relationships but one of three things always happens: (1) I either mess it up by not acting fast enough because I’m too scared to make a move, or I’m just too stupid to realize the girl’s into me, or (2) the girl I like just doesn’t like me back, or (3) something completely out of our control stops us from starting anything meaningful.  The third happens way too much and is always soul crushing.  Whenever the stars align and a girl and I end up having some real chemistry, life always ends up getting in the way.  Twice I’ve been talking to a girl, I like her and she clearly likes me, but then she goes to one school and I go to another before anything has time to develop.  Or the summer goes by and we never have a class together ever again.  Or one girl outright moved out of the state before I could do anything.  It sucks so hard.  And whenever I’m the one to mess it up, I just end up hating myself.  I’ve been alone for my whole life and I’m sick of it.  My friends all have girlfriends and I look at their relationships and wish I had what they had.  Or I see them having problems and think that I could do so much better as a boyfriend.  I don’t know, maybe I’m just weird, or ugly.  Or both."
1828,depression,"Another year, no progress.","I turn a year older soon. I still find myself entrapped in this cycle of self-abuse that I seem to love so much. I don’t know how long it’s been since I’ve lifted a finger to do anything meaningful, to do any work, to create anything that wasn’t absolute garbage. I have all this privilege, all this time to waste, and I throw it all away, in the faces of those who support me despite my shitty attitude. It’s on me to make change, but I’m my own worst enemy. I suspect my wonderful therapist wants to give up on treatment, because I’ve just lulled in progress, quit my job and started living like a spoilt hermit since I started. I’m just a total waste of space, I’m not one of those people who can’t see their worth. That’s the scary thing, I know my worth, and it’s jack shit. Sorry I think I just needed to vent. Living is so tiring for me rn."
1829,depression,just something to vent about,"this is the only way for me to vent since everybody I talked to calls me a downer or gate keeps me, even though i ask them if i could vent to them. no body cares that I have depression and i don't wanna pay someone to listen to me and every time i wanna say something I just shut up and stay quiet since i always tell myself who cares and I'm asking for pity, I just wish I had someone to talk with. i cant sleep and I'm on the verge of losing my job because of my self destructive habits. (I don't do drugs btw) i have no motivation and I've tried to get into something so I don't have to listen to myself asking who am I ? or what am I ? I'm not suicidal but sometimes I see something sharp and i just imagine harming my self with it or just wishing i would get beaten to a pulp just to feel something. it get hard sometimes keeping up with lies i make for me to feel more important than what i really am. i try to be happy but i just cant keep up with it. its hard for me to type this rn because i just know no one would care, I've excepted that. I've been in a mental hospital after a failed suicide attempt and honestly it was the worst mistake of my life cause now my parents see me differently and every time I have an idea and tell them they make it seem like i wanna kill my self again, it makes me hate my parents. the feeling of just sitting for hours without any stimulation just makes me go mad with insanity, just thoughts rushing in and out not knowing how to make it stop and just trying to find a YouTube video or going for a walk or a drive and it not doing anything. i get bad headaches and body aches just from doing nothing. it sucks. I know I sound like a broken record but I'm just getting all of this off my chest. thank you to those who cared enough to read this. it help a little know at least someone is listening"

They’re getting the vaccines out to the wrong people, and they’ve handled this whole pandemic horribly. 

On top of that, there are anti-maskers protests. There are people who are eligible to get vaccinated and who won’t. It’s so hard to get out of this depressive state when I can’t control the things others do or say especially when these things affect me directly.

1838,depression,Working theory is I'm brain-damaged.,"Just some thoughts before I absolutely must put myself to bed.

I wonder if ADHD/Anxiety/depression have changed the way my brain works to an extent I didn't even know was possible.  Effectively, I must be by definition, ""brain damaged"".

I made a few response posts to various threads, trying to convey the totality of my thoughts triggered by those respective threads, and I realized I communicate like someone who has Aspergers, which I am not saying flippantly.  It's just, I grew up in an environment of constant abuse, where we were constantly misunderstanding and gaslighting one another, particularly my dad.  Even us being good to one another was having five hour back porch, musing about life kind of talks.  

My mom is a much, much simpler person.  I always resented her for being kinda dumb. She has like a 7th grade education and is from a literal island. But I've come to a certain awareness that growing up in a constant trauma state has probably affected me so deeply, that ""broken"" might be a pretty apt descriptor.

Even loving who I am, I have also been confronted recently with the idea that just because I learned to love and value myself, doesn't mean I stopped hating myself.  I wouldn't have ever thought those two things could coexist, and yet here I am, feeling how I feel.

I have been fighting so hard as of late.  Fighting to not lose my self love and worth being on top, and I'm losing.

I can barely focus, I sure as shit haven't been sleeping.  And in its most recent example, I realized people must think I'm word-vomiting to sound smart, or feel superior.  Like, no, this nonsense is how my brain works.  I'm lucky I get anything remotely right, so when I feel assured my thinking is sound, I want to express the totality of my thoughts so you know exactly how I got there.  Yeah, it might be a jigsaw puzzle, but I recall lots of conversations when I did have friends in my twenties that were substantive and also all over the place simultaneously.

Is it really all that foreign and burdensome for people to have to work a little harder to understand?  I spend an enormous amount of energy having to check my internal logic, and even then I am forced to be humble and open because there's always a chance I took a hardline stance on a range of issues and got it wrong, or unintentionally hurt someone.  ""Normal"" people have zero interest in putting that much effort into checking their biases, and it's downright insulting.

Yeah, I sermonize, I respond in both text and RL with a river of consciousness.

Ugh... it only draws me back to the idea that I absolutely can't be on this planet for many more years and decades.  If I'm so... unpalatable, weak, stupid, warped, and worst of all, completely alone, then what the fuck am I doing here?  Meditating?  Achieving small dreams like being a functional, whole person, or being clever enough to free myself from class chains? I am no martyr, I have had so many people leave me for valid reasons, even people I would have done literally anything for. But why am I trying so hard to carry myself with dignity and compassion, only to be too soft and dysfunctional to know how other people see me?

I'm so afraid.  Not in any way that matters tonight, but I am losing, and I'm afraid. I'm hurt and alone, and with the exception of a few spread out years, and a few handfuls of people I have cared about, I always have been.  And I am pretty sure it broke me and my brain in a way that can't be helped.

I'm so afraid that the truth is, I have struggled 24/7/365 nearly my entire life to get here, at this point in my healing, and it's all for nothing. I used to tell the story too often, but I remember where I was when I felt something in my universe change.  And because a truth like that, would be pretty iron clad, I wouldn't have much to fight ""brain damaged"" from trauma and physical injuries and a shit family and isolation and, and, and...

The question is loud in my thoughts lately, ""what if I'm fooling myself holding on so desperately to hope?"" The hope that one day I would have a full, healthy, connected life.  That I'd be free from my inherited class status, that all the people I've hurt intentionally and unintentionally, all the people who've hurt or left me... that'd I was smart enough and strong enough to outlast and dismantle all these things, and that there would be something worthwhile on the other side.  It was real hope that this could all be done.

I just can't stop hearing it now, ""what if hope is a lie?"""
1839,depression,(Seeking advice) Partner with depression unable to motivate or take care of themselves,"Throwaway account **

My partner who I live with and love dearly is struggling with depression and motivation (diagnosed ~10years ago). This has been a tough year made tougher by their shitty work situation. Between September and November things really became unbearable for them and they reached their mental breaking point. December on they have been unable to be self sufficient or find motivation for anything. They sleep 16 or more hours a day, spend most waking hours in bed or laying on couch, cannot make their own food, cannot clean up after themselves, cannot do laundry, need help with tasks like getting them things out of arms reach or going to the corner store for them or taking care of their pet etc. I do not have a problem with doing favors for the people you care about, but I mention this because its an excessive amount of requests, 20-30 tasks a day. And if I say no, it is met with anger that I am “making” them do it themselves or they won’t do it at all.

Maybe most concerning is their coping with alcohol and marijuana. Drinking every day of the week and starting to drink around noon some days (work days). Smoking til they fall asleep mid work day as well, asking me to wake them if they receive a message from anyone on their work computer.

I can’t tell if I’m helping by doing the things they can’t motivate themselves to do or ask of me while they heal, or if I’m making things much much worse by making them more codependent and comfortable in inactivity. Im finding it difficult to approach a conversation addressing the above as their natural defense mechanism to conflict (self described) is to become upset/ashamed to have this pointed or saying things like “please don’t be upset/mad/sad/annoyed with me” to end the conversation. I am human and sometimes my own emotions may taint the delivery of my concerns, but I honestly try very hard to check my emotions at the door when addressing a sensitive and personal conversation like that. 

 I’m coming here seeking advice and perspective. As time moves forward, the codependency and inactivity grows. They are aware of it too and speak about it by their own volition frequently. They have been trying virtual counseling/therapy but haven’t been able to really connect with anyone yet (and have rescheduled most of the sessions since signing up). They also take anti depressant medication, which they stopped taking for a few years but began again in January. They frequently say they do not feel any affect or that they are helping at all. They desperately want to break from their funk but cannot seem to do so.

Please help us with any strategies or advice you may have."
1840,depression,I’m Depressed,"And there’s no way around it. I’ve felt this way for a long time. It’s destroyed my friendships by slowly wearing away at each one, and all I’ve been capable of doing has been to emanate negativity and self hatred. My current friends seem to understand whenever I muster the courage to answer their “what’s up? Why are you so quiet now? Are you doin okay”s with simple explanations that I’m just depressed and get sad at random times. I want to be able to do better, and “match their wavelength” or whatever, and be able to discuss things with them. The problem is, I don’t have anything to talk about. I haven’t dedicated myself to anything at all at this point in my life (22, turning 23 soon), with the exception of the Zelda series and to listening to and learning some songs by incredibly niche bands. Not discounting the credibility of those bands and their music, but none of that exactly gives me a leg up in society. Someone might think that dedicating yourself to getting good grades in school and earning an Eagle Scout would help with that immensely, but instead I chose to become an English major and get a stupid English degree with my parents’ hard earned money. At the time I really thought I could find a pathway to a career that way, but as the time grows between the present and my graduation, the cold realization that I will never find anything that I can dedicate myself to (and be recognized by others as enough of authority on that subject to get a job) and the fact that I did not do enough sinks deep and seizes every muscle in my body. It’s hard for me to want to do anything at all, at this point, especially realizing how little I actually have to my name in terms of skills (or even money, for that matter). A good friend of mine introduced me to a whole bunch of music that I’d never listened to before and know I should be excited by, but it’s hard to find the time to listen to it. Plus a lot of it is oldish... but that’s usually not a problem for me, and I love 90s music, so it really shouldn’t be a problem. But everything is just so blah and whatever now. It’s all coated in a thick layer of SAD and the days blur together like a watercolor painting being rained on. Happy music doesn’t resonate with me and sad music just pulls me closer to my sadness. Angry music just deepens my resentment for the world and for my existence in general. It’s like everything that once gave me purpose is suddenly exacerbating everything bad about me and making me feel terrible. I’m inadequate. I have no self confidence and I never had it. Any confidence I ever had was given to me by friends and family, especially lovers though. I’m trying desperately to figure out how to get real confidence and how to discipline myself in a field like playing music to the point where I have the confidence to play in front of others again. Covid destroyed me and whatever semblance of self-love I had prior. Now I just smile like a dumbass whenever I’m around people and say nothing. I feel incredibly stupid constantly. Nothing connects for me. The world is a mess of chaos and disorder that I cannot keep up with. I’m trying to practice meditation as well, and have become intrigued by some Buddhist philosophies and meditative states to improve the well-being of mind, but I don’t know if this will help me be more social. I know I can say anything in front of my friends, but I don’t know what to say to them, if that makes sense. When people talk, a lot of their words go right over my head and keeping up with conversation is tragically difficult. So I can’t respond, and I’m left either nodding “yes” or “no” or laughing or sighing at what they say. It feels moronic. They give me time to respond, and I’m always leaving that time an awkward silence. It’s been impossible for me to overcome. Nothing going through my brain is relevant enough to respond properly. It’s either too dark (in terms of me hating myself) or just too “out there”. Am I not built for people? Even though I’ve spent my whole life believing (and being told by my introverted family) that I am a people person and built my life so far around the social, like music, literature, and leadership? It just feels so stupid to me now. I feel incredibly discouraged. I’ve had a nasty couple of years all through my entire college experience. I was dumped by my first (and only) long-term girlfriend, proceeded by my staying friends with her and her friends (which was ungodly bad for my mental health, but I just didn’t want to hurt anybody’s feelings), then the realization that engineering would kill me caused me to switch to English, proceeded further by the discovery that a “good” friend of mine and room mate was doing horrible shit to me behind my back, and finished off with a year of fruitless job searches in a covid wasteland. It hasn’t been all terrible as I also spent a good portion of 2020 in a casual relationship, which was fun but not at all a healthy relationship or a constructive one. I never got a real loose college party experience. I’ve never been able to find a real and stable path to being a funny, or at least entertaining, person in social situations and all that stuff just made it infinitely worse. People still teach at me, saying I just need to do this or that or think some way in order to overcome this, but I just don’t see how I can do that. I tried meds for a while but they made me zombie-like. I would still get sad but be unable to cry, if that makes sense. I’m just the least fun person trying to make it in a world where fun dominates. It’s just fucking stupid and I belong in a basement, typing up reports and documents and boring ass sad shit because that’s what I am. People say they like me but I’ve realized it’s just because I always agree with them, and since others notice this in me too, they exploit it (these are good friends I have now, they only choose to exploit it in minor ways to teach me not to do it), and I can’t help but realize what a human punching bag I am. I know I need more confidence and I need to know more about stuff in general, but honestly so little attracts my attention. I have to really dig to find anything that even remotely catches my eye. I’ve held a resentment for being born since early childhood. A lot of it comes from the way my parents treated myself and my siblings when we were young, but as someone who’s made it this far, I really just want to find a job and create some stability for myself in making a home somewhere. Then I feel like I’ll be a full human being. But I also realize that if I’m not happy now, then there’s a slim chance that I can ever be happy. More hardships are sure to come, and good times have felt so few and far between for such a long time now. So what is there to look forward to? How can I possibly escape this life of obscene mediocrity that I’ve chosen for myself? Why have I been such a dumbass and never invested myself in anything beyond zelda and some specific genres of music and even more specific bands within those genres? I’ve had such few passions and I’ve seen each one of them burn before my eyes as I let the world rip them away from me. My scope of understanding is so small and irrelevant, I’m nothing but a bum waiting to be put out on the streets.. I’ve experimented with drugs and honestly I just want as many opioids as I can get my hands on, I want to obliterate this pain and I’m starting to not care how I do it. If it’s not opioids then it’s gonna be alcohol. It’s been weed for a long while now, but weed’s shown me nothing and plagued me with more anxiety and harmfully invasive introspection. I’m just a sad empty-headed twat with nothing good to say. Look at all this worthless self-pity, all grammatically correct and everything. It’s atrocious and I’m an abomination. It would be wonderful if I could just blow my brains out, but I know how much pain it would cause those around me, so I guess that escape isn’t an option. But it SUCKS. Because suicide is my brain’s go-to. IT FUCKING SUCKS AND I HATE IT. I HATE THIS LIFE IT’S BEYOND NOT WORTH LIVING IF I CAN’T EVEN FUCKING SPEAK FOR MYSELF.  I don’t get pop culture references and I’ve always found sports excruciatingly boring. I’m not into much of anything. My world is pretty damn empty, so most of what I say has no direction, like picking up sand only to scatter it on the wind of my breath. It’s such a mess it’s not even funny. Literally because nobody knows what I’m going for when I try to say anything. It’s just so hard to put my energy into positive things... it all seems so pointless to me... and that’s the extent of my personality... just sad..."

1842,depression,why are the bad days just getting worse?,"i have no motivation to do shit, even answer the few friends i still have.

maybe thats for the best, couple weeks ago the person i considered my best friend basically told me to kill myself, maybe he just couldn't handle dealing with me anymore. id always apologize for making him deal with my negative bullshit and he used to send a smiley and say it was fine, he wanted to help...i guess i made him reach his breaking point with me then. who the fuck would be able to deal with a negative piece of shit like me for long?

logically i know im just making myself worse by isolating myself, but honestly i just feel so guilty whenever i do answer. its like im contaminating them with my negativity and depressing bullshit. i already ruined one person, id hate to do that to the rest.

every day just keeps getting grayer and grayer, tho...i find myself looking forward to nighttime so i can sleep and forget reality, and when im awake im consuming media so i can forget reality. a cycle of escapism no matter where i look, i can't enjoy reality at all. i wish i had something real to actually enjoy doing, something in this reality that i enjoy at all, but I don't have that.

in conclusion,

1843,depression,Mother passed away today,"  

Today this morning my mother passed away and it's extremely painful. I can't stop crying and it's hard to keep myself together. She was diagnosed with colon cancer stage 4 January of 2020. On top of this she had diabetes and eye problems. I had known this was coming. I could see my mother gradually getting weaker. I'm very depressed and I just felt like I didn't get a chance to say I love her and wish I had been there more for her. I wanted to be able to talk with her one last time and say goodbye to her, but it just happened so suddenly. I can't stop thinking of the times I had with her and I just keep crying when I think of them. I feel like my brain and mind is shattered into pieces. I just wish thus was a dream and it feels like it, but it's not. I miss her so much.   


I feel like i'm starting to have depression symptoms. Ever since COVID started, thats when my mom had gotten sick. With both of those going on at the same time I just felt like the depression just seemed to be gradually progressing, at this moment I feel like its at its peak and I don't know what kind of help should I seek. I see my therapist regularly, I'm bumping it up to once a week now instead of every other week. I have a psychiatrist and I do have bipolar disorder, I don't have bipolar depression but its bipolar/manic disorder, but I know for people with bipolar situations like this are much harder to handle and deal with, I can't really handle it well and I legit can't stop crying. The medications i'm on are Seroquel and lithium, I know seroquel has antidepressant properties, but antidepressants are a last resort for now.   


Please, if anyone has been in the same shoes what kind of help and treatment should I get so that this depression that I have lingering doesn't get worse, i'm thinking of seeing a grieving counselor as well as seeing my therapist so maybe both on a weekly basis or something, unless my therapist offers that kind of services so I can go that route and see where that leads. I thank you all for your support, God bless all of you and I  hope whatever battles you are all facing you can overcome."

1845,depression,Feeling deja vu,"I haven’t cut myself in 4 years. However a year and a half ago I had a failed suicide attempt in my dorm room at college. The attempt came from 3 months of hard depressive thoughts and feelings. I just said fuck it and went for it. There was stuff going on in my life that triggered this response from me obviously, however I went through the same situation the other day and I can’t stop thinking about doing harming myself. I know I ultimately won’t at the end of the day but it sucks because I made so much progress and I feel so hurt right now."
1846,depression,I'm loosing my grip with reality,"First and foremost, I don't usually do any type of social media posts so if its a little off of what you are used to seing, I apologize. I don't wanna seem too much like a sob story either I just wanna get some stuff off my chest. Recently life has become hell for me, I live completely alone most of the time and have become really depressed. I've always had notions that life isn't real but I can't shake the idea as easily anymore. I am hallucinating more and more and constantly want to kill myself but I won't because I know it will hurt my friends and family. I keep cutting off connections with friends and acquaintances because I can't hide this stuff anymore. 

A year or two ago I started seeing and hearing things especially after I would do drugs. I've stopped the drugs and alcohol but I keep experiencing the hallucinations and focusing on them. Occasionally I feel really foggy  and it feels like the world isn't real. That's when I get really suicidal and it is a living hell. I had an encounter with a girl in my building who I thought was taking pictures of me and I started getting mad at her. When I realized it was a hallucination she looled completely terrified and wont look at me anymore. I feel unreal and this and COVID has really turned my life into a complete shitfest. 

I scheduled a consulting with one of the therapists at my college but my parents told me to work on it myself (as I use their insurance) which I know they are trying to help but they just don't get what its like. 

I don't wanna believe it's a mental illness because I know I can fix it, especially since covid is starting to go away. I'm just feeling really poopy right now and need some words of encouragement, thanks for coming to my ted-talk. (I tried to end it not so morbidly lol). If you read this, thanks. I love you.

1848,depression,I am so useless but I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself ccccc:,"Maybe this is one of my late night moods again but whatever I need to vent and Reddit is downloaded. But anyways, I feel so fucking useless. I'm talentless, I can't socialize properly, I have a horrible personality, I'm ugly, and I'm genuinely an asshole. I literally slapped my ballsack on the EVERY SINGLE BULLSHIT BRANCH of horribleness while swimming in my mother's vagina. Literally how the fuck was I the fastest sperm?????

My personality is most comparable to that one person in your friend group that no one likes but somehow, through the power of Jesus Christ himself, they always seem to hang around. Kinda like a cockroach infestation that even pest control can't get rid of. Das me, hello! I'm here and I come prepackaged with a gigaton of self loathing.

I would kill 110% kill myself, but apparently, I have been blessed by the power 10,000 little bitch boys and therefore, I am a coward. C:"
1849,depression,"I don’t have a lot of regrets, but this one haunts me.","I was 11 years old when my mom passed away. She was in and out of the hospital fighting lymphoma. She was never happy either and in constant pain for as far back as I can remember. Once she had her official diagnosis it was seldom that I ever saw her smile, and only cry. 

A few years later after being diagnosed, she was told that she has about a month to live, so my grandparents took me to visit her in the hospital. It was the first time I had seen her in 2 weeks, and we only stay for about an hour and the next thing I know I’m being taken home in the back of my grandpas car, clueless to what’s really happening to my mom. Skip ahead, and it’s the night of her passing. She only has a short time to live, and I’m told that I should come see her cause it will be my last time. I’m terrified and I refuse to go, and just the thought of seeing her made me extremely anxious. In that very moment, it was like reality struck me very hard and everything seemed clear, and despite my grandparents trying to protect me from the truth of what was happening to my mother, I knew exactly what was going on. And so, there I was at home alone by myself, and I remember wishing that I could reverse time. 

I am 24 now and the night my mom passed away haunts me. At the time, I was more scared of seeing her pass away in front of me, and I wish I had seen her or at least let her know I love her just by being there. I can’t help but feel terrible thinking how she must’ve felt when her only son didn’t come to see her when she needed me the most. I’ve been trying to overcome this for a while now, nothing works. I feel like I’ll carry this weight on my shoulders for the rest of my life, and for a good reason too, I kind of fucked up bad."
1850,depression,When you are becoming depressed do you also get these kinds of memories?,"I have reoccurring depression. When I am entering depression, early phases, my brain finds these weird ass meaningless memories in which I was a failure, worthless, stupid, ect. I am bombarded by these different memories out of nowhere for about a week until the depression becomes worse. Then it becomes a blank nothingness.

Example, on a basic ass day, at work in the teacher lounge I said something kind of argumentative about someone's mlm. This made me feel stupid. This happened probably 4 years ago. I haven't thought about for 4 fucking years, at the night that it happened. It wasn't super argumentative, they said 'oh' and we went about our days.

Or memories of when I did something stupid in high-school, or failed at something. Sometimes even stupid things I did as a preteen.

These memories are always really old, something I never really thought about much. But I remeber them and feel awful about myself.

The thing that really gets me is I have a lot memory loss from ect and I have difficulty remebering what happened the previous day. But the stupid shit I did at 13 is there to haunt me."

1853,depression,I get jealous over friends receiving love and support,I dont receive any love and I dont have access to support or help. When I see friends with supportive and loving families and a healthy mental state for the most part getting counseling I get jealous and it puts me in a toxic mindset. I shut myself down to avoid being toxic but I cant stop the feelings of jealousy. I see others getting what I wish I could have and it messes me up and forces me to be selfish and focus on my own feelings the most.

1855,depression,When depression is making me want to kill myself I think of this stupid thing,"I've had depression since I was sixteen(28 now) and every now and then(literally every day) my depression tries to talk me into killing myself by any means possible. In the past it's almost won. Fuck that though, if this illness wants me dead so badly  it's gonna have to form a fucking tumor or something because I'm not doing its dirty work. I know living is hard lots of the time, but try to stay strong guys.

1856,depression,I want to go home (vent),It feels like I’ve been fighting for a life time. I always get anxiety when watching movies anime or playing games where you have to overcome something. I feel I’ve spent my entire life overcoming and overcoming and overcoming. What’s the point? All I want to do is go home. I’m completely drained. I don’t want challenge. It especially drains me when looking at a anime where they have to overcome a big challenge and the path to that isn’t linear. If it’s linear like a dark souls game at the very least I have a route to take. But if there’s multiple paths filled with bumps and uncertainty I get annoyed. I’ve been struggling for so long so fucking long... i don’t want to keep struggling I want to go home. You tease me make me feel you inside me and I feel the love the short moments of happiness. The journey fighting to go back has been so long and I’m tired now. But I can’t accept defeat because it would ruin me. I feel like I’m trying to change a crowd of peoples minds and they are so stubborn and even though I know for a fact I’m right the only thing to do is scream and shoot myself in the head to escape. But I can’t do that. So I’m just forced there to stare off into the void. Left to repeat over and over again... I want to go home I want to go home... I’m so confused.

1858,depression,My life has been a failure,"I suck at my career which I've been doing for like a decade now and I've never accomplished anything meaningful with it. I've never been great, I'm always 3 steps behind everyone else and I don't know if I can hack it. I can't hack it at my current job and I'm gonna fail just like I always have. I have nothing to show for my work, because my peak is mediocrity veiled with a defensive coating of arrogance.

I can't relate to anyone or make meaningful relationships with people. I'm always fucking alone and I closet my emotions from everyone else by just saying ""I'm fine"" or shying the conversation away with some joke. I can't connect with anyone. I'm a recluse who won't ever be with anyone, even as a friend. 

I don't have any talents, I can't connect with people, I'm not productive, I can barely take care of myself, and I fuck up a lot. I've fucked up my life. I don't know how not to fuck up at this point."
1859,depression,Fuck it I’m getting hammered,"Long story short I told my best friend I love her. I’ve been in love with her for four years and I’ve told her before but she didn’t feel the same at that time. This time I still don’t know how she feels.

She also inadvertently made me feel bad for not making a move in four years but I feel like I’ve tried so many times and nothing. 

I feel like we’re codependent with eachother and I lowkey hate it. I hate feeling absolutely awful and depressed whenever I tell her how I feel.

Like wtf do I even do at this point. If I cut her off I’ll be way more depressed and drink wayy more like I used to. But if i stay her friend I’ll still be depressed because I really do love her and it’s not reciprocated as far as I know.

I have always struggled with depression but I just can't deal with it anymore. I'm mad all the time. Little things set me off an I feel like a ticking time bomb. I'm tired of the ER visits an medical debt because I am not taking care of myself. I'm tired of things never working out. I'm not happy and I'm miserable to be around. Debating leaving my husband so he can be happy. He doesn't deserve this an neither does my child. They both deserve a loving mother an wife but instead they are stuck with me.

1870,depression,I can’t stand the thought of getting a career,"I don’t understand how people just accept their fates. I acknowledge that I am pretty lazy and I have a lot of things that I need to do, but I don’t understand how people can just go and have careers.

I don’t get how anyone can be “career oriented”. It seems that at a certain point people just let their souls die. Once you finish college, or even highschool in some cases, it’s like you’re signing the rest of your life away to be a wage-slave.

How can anyone say “just do what you’re passionate about”. There’s nothing I am passionate enough to give away all of my free time to. I don’t know how I will wake up at 7 am every morning, get home at 5 with the whole day gone and then to bed at 10pm because I’ll be old and tired. My whole life spent wasting away for a wage.

Am I missing something? I don’t see how people think it’s acceptable that this is the path humans take. You grow up and then slave away

Some people get lucky and are genetically blessed and can be actors or athletes while us peasants toil around.

I don’t see how you aren’t dead once your career starts.

My ideal career is something that is monotonous and at least doesn’t stress me out. It’s horrible enough that I will spend most of my life slaving away, at least don’t make it give me sleepless nights as well.

Then my life will just pass by thanks to my shitty career. What a great life. I don’t understand how or why people do it. I don’t see how I will do it. Life just seems like a complete slog. I just want to stay in and relax and do my own thing, but I’ll instead have to submit to some boss, submit to an awful sleep schedule and have no hope of any work life balance. I don’t see how I will live many years of that."
1871,depression,Why am I even here? I should be dead already,"Why do I feel like I'm a complete failure? Probably because everytime I start something I never end up finishing it. Maybe it's because every social interaction makes me insecure. Or maybe it's because no one sees me as a normal person anymore. Maybe it's because of all of this. I just can't feel like myself anymore. I don't talk to anyone anymore, I don't eat, I don't sleep and I don't act like I used to. I can't even feel hapiness. I'm just so lost these past weeks, I can't find who I am. I wish things would get better. Isn't it what they all say? ""Things will get better"" How the fuck are you suppose to know if it will truly get better? From what I know it's only been going downhill for the past year. What’s the point in fighting for a happy ever after if the past keeps haunting the future? I tried everything, every single thing that people told me to do to feel better. I just can't get back to who I used to be, someone normal. I started to cut, drink and smoke. I don't even know why I do it, I guess it makes me feel better. I don't really know. I feel like everything I do is just a waste of time, I feel like even if I try to tell myself -Hey, you're fine. People care about you, people care about your feelings.- I just can't believe it. I can't believe what I'm telling myself. My life has been so weird lately. I just don't feel like I'm myself anymore. I want to end it, end it all. It doesn't mean to kill myself, it just means that I don't want to live like this anymore. Even if I wanted to kill myself I already failed it. I don't feel right, I seriously don't. I tried talking about it with people but I'm so insecure when it comes to talking with others that I never actually solved any of my problems. I wish someone could help me, truly help me."
1872,depression,I’m ready to go,"When I kill myself tonight I’m going to think about everyone who tried to make me into a better guy. Anyone who tried to help me. I’m sorry to my friends, I’m sorry to my parents, I’m sorry to my teachers and I’m sorry to my therapists. But I can’t go on. I’m so fucking sad and I’ve been this way for years. I’m helpless. I’m useless. And I’m scared. So I’m going to save everyone the trouble and kill myself. I feel bad abandoning them all but I can’t stand living anymore. I’m ready to finally kill myself. I hope someone sees this when I’m gone."
1873,depression,Suicidal but not sad,So I’m 12 and I would say I’m kind of suicidal but I’m not really sad most of time it’s more like a “Dying doesn’t sound to shabby rn” or sometimes Earth gets boring.

like I don’t belong in this category of depressed people because compared to others, I’ve been blessed.

I know we shouldn’t compare whose had it worse, but I just don’t feel like I belong anywhere even when I’m with friends. I want to go home all the time. Even when I’m home, it feels like I’m not home. I’m tired of being high functioning and I just want to curl up into a ball until I know life has something for me. 

I’m only 21. Ive been sad for almost more than half my life. I’ve been sad for so long and now I don’t want to
leave this feeling."

For example, ""it won't always feel like this"" is easier to agree with / believe when you're not so down.

To work around this issue, **I put a note on my phone that reminds me of some of those important thoughts that I tend to forget** when my mood goes sour. So far, I have:

* temporary mood: it won't always feel like this
* stop fortune-telling: you literally don't know the future, so you can't be afraid of / sad about it, just like bad things can surprise you, so can the unexpectedly good

**What other important ideas** / thoughts would you add to this, to short-circuit the vicious circle?"

1880,depression,worsening dysfunction,"just to preface, im 21 and ive been struggling with depression/other mood disorders for most of my life. this year started out horribly for me and i still have not moved past the emotional state i was in in january. it's may now and i've realized that every time i get in these frequent deep depressive moods i convince myself im going to end my life. doing this is the only thing that calms me down and makes me feel better about my life and situation. but because ive convinced myself im not gonna be alive soon, ive effectively gotten nothing done at all this year. i stopped participating in college classes, i put off everything, and i keep excessively spending money. 

ive gone through therapy before, multiple times. each time i just feel less and less like its working. at this point i've given up on myself and i cant find the will to keep trying to get better. i guess it would be nice if i knew other people can relate to dysfunction thing at least? planning to end my life on multiple occasions this year alone has seriously distorted pretty much everything"
1881,depression,Achieving your goals doesn't mean shit to depression,"I hated the way I looked and was fat for all of my adolescence so I lost weight, did ab workouts and got the body I wanted.   
    
I wanted to go to a good college so I studied hard and got a 1540 on the SAT.   
    
I felt like I was treating my mom poorly so I made an effort to spend more quality time with her and be nicer to her.   
   
But still, every fucking day I think about how much I hate life and how much I want it to end as soon as possible. Even though I've done things I thought would make me happy, I am still the same unmotivated, unconfident piece of shit I was 4 months ago. I don't know if anything will ever make me a functional, happy person. For the most part I have stopped giving a shit about school and sleep, I'm failing like 6 classes right now and I have a flat out 0 in 4 of those classes A WHOLE MONTH into the marking period. The stress and anxiety are killing me. The more my problems grow, the more the stress, anxiety, and vices grow. The more the stress, anxiety and vices grow, the more my problems go. It's like some fucked up mutualistic relationship. I'm only 16 and I still have so much to learn about life so I'll trudge through it for now but I still have a fucked up brain living in fucked up conditions and it's all my fault."

Everyday has been fucking terrible since the 6th. If it wasn't for the stuff on valentine's day we'd still be fine maybe. All I have to blame is myself, I tried blaming it on ""higher forces"" like demons n stuff but eventually turned to alcohol and pot to suppress how I've felt. It's only gotten worse and I'm afraid one day I'll be fed up and be done. I've been suicidal before all this but fuel has been added that makes me feel it even more. I'm scared, alone, confused, and tired. I wish I could have the one friend back who actually made me happy but now he wants nothing to do with me but I dont blame him. This is karma for shit I've done in my past life. I was feeling pretty good last week but I felt I didn't even deserve to feel that way. Idk its 4 am I need to sleep and not obsesse over dumb shit so goodnight."

Everyday is the same wake up, get ready for online school, sit in a class I don't even listen to, after class go back to bed for a couple hours then stay up half the night. Again. And again over and over and over until someday maybe I'll realize its not worth it. It's not worth living another day. Breathing the same air as the ones above me, better than me. Lives worth more than mine . I'm just a mistake its my fault for being a burden for not having the motivation to clean my room, for not being happy all the time, for making my family worry about me not being ""the same happy little **GIRL** you used to be"". Maybe one day I'll act on those feelings, get tired of the voices in my head telling me to just end it all, get tired of feeling like everyone is laughing at me, making fun of me, get tired of not being a **NORMAL** happy **GIRL**....

Yeah but not today... Maybe tomorrow

I feel like I wake up and live the same day over and over and over again like I’ve been punished by god. I have to watch my baby siblings after a day of school where I get little personal support from my family and teachers than have to decide if I want to spend the couple remaining hours I have left in the day talking to my friends and spending time with them, online of course whether it be video game or FaceTime, which is the only thing that’s keeping me from loosing my mind, or doing the mountain of homework that gets assigned to me every night. I don’t go anywhere special, I don’t do anything unique, I’m just here wasting my life away doing the same thing every day. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t care if I died tomorrow if it means I don’t have to wake up and do the same thing I did yesterday. Ive been also been moving around a lot and I can’t do it anymore. My grades are going from a 4.0 to a 3.0, I feel like shit all the time, and I’m never really happy. Any tips on how I can cope? I’ve talked about it to my parents, they listen, but nothing really changes."
1893,depression,Is it better to just die?,"Sorry for the cringe title. Also I know no ones it probably going to read this so it’s more just for me. I’m 22 years old, I live with my parents. I have dropped out of uni 6 times, had 12 different jobs and hate my life. I recently broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years because of lying, no job and being the most pathetic fuck in existence. I knew it was coming but didn’t care. I’m currently on anti-depressants and it helped for a little bit but now I feel more lost than I have ever felt in my life. I’ve pushed everyone away, sleep for 16 hours a day and am probably going to kill myself as soon as a have enough courage to not be a bitch. I’m unmotivated, dishonest, disrespectful, unhygienic, ugly and dumb. That’s why I’m not happy, and I’ve tried fixing it for so fucking long and nothing helps. I’m just so close to ending it because I don’t see any other way out. I don’t wanna be stuck like this for the rest of my life but that’s all I can see constantly"
1894,depression,No room for improvement.,
1895,depression,I'm such a lousy brother,"I am 4 year older than him. Our parents often weren't there for us and I wound up being his role model. I didn't have a lot of empathy when I was young and was closer to a bully than a brother during his developmental years. I think I was 14 when I realized that I needed to shape up, but I had a lot of issues of my own by that time. I did my best, but I think I failed him in a lot of ways that matter. It was the blind leading the blind. 

I'm still his closest family member. He's very social and intelligent, but he doesn't express his emotions very much anymore. He's graduated college and is having trouble getting a job. Today I said some very harsh things that I shouldn't have. He accepted my apology and said that he was fine, but feel like I've left a scar. Even when I'm trying to be supportive I wind up saying things that hurt him. I'm terrified by the thought that my past abuse has made his life more difficult and painful than it should have been.

I wish there was someone else who could support him and be a role model. I don't deserve it and would rather he forgets me."
1896,depression,....,"No friends, no relationship, no job, zero self confidence, depressed, anxious, chronically il. No one ever approaches me. People just dislike me because of how awkward and quite i am. I’m just surviving life. what’s the point of continuing."
1897,depression,Am I Just Stupid?,"Every time I see or hear anything about my friends hanging out with other people, I can jealous and I think about the worst things. I think about that they'll leave me and I'll be alone again and I get in this depressive mood and I cry for a few days. I want it to stop but it won't. One of my friends gone somewhere, I don't know where they went. Think they might've left.... Am I just gonna live alone? I don't care if I die alone at this point. I feel like its to late for me, like there's nothing I can do to make things right with anything. My uncle hates me, he wants me and my dad dead. My mother cares more about my brother. I'm never the favorite, I'm never first. I'm always second or last. I hate it. I'm always angry all the damn time, I don't know why or how to stop being angry. Should I just end it now so people won't get hurt...?"
1898,depression,"I can’t find the right words to describe what’s going on I my head. I will have one version one second, and another some time again.",[removed]
1899,depression,Why won’t people love me?,"I’ve lost so many people in my life. People who I loved, and who I thought loved me, but they all are happier without me. I never really hear from my friends because they’re so busy, and they’re the only people I actually talk to. I have no family and my ex broke up with me about a month ago. I thought he loved me, but clearly I was wrong. I’m unlovable, and I don’t know why. I wish I knew so I could change myself and stop myself from getting hurt all the damn time."
1900,depression,Please someone tell there’s more to life than work,"This is the idea of life that has been pressed into my head and I just want someone to tell me it’s not true 

I go to school for a few years and half of the things I learn are useless. Then I get a full time job that I hate with a boss that I also hate. Once I get that job the friends I made also get full time jobs and I never see them again because all of us are so busy. I do this just to make enough money to survive, none of it goes to things I like it’s all just to pay rent and for food. Then after all of that I die probably wishing I’ve done more with my life

I know all of that has to sound stupid but this idea that life is just work until I die is so pressed into my head and no one even denies it so I just want one person to say I’m being dumb and that none of that is true."
1901,depression,Idk what I feel anymore.,"I just feel weird emotions now when I’m around people. I was hanging out with a group of friends and a few girls, we are all around the same age, but the way I’m talked to by the girls just feels weird. Like the words they say are normal and nice words but the way they are delivered feels like they think I am retarded(sorry if that word offends some people)or something. I’m not really a loner, just in my friend group I’m just kind of accepted as the dude who hangs around. I left early ash and walked home and they all kind of took offense to it like I didn’t wanna be around them which was kind of true but also idk. Anyone else experience a sort of self hatred almost after social interactions? Especially with the opposing gender?"
1902,depression,Slept with my brother feel so guilty,"I  was drunk last weekend and cannot forget it

&amp;#x200B;

please help"
1903,depression,What even is the point in trying to be happy?,"I’ve been wondering for a long ass time. I can laugh, have fun, enjoy moments when they happen but it all feels futile. It’s just temporary and when all is said and done, the moment passes and reality sets in. Its all temporary. Getting attached is just opening yourself up to getting let down and hurt. Again. 

The only person on the planet with putting any faith in is myself because at least then I know not to get my hopes up too high. At least then I can plan for the worst and make what I can out of what I have left. 

I’m tired of just going through the motions. Fake being happy at work so I can keep my job. Fake caring when customers call with problems. Fake liking my job. Waste money on impulse decisions just to find it within me to “feel” something. Try try and try to do things that I want to do but then give up because “why bother” and “I suck at it anyway”. 

In the end, I’ll just keep doing the same bullshit day in and day out because if I don’t, then I go further into this insurmountable debt gifted to me by the garbage ass American higher education system. 

Idk, at this point I’m just rambling. 

TL:dr 
Everybody will let me down eventually so why bother giving them a chance. Feelings of anything other than apathy are fake and won’t last so why bother."
1904,depression,"Life is just a waiting game. Eventually, you'll quit. Winning is a fool's dream.","I don't think there's any chance for me to having a future for myself. I keep hoping there is but I'm not doing anything right. I got kicked out of my mom and her husband's home after fighting over three months ago, I live with my dad who I keep stepping on his toes again and again despite my damndest to avoid causing problems, and I am applying for jobs that I doubt will ever hire me. If so, then I'm just gonna screw everything up again because my mind doesn't function normally.

I wanna give up. I just wanna quit and go back to my own little box so I can curl up and shrivel until no one ever has to deal with my problems ever again. Is there a way out of this? Please, that's all I am asking."

Light or dark
Good or bad
Life or death

Who am I. 
Wich path do I take. 
Why does your lord hate. 

Conflict in my head rages like a war between 2 major powers. There is great loss on each side. My core is being ripped apart from the inside. I rather die or go numb just walk blindly in the night on a path weather it’s right or wrong. 

I am so tired of this. I have tried religion, spirituality, therapy, consulting friends, meeting strangers, I’m alone. I’m lost. I’m depressed and I’m not sure where to go yet or at all. My whole life had been switching lanes but I’m tired. I’d rather find what’s right for me and commit. I’m tired of living this life."
1907,depression,"I'm screwed, aren't I?","I'm going to be honest with you. I'm so scared of the future, I know I'm only 14 and I haven't seen the world or been through much. But I know how screwed my thinking is. Right now my current plan is to find a girlfirend and then just breakdown. But I don't trust anyone not even myself. And who would even like a mess like me? I manage to even annoy myself and I still can't even talk about the shit that caused all of this. I can't get meds nor a therapist till I'm 18. So I have to hold this in, it's better than letting anyone else see how weak I am right? I don't know what to do, I'm so screwed."
1908,depression,Feeling Undesirable,"I’ve felt unlovable and unattractive for a very long time. Lately the feelings of being nothing more than a supporting character in my own life have been really strong. I feel like my friends don’t care, I’m undeserving of love or even lust, and like I’ll simply never be good enough. I just wanna know for once that I’m good enough for someone because I don’t know if I ever can be for myself."
1909,depression,I don't know what to do anymore,"Yesterday was supposed to be a good day. Instead it was probably one of the worst days of my life. It was my birthday.

 I started out my birthday crying and I ended it crying. I am away at college and I am on a D1 team but have to red shirt due to surgery, I am almost three months post op but I don't feel like my self and I haven't gotten back to where I was. I have teammates around me but I have never felt so alone. 

The other day I wanted to use a Swiss army knife to cut myself and only 2 people know, my mom and the person who tool it away. I don't want to talk to either of them thought because I don't want to be a burden on them. My parents are amazing but I only have been talking to them about the hard stuff and they say we don't like hearing you upset and it makes it 10 times worse. I don't want to rely on the other person because I am not close with them, I reached out to them out of desperation but I haven't gotten there yet.

Today I took a pair of tweezers to my arm cus it was the sharpest thing I had. I feel like I am dying and I am doing it all alone. I am going to therapy hopefully on Monday though my school but I don't how to get there. How can I push through when I have no drive. How can I go and do things like a human when I can't even get though with out crying. I am barely keeping afloat."

I feel like I’m a terrible person and I kind of deserve to die. I’m 19 and I feel like an outcast to society who doesn’t really have much to offer and I’m not sure I just sometimes don’t see myself thriving at for example age 23,24,25. I guess what’s holding me back is my family would be completely devastated and I don’t think I can wrap my head around doing that to them. I’m in therapy and on antidepressants and I’m super grateful for being able to have access to help but sometimes I feel like I’m pretty helpless/kind of a burden to help.

1914,depression,"Something is always missing and no matter what I do, I can't identify what it is.","I've had this feeling for as long as I can remember. There's always this void in me that I can't seem to fill no matter what I try, although I was able to cope reasonably well previously by devoting myself to a hobby. Even those changed like the weather because I just couldn't really find meaning in anything for more than a few months at most. Still, it was comforting to have something to hold on to and obsess over, something to distract myself with. Well, those days are gone. I was forced to give up the one and only passion I had in life due to factors outside my control...and now my life feels completely empty. Joyless. I can't even be productive at work anymore. Everything feels pointless. I feel like I've just had a bad breakup, or lost a loved one. Worst of all, there's no guarantee that I'll ever find anything else to replace this loss. 

I just wish my happiness didn't hinge on a single, specific obsession that could easily be taken away from me. I wish I could hold on to a source of happiness for once...except good things never last, and the only constant in my life is the huge hole in my soul."

1916,depression,I don’t know what to do anymore,"I have struggled with my mental health for as long as I can remember. Most of my problems stem from being abused and bullied as a child. Recently, I’ve uncovered that my fiancé whom I am madly in love with has been cheating on me for 6 months or more. To make matters worse, she is 12 weeks pregnant with my child. Up until we officially split 3 days ago I had done my best to give her all of my love, effort, and financial support. I know pregnancy is hard, so I was doing my best to make it easier. I know men have been unkind to her in the past, but I was doing my best to be different. I wanted to be her happy ending. Even though she has wronged me, a part of me still does. We recently started putting together a nursery, but now our little home is left broken. I’m worried about the future. I don’t know how often I’m going to see my unborn daughter. I don’t know if my broken heart will ever heal. I just want to be a good father. I don’t have enough strength for the emotional and legal battle I am about to be forced to fight. I am having a hard time waking up in the morning and going to work. I am having a hard time eating and drinking normally. I just want this nightmare to be over."

I just seen a 16 year old developer get their game on the switch (inspiration for this post), which is impressive (and a little jealous), and I've always wanted that but I now feel like I'm out of my league. I've tried learning how to code but I never knew where I could practice, or had any friends that would give help or hand out advice. I've always been alone and I've tried my best to push forward with a smile and optimistically head towards my future but I don't know if I can handle it anymore. I mean I tried college...

people have just been treating me so terribly for some reason lately, and at first i was able to remove myself out of the situation and understand that maybe it isnt all my fault. but now i feel like all of it is. 

im getting strong urges to sh again, but im trying really really hard not to. for my own sake this time, since every time i try to do it for someone else, i fail. 

i wish there was that person in my life who genuinely cared about me enough to check in on me, ask how im doing, without me having to always start the conversation. its like nobody even likes me enough to talk to me willingly. it sucks. 

anyways, gonna go cry some of this out. lets see if it helps. if anyone wants to talk lmk. i hope everyone is doing well tonight."

i can't connect, as much as i want to, so i just wish to help

i'm going to fail in this life, i just know it.   
those who loved me will remember me as the perfect son,

but will you remember me? a turgid thought sloshing around in your brain?  
will you look at this text and see something in it? have i helped you at all?  
because i try. as little as i try, i try, and i want to help.

1922,depression,Mental Illnesses in Media,I hate how media portrays mental illnesses in general but what really gets me is how they portray love being the cure all. I’m not saying it can’t help. But someone with OCD isnt going to magically stop the compulsions just by falling in love. Someone with depression isn’t going to become “normal” just because they are in a healthy relationship. Love helps but it’s not a fix all/cure all. I think a lot of people wouldn’t feel so insecure/ have low self esteem if people didn’t put so much pressure on finding “the one” or that the only way to feel fulfilled in life is to be in a romantic relationship. I understand humans are social creatures and love is important in being healthy and such things.

There’s times where this happens and then I go back to my depressive state but this is the longest it’s lasted and I’m feeling hopeful. Only problem is my anxiety feels so much worse. Is it that I notice my anxiety more now that I am less depressed?

These days I was telling her if she would be open to online therapy. She interpreted that as if I was manipulating her to get therapy."

1927,depression,Nothing to look forward to,"There's no enjoyment in my life. I don't really know what to do. I have nothing going on. Every day is the same. Wake up, work, eat, sleep. I look forward to getting home from work every day just to realize there's nothing for me to do. My hobbies have all but lost their fun. Haven't enjoyed a game since last september. Have barely touched my guitar. Can't concentrate on anything. I'm unbearably lonely which is a feat because I do quite like being by myself but it's really gotten to the point where it's making me even more miserable. I've never had a strong friend group despite trying. I would love nothing more than to make music with people but in my multiple efforts of trying it has always failed. I'm 20 and have never had a girlfriend or sex. I'm not an incel loser and don't hate women, it's obviously my fault. I'm completely undesirable. I tried tinder. Had one date that went well then ghosted. Had a date with a different girl and while we're still talking I don't think she's into me as much as I am her. This all feels so worthless. I don't have fun I don't enjoy things. I'd love to just hang out at a friend's house and watch a movie but I'll probably just drink myself to sleep again. This has been rambling and all over the place I'm just so completely unsatisfied with every facet of my life. This isn't worth it."
1928,depression,I messed up the most crucial years and my life will never get better.,"I used to be someone with such a bright future ahead. Or at least it seemed so. I graduated top of my class and went to med school, but I dropped out only after the first year. Thing is, I do enjoy studying, and it's probably the only thing I'm good at. However, I'm terrible at managing stress. The long study hours, waking up extremely early to commute, having no friends, and a general sense of not really having passion for Medicine ended up taking a mental toll on me and I dropped out. I realized that there's really nothing I'm passionate or genuinely love, I just want a stable job with a stable income to support myself and my unproductive hobbies. This exact lack of ambition is what ultimately caused my downfall. I chose Medicine because I was told the entire time of doctor's secure employment, being highly esteemed, etc. etc. and I went with it thinking it was the safe path, never considering that I lacked the intelligence and ambition to make it.

My Asian family is very conservative, and they took horribly my news of dropping out. They told me I quit because I was lazy, because I didn't try hard enough, that I never finish anything, etc. etc. And their reaction made me fall into a deeper depression. I was already having a hard time in school, so hearing my parents berate me instead of comfort me through a difficult moment was so hard to process. I've realized that I'm nothing more than a trophy for them to brag to their friends and family and I failed to do my job, and now I'm worth less that dirt to them.

After that I started working odd jobs and helping them out, all while holding the faith I'd one day go back to college. One day I find what is it I like and want to do for the rest of my life. It has taken me very long I admit, but it's hard for me as I spent my entire youth studying just for the sake of good grades and never developed interest for any particular subject.

And then I became 23, and my parents started pushing me to go to blind dates, to chat with their friends' sons in hopes that a relationship can start from there. They told me I was at the age of getting married and having children. And when I told them I actually wanted to go back to college and make something out of myself before even thinking of marriage, they immediately rejected the idea. They told me I wasn't capable nor smart enough for that, and that marrying someone with a stable job or business was the absolute best way to find money. I honestly don't want to be married nor have children anytime soon. Maybe never. I've even considered being aromantic or maybe I'm just not ready. I don't think I'll ever be as long as I feel this unstability in my head.

We had a huge discussion, and now I'm goong through a panic attack. Because I've realized that my life won't ever get better from here. I've got no university diploma, no real job experience, and I'm financially dependent of my parents so going against them would guarantee getting kicked out of my home. I've been frantically searching for jobs online that require no experience, cheap apartments, and what careers I could complete and find a decent job with despite being stupid.

My parents haven't seriously said they'll kick me out, but just the fact that I could lose their financial support one day and probably die on the streets, the fact that I'll always have to depend of someone, my parents, a husband, etc. to get by in life. It's fucking making me insane but at the same time I feel like I'm too stupid and useless to even attempt to survive on my own if I try to live by myself. Why couldn't have taken a different path after high school, not overestimate myself and study something less hard.

I'm scared, I feel like my life will never get better, I hate myself for making such terrible decisions, I hate that money exists, I hate that I'm not smart nor passionate enough, my self-esteem is on the floor and my anxiety on the roof.

It's a fear that has been gnawing at me ever since I was young, the possibility of not being a competent person that can support herself. I made all my life choices based on that goal alone but I completely failed because I'm stupid. And now I'm an adult and my fear has come true and I don't know what to do."
1929,depression,Why is everyone ditching me ?,"I never had a real friend and whenever I become a bit closer with somebody they ditch me few days later. I feel like I'm cursed or something. I do not change my behaviour or anything and really have no clue why is that happening. Like at first they tell me how awesome I am only to become so distant few days later. 
I'm becoming more and more scared of getting into some closer relationships with anyone, and I'm talking only about becoming friends, nothing more. I feel like I'm just a complete misfit that will never be dear to anyone"
1930,depression,I feel like I’ve been dead ever since the first time I wanted to kms but didn’t.,"The first time I was ever severely suicidal was about a decade ago, I didn’t not do it because I decided I wanted to live, I didn’t do it because my parents. Maybe that reason to live is enough for a bit, but for how long? Am I really living if I’m only living for other people? Will I ever want to be alive again? 

I’ve done everything I’m supposed to do to try to treat my depression and other mental health issues, but nothings ever helped besides relationships that inevitably end and leave me worse than before. 

Despite all this, I’m still moving forward on paper. I moved out of my home state, I’m in grad school, I’m trying. But I’m still the same. I still don’t want any of this. I’m tired of going out in the day and trying to function and then coming home and collapsing and crying and staring at walls and having my parents tell me I’m handing it all so well."
1931,depression,invisible,"i don’t know if this is directly related to my depression or something else.... but does anyone else feel like they don’t make a mark on anyone’s life? like, i have a couple friends but if i wasn’t here they would be completely fine. like i’m nothing special. i don’t add or take away from anyone’s experience. i don’t do anything exciting or creative. i’m just here floating it seems like. nobody thinks of me first or needs me anywhere. it’s sad but i hate to pity myself for something that feels like my fault"
1932,depression,I’m just so f*cking tired of this,"I wake up every day majorly depressed. It’s like a giant cloud that never goes away. I fake that I’m fine and I force myself to go about my day. I’m a full time college student double majoring in genetics and microbiology and I work in a research lab, and I can’t afford to let myself fail. Even when I just want to curl into a ball and cry myself to sleep and give in to self harm urges, I force myself to do what I need to do that day. But I’m so tired of living like this and I just want to be happy again. I’ve gotten so good at hiding my depression that not a single person knows when it’s bad, even my own parents could tell my psychiatrist if my meds were helping or not. I’m tired of “always being so happy and energetic” and “always willing to give” without receiving nothing in return. I know I shouldn’t think that way, but I feel forgotten and alone and like no one cares. I’m technically diagnosed bipolar 2, but sometimes I doubt it because my meds don’t help anymore and I’m mostly just depressed. It takes everything in my to keep going every day and it’s exhausting. I was diagnosed with depression at age 7 and I’ve been living like this for almost 11 years, and I’m just so done with all of it. I want so desperately to be happy and for this cloud to go away, but I’ve kind of lost hope. I’ve tried so many things and I feel like the only way out is killing myself, but I could never do that to my family and friends. I exercise daily, eat a healthy diet, get enough sleep, take my vitamins, etc. All the things people say because “it’s just situational.” Maybe, but it’s been 10 fucking years and it’s never gotten better. The worst part is that depression is so glamorized today that I feel like some overdramatic teenager when I tell someone I’m struggling. But even when I tell people that I need help, they don’t seem to care and they do the basic minimum. Like, “oh, I’m sorry. I hope it gets better soon.” I’m sorry for this long post because I’m ranting now, but I’m so alone and this is really my only outlet. Thank you for reading."
1933,depression,Im honestly really scared,"I've been drunk every day for the last two weeks. I'm scared i'm going to start doing drugs again. I used to be pretty hard on pills until i ended up in the hospital. Then after a two years of staying clean i moved onto stims pretty hard for about a year. These last few years i've replaced drugs with alcohol because of my job. This last year has been absolute hell for me. I've tried to do the deed, i've been SH. I've been drinking so much more. I've been drunk every day for the last two weeks. 

For the last few months before that i was drunk at least every other day. In less than two months i'm finally going to be done with my job and go to college. I'm excited, but i'll finally have the freedoms i had a few years back when i was abusing drugs. I'm especially scared about taking pills again. After my hospital thing, I wanted nothing to with pills. But my depression and anxiety has been so bad lately, all i can think about is taking pills again. Im scared im going to start popping again and im afraid im not going to be able to walk away from it this time"

1938,depression,My work held a small get together/party for everyone tonight. I stood outside too afraid to go in and talk to anyone and just went home,"So it was a small office mixer in celebration of Easter and the long weekend we all have coming up. And it was held at some upscale little club that also had a second level to it so you could look out over a balcony to the street. Some part of me said I should go, mainly because I've worked at this company for two years now and single digit amount of people know who I am, and we're not that big of a company. ""You have to leave your comfort zone"" they said. There was even one girl I knew that had gotten out of a relationship recently I was hoping to chat with and get to know better. Maybe it would go somewhere.

I took a Lyft there and came around the street corner and immediately as soon as I saw people walking in and how busy it was, I shut down and nearly threw up from nervousness. But I had a jacket with a hood on it and threw my head on and I walked down the street a bit to get a better look inside since it just had big open windows you could see all the way in. It just looked...fun. Everyone just looked like they were having a great time. And the music playing was actually good and stuff I like to listen to. Everyone in there looked happy and glad to be there, even the people who came by themselves. Meanwhile, I'm stood on the other side of the street in an alleyway watching the whole thing hoping not to get noticed.

I also did notice the girl I liked walk in with a few co-workers and that was when my urge to actually go over and head in was at its strongest, but my feet still felt like they were in cement shoes and I didn't move, continuing to stand there like some creeper and outcast. I even saw her sitting at the bar by herself, bored out of her mind it seemed, but pretty as she always is.

Eventually I just gave up and walked back around the corner and called for another Lyft to get me and I went home. I threw and broke something off my coffee table out of anger and kicked one of my kitchen cabinets as well. Then I went and sat in my room in complete darkness and silence, thinking about how much I failed.

I just wanted to tell someone about this. Call me whatever you want, I don't really care at this point. Don't really care about a lot of things anymore."
1939,depression,Ever been in the middle of the club and still depressed? Right now? oh okay me too,I didn’t come dressed and I don’t feel pretty. It was good at first. I was dancing and having fun. Now i’m just radiating anxiety. I can’t wait to actually feel pretty inside my own body. Tonight was supposed to be different but I guess not. I’m not crying or anything so that’s a plus I guess
1940,depression,Life is so easy.,"Just imagine how easy it would be to just get up in the morning and go to work. Think about how even though some ‘normal’ (mentally stable) people might not want to go, they do anyways. Imagine how easy it would be to get up and simply be able to do things. Productive things. Hobbies. Jobs or Job interviews. School. Socializing. Consistent routines. Relationships.

1943,depression,"I can't convince myself to act, even if I'm aware I should. I don't know why I decided to write this,but any thoughts?","M29, I've been depressed for a long time, years in fact. A lot have happened in my life, and it took me a lot of time to put a word on some of these events, and even acknowledge what repercussions they had on me.


Recently, I had a session with a therapist who wanted to see if I was mentally able to work. It was a mandatory interview within a project to help me find a job. After the session, she told me to seek for therapy, indicated where I could find options within my very limited budget. She also asked me to keep her informed about what I decide.


But here's the thing. I know I have issues. Self-esteem, trust,etc... But I can't bring myself to try this. I can't help but think I'm overreacting, I'm being a drama queen, other people has had a lot worse than me... I think of this because I specified my age at the beginning, but I also find myself thinking I'm... Too old to have these issues? When I talk to my friend about my past, I totally ""accept"" this part of my personality, but when it comes to my (I don't know the word in english, unability to make anything? ) , I can't help but think I use it as an excuse to be lazy. 


Even writing this, I think how I'm saying some rather commonplaces, and someone will just call me out for faking or being over dramatic.


Does someone could explain to me why I call myself depressed while refusing to seek professional help?

1944,depression,Middle School Teacher Ruined My Life,"Below is a poem I wrote 10 minutes ago, laying on my couch as my wife sleeps in the room one over. When I was 12 I was dumb, I came out as transgender. My guidance counselor made me regret this decision every single day, I was told I had a disease that could harm others and I need to be contained till I did not have this disease any longer. Every day in 7th grade for 3 months I would see my counselor and he would lock me in a closet after yelling at me for an hour if I still said I was transgender. After three months I went back in the closet. I stayed their for 11 years, I missed important lessons, my grades plummeted, I always wanted to be a lawyer when I was little. I graduated high school with a 1.9 GPA. 

&amp;#x200B;

He ruined my life, I have tried to end my life twice, nothing recent though. But I am still horribly depressed and full of anxiety. I am looking for a job now but my grammar sucks I am stuck. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The darkness is not scary, but not being able to leave is where the fear lies.

Dark circles, Dark rims, Dark hair. Locking the ones full of light in the darkness.

No life, No air, the flicker quickly vanishing in the dark.

Eyes shut to escape their dark to be in your dark. Your dark is controllable.

Your dark is still full of light.

Your dark is the crisp morning air with the stars above and birds waking up bringing light to you.

Your light is the birds chirping and the asphalt below your tires, the wind in your hair. The flash of a car and the darkness stealing time away from your light. The birds chirping and the darkness telling you to keep your eyes closed. The darkness will be done with you soon.. then you can pretend it never happened and you can enjoy the light again. Enjoy the light, lay in the sun, enjoy the warmth. 

Eyes open, it's dark but it's your darkness, your darkness is safe, till you fall into his darkness. His darkness is not supposed to be dark. Dark Rims, Dark Circles  are not supposed to be dark they should be full of light, full of guidance, counsel you into the light. Lifting you up, but in the end pushing you deeper into their darkness. You go into your darkness, the darkness you once controlled. The darkness full of birds chirping, stars lighting your way, the dark asphalt, the darkness experienced in the day. The darkness. The dark that blends into the rest of the room. Not being able to leave the darkness. Lying trapped in the darkness."
1945,depression,I feel like I'm watching my life unfold from someone else's pov,"Every day is the same. Dread going to school, dread going to work.

1946,depression,What even makes people happy ?,"I can't identify any emotion within me apart from pure negativity and anxiety.
I'm currently an undergrad and live alone. I'm working as an intern.
The days are just painful. I don't know why I get out of bed apart from having to check up on work. I have a mild headache throughout the day, am always on the verge of crying (but never can) and just feel empty.
On the surface I'm doing very well. I have a very decent intern, I'm in a very well known college, have good job offers and appear to have goals. But what people don't realise is that all this crap is made up. I only work like a maniac because it stops reminding me of my sorry life and I stop feeling miserable. All my goals are just made up in my mind to keep me going somewhere (I have no idea what I actually want to do). 
People tell me to do some hobby or do something which makes you happy. I have no hobbies and don't even know what makes me happy. The sheer level of my anxiety also prevents me from actually doing anything that isn't work or study related. Now even my friends avoid talking to me because all I can talk about is work or go on rants.

It's not as if I haven't tried going for professional help. I'm on medication and take a ton of pills everyday but there have been occassions where I've just wanted to end it all.

It all looks like a rant again but all I'm asking is a simple question. How do people get hobbies and what even makes them happy ?"
1947,depression,About to graduate from nursing school and not sure if I want to be a nurse...feeling like I wasted 4 years of my life,"I was always excited to be a nurse but I think seeing the pandemic's effect on healthcare workers really just makes me not want to be a nurse anymore. Seeing my roommates and friends during college not having to worry about it, having high-paying jobs, etc makes me depressed when nurses are expected to do so much and get so little out of it. I don't know how I can switch careers or go back to school without having to spend so much money. I'm feeling so empty and depressed now, I feel like I majorly fucked up. I want to kill myself idk it just seems so much easier than living a life that I don't want to live"

Mentions of Depression, Self-Harm, Depressing Thoughts

​

So yeah I wanted to vent about this, I will clarify first I love my sister and so does she, she just can be kina insensitive and it can hurt a lot.

My sister (16 F) isn't exactly the best with emotions, I am a 13 F and have had depression for about 5+ years.

She found out about my self-harm along with my family, and the first thing she says to me is: 

""People who do self-harm is stupid, self-harm is stupid""

It hurts, and I don't really know what to think of it, I don't even know if I'm right in saying she's wrong.

1949,depression,Unmotivated between jobs (schools),"Hey guys, I found that I am unable to enjoy my alone time for quite a long time. As the covid lockdown happened and me graduating from school. The gigantic amount of time really makes me depressed. I was always focused on my career, studies, or building romantic relationships. Now, I have nothing to do and I don't feel motivated to keep myself busy with studies when I don't have to. 

Although I used to be very motivated on working out, reading, music etc. I don't feel the enjoyment of doing anything for a few months.

My only hope is that everything returns to normal when my school starts in Aug. Still, it feels like a very long time for me to kill. Please comment your advice on this situation."
1950,depression,Fuck depression,"Didn't workout for weeks. Earlier I worked out. Wasn't my longest workout but it was okay. However.. I had got a little bit hyped after. Now I feel so horrible again. The gym is closed and I lost a lot of  my progress :( All those hard work of grinding 4-5am in the gym daily for years and covid fucks it all up. Man . I gotta eat properly though. thats very tough with depression. If I get enough protein in daily, enough calories, it will set myself up to keep working out. Deep down i know i am a savage. Otherwise I would not still be alive. I want to do amazing things in life like triathlons/MMA/compete in powerlifting at a high level. I am a prospect in life, barely even started. Everyone else is ahead. Depression is such a tough obstacle. But IF I don't ever workout or do anything positive for myself, I become dangerously suicidal. So if i want to stay alive i gotta keep working out"
1951,depression,Can’t support my depressed roommate cause I am depressed,"My roommate, also my ex bf and my BFF, got really depressed this year. Some 4.5 years ago he got me out of suicidal, horrible depression. But I never truly stopped being depressed. It’s more like walking depression for me. 

He used to help me. Now he got depressed, I want to help him but instead I feel completely wrong-footed without his support and I fail repeatedly at helping him. I feel like an awful person and I feel guilty for his depression. Maybe my depression sucked all the juices out of him. Or maybe my affairs (after we broke up but while we continued sharing a room) did. 

I just feel like such a complete waste of space, his time and energy, and an excuse for human being because I cannot get myself to stop being depressed. 

The actual reason why he is depressed is Covid and college. He did not graduate on time while I did, and he was barely coping with his courses since the online format is just awful, draining and inhumane. 

The reasons why I was and am depressed are abusive relationships and rape when I was a teen, immigration, the city I live in and a fear of coming back to the country I am from due to potential political persecution there as well as classes and deadlines before I graduated."
1952,depression,I don’t think having friends is meant for me.,"This may be a little long, so I do apologize in advance.

All of my life, I’ve tried to fit in. My father never wanted me; he left before I was even born. My mom never really had time for me, so I kind of just retreated into myself or played with siblings if they felt like it. From a young age, I knew I was wired differently. I always clung to people. If I met someone new and liked them, they immediately became my friend and I saw a “forever” with them. The problem is, we all know that some people aren’t meant to stay in our lives forever. I know it, yet somehow a part of me tries to make it permanent. I feel everything so intensely. There’s no such thing as “not serious” or “not a big deal” because in my brain, everything is serious, even when I don’t want it to be or think it shouldn’t be.
I never really felt like I fit in with any group of friends I had. I was just... there. Like a picture on the wall you glance at but never really see.

Fast forward to now. I’m 25. I’m still having a hard time making and keeping friends. There’s a person that’s been in my life for years. In the beginning, we talked every day for hours. A lot had changed since then. He had a child and just has a lot on his plate. (My mental state is terrible at the moment, so unfortunately I’m having a hard time with employment and just life in general.) But I’m so used to us talking every single day because that’s how it’s always been. I asked him the other day why he never talks to me. He said I was taking it way too personal and that he doesn’t intentionally do it. I feel like an inconvenience to everyone around me, even my boyfriend of almost 5 years. He’s so loving and truly the best thing that has ever happened to me. But I feel like I bother him too. I feel like I bother everyone just by existing. That’s pretty much it.

If you read all that, thank you so much."

I have good days and bad days, but there are days when my loneliness brings me to my knees and I stop whatever I'm doing, crawl back into bed, hug my pillow and cry myself to sleep, all whilst I have this horrible butterfly feeling in my heart, and I wouldn't wish that feeling on my worst enemy or the people that I blame for my lonliness. 

The reason I'm posting is because I get that same awful, hopeless feeling when I read the things posted in this sub and it pains me to see people feeling so lost and hopeless. Seeing peoples troubles makes me scared for the future because I know that in 10 years time, I'll still be alone, crying myself to sleep and have that decaying feeling in my heart.

I'm not sure what the purpose of this post is, sometimes I use reddit to express what I'm feeling, and was just curious if anyone knows the feeling I'm talking about or can relate. Please don't take offence to me saying I get scared seeing other peoples posts and problems because it's not my intent to cause trouble or upset anyone. 

Never let anyone make you feel selfish, guilty, or make out that you're just seeking attention, because your feelings and experiences are valid, and fuck anyone that tries to make you feel bad or doubt yourself for feelings and experiences that are completely out of your control. It's not your fault you're hurting, and I hope one day you can look back on these times and smile because you know that the worst in behind you. ❤"

1960,depression,a little of where I am tonight...," I (22F) have been depressed for as long as I can remember; I am not writing to speak of my many problems. There is just a particular 'thing' that has been bothering me for a few days and I think it is best to start there. I am not someone to easily open up, and have always been choosy with my words. Recently someone on a dating site had reached out to me. I get a decent amount of people messaging me since I do not struggle in the looks department, but I always drop conversations because they are never interested in actual conversation. It's gotten to the point that I don't even bother anymore. I guess recently I have been feeling alone because I decided to answer some of the messages. I told one of the dudes that I was conversing with that I would go on a date with him when I finished school in a few weeks, he seemed shocked that I would go out with him and we immediately exchanged socials. On my social he started to reveals his true intentions by messaging me things like, ""I'm horny"". Usually I would just block someone like that but instead I explained to him that I would not talk to him that night then since that is not the direction I want to go with someone I have not known for even 5 hours. The next day I was messaging him while at school; just asking random things like what hobbies or aspirations he has which he could barely respond to. He then asked me if I could do him a favor since he was having a bad day. The favor was for me to send him a booty pic. I just blocked him.

 Side note: I know that some of you touched-starved people would be mad at me for that; but please understand that a shoe doesn't fit all sizes. I have been groped before and lied to because of people's inability to think beyond their desires and not be able to see me as fully human because of sex appeal that I do not give a damn about.

 Back to the topic: after blocking this guy I went back and read another guy's message, who I was certain would follow the same routine as everyone else. Strangely he never did anything to offend me as we texted each other for a couple days; we even exchanged numbers (which is something I never do). As he texted me I noticed that he was careful with his words and I appreciated that. He later asked me why I picked him and I said that I liked his emotional intelligence and talking with him was fun, and he likewise felt the same about me. For the first time I felt like I was actually connecting with someone that I found ideal. After a couple days I noticed that the messaging was starting to dry. It felt like he was trying to fade. I gave a few more puffs to the exhaust of the conversation until he completely ignored the last message I sent two days ago.

 I guess where my problem lies is in wanting a genuine connection, and feeling so close to it too to just find out it is a mirage in a dry desert."

1964,depression,Ketamine therapy process feelings,"Hi. Recently I tried ketamine therapy once at clinic by intravenous injection. It lasted about a hour, and I feeled like in true psychodelic trip. I'm not sure, but seems that I got 0.5mg/kg dosage. But later I got some problems with this clinic, and by the way it's too expensive.

So, I read famous post on reddit about ketamine and depression. Researcher wrote that ""sad person"" can insufflate same 0.5mg/kg each 10 minutes 5 times to recieve positive antidepressive effect. Which I did. And during this procedure I didn't feeled anything unusual, just as reasearched said.

So, well, question, is so different effect related only to method of taking, or maybe there's other reasons?

By the way, didn't feeled any improvement in my depression after 1 IV procedure, neither 2 insufflations."
1965,depression,Venting again,I quit my job a few weeks ago because I felt to depressed and have no motivation I try to keep my facade of being ok in front of my family but I just wanna yell and just punch a wall or harm myself but I'm a pussy and I hate where I'm still at the point of wanting to die and barely wanting to keep existing
1966,depression,Can somebody comment anything please?,"Seriously there are too much on my plate... I've been struggling as long as I remember but this is just beyond my level. If this isn't the hell, I don't know what is.

Depression, social anxiety, suicidal thoughts, I lost my friend and my long time crush 3 days ago at the same time, one of my the other friend told me something bad to me which is my fault, my parents are on the verge of divorce, I have a tons of assignments to do, mid term is just around the corner, no goal nothing just nothing to look forward to...

I tried, I mean I really tried. I've started taking antidepressants last summer, seeing therapist, tried riding a bicycle etc but this is all I got?

Is it really selfish to end this life with all of these? Seriously? You call it selfish? No, I don't think so, even if I were being called ""selfish"", I would end this life for my sake."

1968,depression,everything got worse somehow and i feel very lonely. need to vent.,"i need to vent where nobody knows me so here i am.
life has gone downhill and i hate it. my best friend and i stopped talking and hanging out for some reason and i just miss him. i got into a relationship and then suddenly it felt like we weren’t friends anymore. the relationship is good for me and it’s healthy, but due to my own mental health i have some serious communication issues and can get frustrated easily sometimes and be a little sensitive for some reason. i love him and he loves me and it’s been very good but i just feel like since then, my life has somehow gone to absolute shit in all other areas and i just feel so fucking lonely all the time. my boyfriend is very encouraging and says stuff like “well get through it” and i wish that’d make me feel better but it doesn’t for some reason and i still feel so fucking alone. i wish i knew what was wrong with me. i wish i didn’t lose my closest friend. i just miss being happy. i miss feeling ok."
1969,depression,"Not poetry, but still something I wish I could cry aloud","I love the Snowfall, her frigid white visage streaked with pain. I gave her warmth, the cold dead joining her in solemn waltz. That’s how it should have been. But I blinked. I blinked and she melted. The sun came out, her cruelty and bitterness. I’d loved the sun once, but no more. My Snowfall looked to me and sighed, leaving our somber waltz. The sun broke her down, and taking her from me and putting her in the sky to be hers again. She left my heart to burn. I should be angry, but I cannot muster that. I’m too weak, too weak to acknowledge how the Snowfall let me love, and let me die. But I don’t blame the Snowfall. The sun owns her, and I? I’m the cold dead, I have no stake, no claim. I’m the hollowness I wish I’d snuffed out long ago. And maybe one day, I will. I hate you Spring, you took my Snowfall from me. You beat me down with sun, and stole what joy I had left. You should have killed me....I wish you had."

1972,depression,Torment,"It seems my world is falling apart. No clear direction for life to take me. Seeing my finances dwindle along with my hope, until all is left is a small ember until that too is put out and everything becomes darkness.

Waking up at ungodly hours noticing the world around me is dead. Which step do I take when everything is chaos.

Afflicted indecision and the villain of time. If I don't do something drastic now, like move abroad, change my surroundings, then I may not get the chance as I'm almost 30. I fear the sacrifice that would have to be made--family, my cat, my culture.

I've slept in the same clothes for a few days now. I haven't changed into anything. My dirty laundry sits there as a reminder of my messed up life. It also symbolizes the boulder in the Myth of Sisyphus that must be rolled up a hill only for it to fall back down and have to be pushed again. Camus thought Sisyphus might've found meaning in the struggle; for me, I don't see it. I see the arbitrariness of life and having to repeat such cycles of suffering (eg: work).

My hair is unruly but I don't want to go to the barber. I'd rather stay at home and not have the anxiety of having to show the face of despair in public. If there is someone you shouldn't invite to parties, it's definitely me. I'll ruin your party and give you an existential crisis as well.

My glasses are kind of broken which means I can't drive to the optician to get them fixed. I woke up close to 7pm so the optician wasn't even open, nor could I take a bus to get there anyway. Instead, I spend my time on reddit alone and in darkness. For the past months, indeed I have lived in torment."
1973,depression,What's there to say?,"Honestly guys. There really ain't much to say. Depression is so common and depression in men is also coming to light daily. There are more resources uploaded daily on how to handle depression and I think we are in a age where there's more help than ever.   


Everyday I try to improve myself. Become a better version of myself. I have come to accept things. I have learnt that not everything is in your control. And that is fine. When I talk to people they say I am wise. Experienced. I know life is not perfect and I want to make the best out of it. I won't say that I have a horrible past, but I have been in some bad situations and places in my life. But I am in a better position than I have ever been. A great opportunity that makes my whole future secure. Amazing people that always supports me. Life is amazing!  


Then why. Why is it that I still wake up depressed in the morning. Lose motivation by just opening my eyes. This feeling of loneliness just creeping in and telling me stay away from everyone. My will just crashing, my anxiety flaming me. I start overthinking everything again. Start playing future conversations in my head, preparing for the worst. I start pitying myself. And with the combination of all of this, I start hating myself.   


I am sure I am not the only one."
1974,depression,My Ex got married.,"Fuck its been over two years and I can't fucking feel any better. She dumped me for him. She's was so much of what I loved and everything has been so much worse since I lost her.

She moved to Germany with the intention of me following a few months later. Lo and behold she finds someone new. She dumps me and they are dating right away. Why did she have to treat me so terribly when I did nothing to deserve that? Why do I still love her so much after all this?

Now I find out she married him. We're young. I thought I had a few years before I ever had to mentally prepare myself for this. I think its a ""greencard"" marriage so she can travel back to Germany with the pandemic but it doesn't matter. She loves him.

I haven't found any women attractive since I started dating her so I can't just find someone else. We also knew each other since we were kids so no one else I'll ever meet will know me so deeply. I just want to stop existing at this point."

I want to stop feeling this way but how can I when very little makes me happy?"

1978,depression,I don’t have anybody who really cares,"It’s my own fault. I go through periods where I don’t pick up the phone to call my mom, and I won’t see my friends for months at a time. I can’t work at a real job because within six months of getting hired it all goes up in a fiery blaze when I start no-showing and getting high at home instead. My boyfriend says he doesn’t want kids with me because I’d be a bad mom. I’d be a good house wife though I guess. I’m pretty sure he only keeps me around as his personal drug and sex dispensary since I can offer literally nothing else to him.

Everyone has given up on me. My parents don’t call, or respond to my texts. All my aunts and uncles stopped trying to have a relationship with me. My closest friend doesn’t consider herself close with me anymore. I guess I should try to be grateful, because the less people who love me, the less I’m capable of hurting.

I don’t have the motivation or will within me to feel anything but exhaustion. I’m tired. I’m so lonely. This is gonna die in new with the rest of the cries for help, but I think I’m just hoping one person might have heard me and understood. 

Maybe I don’t deserve to be heard. Maybe nobody can understand it because I’m so wrong. But I can’t change it anymore. The person I was who had the ability to adapt and move forward doesn’t exist anymore. All I can do is mimic the same movements I’ve been making for years. I’m so fucking tired of it."
1979,depression,"Hi uhhh, what in the ever loving fuck is wrong with me :)","Hello I'm an 18F ( I'm sorry if I suck at this I'm new to reddit) and the point of this post is to vent and to ask if I'm a spoiled brat who's sad cause I'm not used to the big outside world or if im sad cause something is wrong with me.

I started uni bout a month and a bit ago. Im going to the uni I wanted to and doing the courses I choose and was actively excited to do. I'm living away from home for the first time in a halls of residence and luckily due to living in new Zealand and having amazing parents I have first year free with no loans needed. I've made new friends there and am keeping up with my studies.

It's literally the most someone could ask for in life and I realize how privelleged I am to have this opportunity. What I don't understand is why the fuck I'm so sad. I feel like I have two separate sides in my head the miserable one and the sane side.

The miserable one isn't capable with logical thinking. Doesn't understand that each day you just gotta get through the day or week and not worry so far into the future like next year. This part of me punches it's way through the sane side with overwhelming dread, that I'll never be anything in life, that I'm a disappointment to my family and really I'm just wasting everyones time and money by being around. This side has thought about jumping off the fucking building I live on for gods sake. I don't think I would ever do it cause I'm to much of a scaredy cat to do so but it really scares me sometimes.

The sane side of me, the person who's writing this post right now thinks that miserable side should shut the fuck up and go away. There are other people in the world with it way worse than you, you are wasting the privellege you have by being sad all the time.

You see it's always been this way since I was younger but never this bloody frustrating. I'll be walking back from a cells lecture feeling good about what I've done and my brain will go "" yeah but you still haven't started that ecology report due in a month or what about the geology paper huh, your really just gonna fail this year, be a disappointment to mum and dad ( I love my parents alot they have been the best parents I could possibly ask for) and be a waste to this world"". It breaks me every time and , though I loathe to admit it, crying usually insues. 

I just want to be normal. So I'm using reddit to vent, sorry. I don't want to talk to my parents or friends cause I'll be wasting there time with some stupid whining from a teenage girl. They don't need to be concerned over some stupid hormones or first years stress I'm going through. I don't even know if this is the right place to post it cause depression is a serious mental illness and I'm just confused. I just want to know if anyone at all read through that cluster fuck of a reddit post and I just being sad and crying because I'm a spoiled brat or because there's something wrong with me."

At this point in my life, I realize that whether I wanna live or not is my choice and my choice alone.

1992,depression,Feeling hopeless,"I've been struggling with depression and anxiety since middle school and I'm now almost 30. I've been prescribed so many different meds ,it work for a bit and then stop working, I've grown tired of it. I am seeing a psychiatrist which started two years ago. I belive I've figured out my current trigger for my depression which I think its working (like the fact I have to work to get though life) I don't even feel like I'm a human when I work. I'd love to be on disability but I feel like it's useless to even try to get disability. I'd probably get answers like ""oh it's just part of life"" or ""your just being lazy"" or even ""you seem to be doing fine at work I don't see a problem"" and ""not everybody enjoy working"". I pretty much put myself in auto-pilot at work.yes I so have suicidal thoughts but I'm still able to talk myself out of it. It's just all hopeless to even try to improve my mental health.Basicly i can't find a prescription that will stay working, I feel like it's useless to even try to get disability, and to keep living a hopeless life of just mindlessly working a job while thinking of suicidal thoughts. Oh and it's also hopeless to try to improve my mental health"

1994,depression,"Yeah, but it's also gonna get worse","I hear/see a lot of people always say ""things will get better."" And yes they do, but they are also going to get worse.

After my last break down I picked my self up got some help started to make some career planning and started learning CAD. And things went really well for a bit, making a lot of progress with CAD, working on my relationship with my wife, improving relationships with friends, etc. Yet for no fucking reason, today everything feels like a waste and life is pointless yet again.

I seldom get angry or yell at others. I act like a normal person and I tell everyone I’m fine, I’m happy, there’s nothing wrong with me. I lost the desire of being understood. I told my therapist a thousand times I feel empty and meaningless and he said it’s because you are seriously ill. He doesn’t think I’m ill anymore but the feelings still exist. They are always there, inside my cigarettes, beneath my pillow, hiding in my room, staring at me. After a point I realize they will never fade away, I just get used to them, all the pain, all the thoughts of suicide, all the feelings of meaningless. They can’t hurt me anymore, I would like to say we get along well. I just feel...tired. I can feel something positive now, it’s almost a miracle for me. But also a disaster. I can’t believe amazing things happened in MY LIFE but they just happened. I try to prove they are just imagination but they are all real and the feeling of happiness is real. After feeling that I suddenly noticed how bad I feel in a common day of my life. I feel bad as hell. If I just feel the same as usual I won’t be this struggle. I try to stop overthinking but it’s still not fair,isn’t it? If I deserve a better life why I spent or WASTED so much time just getting used to that shit? Is that a useful skill to survive in this creepy world? It doesn’t make sense...look at me now I’m such an addict... I can’t live without alcohol,nicotine,and most important, quetiapine,lithium,citalopram,fluvoxamine maleate, and when I feel happy it isn’t provided by these things. I still hate myself after all this shit. I’m tired of getting tired for no reason, I’m tired of having the whole afternoon sleeping then feel tired again in 11pm. I wasted so much and just achieve a life like THIS. After wasting my time writing this shit I’m gonna write the annotated bibliography for my Economic essay."

2013,depression,i just want to fall asleep and never wake up,"i sleep rather than solving my problems. i sleep instead of going to college. i sleep instead of eating. i sleep instead of doing anything. when will i fall asleep and never wake up?

i’m a failure and i’ll never amount to anything. my dad reminds of that almost daily. i’m 17 and i only have a primary school education because depression fucked up my chances of passing my exams. my college let me in on a special chance and i’ve already fucked it up. i don’t work, i never make deadlines and on the off chance i make it, it’s never up to my teachers standards. i seriously try to think i’m doing my best but am i? i feel like i’m pushing myself just to turn on my laptop and join a lesson. recently i can’t even bring myself to do that and going back to bed. i have a meeting with my course manager soon but i know that i’m going to breakdown into tears and get angry. i can’t help it i can’t even keep my emotions in check. it’s not the first time i’ve been in trouble with her, she yelled at me before because i don’t have any friends. 

i tried ignoring my problems, i thought i could be happy if i pretended they weren’t there. it came back to bite me in the ass because i failed all five years of my secondary education. i’m failing trying to retake them. i did a lot of drugs, drank, smoked and spent a lot of money thinking it would make me feel better or at least distract me from all my pain. my friends left me after i got too depressed to do anything and now i have nothing left. the only reason i’m still here is because i love my mum dearly and i’m scared of failing in my attempt and her not looking at me the same again, it’s happened before and she still won’t look at me properly. 

my mental health team moved me to a recovery team because they don’t even want to deal with me anymore and honestly, i don’t want to deal with myself either. my medication does absolutely nothing and i’m sick of it making me even more tired and unmotivated.  i truly want to die and be at peace i seriously can’t deal with anything anymore. 7 years of depression has kicked my ass and it’s finally won. 

i lay in my room in the pitch black like i have done for the past 4 months. i don’t even want to see the outside anymore. i tried to get better. i seriously tried my best but it didn’t work. i feel even worse. 

sorry for the long post, doubt if anyone read this far but just wanted to get this off my chest. thank you &lt;3"

Everything that I go through I just choose to ignore it.

Got an F on a test? “I don’t care”

You haven’t been taking care of yourself lately... “I don’t care”

It will have been exactly a year since she broke up with me on march 6th and I'm still not over her. I'm also currently dating someone else right now but I know that I'm just gonna hurt them too because I'm utter garbage in a sewer. I'm a manipulative bastard but I've been doing it for so long that it's just natural to lie and deceive even though I know that it's horrible. No one wants to hear me and no one will. I've told my parents how much I want to end it but they don't really seem to care or they just don't understand how bad my mental state is. I want my ex back so bad but I know that she thinks of me as scum on the bottom of her shoe. I have a class with her and she can't even look at me. I pass her in the hallways and she looks right through me. I was so horrible to her so I don't blame her but that doesn't make it easier."

2025,depression,For the last 200 days of school I have not learned a single thing on my Algebra 1 class.,"I think I am just dyslexic at this point, I can't bring myself to learn the topic, and it doesn't help that all we do is algebra nation videos that are too fast and don't even go deep on the topic. Every single fucking time there is a test I have no idea what to fucking do. I feel miserable and I just want this to end."
2026,depression,I feel like there's something wrong with me.,"I feel like everybody around me doesn't care. Anytime I put myself out there and try to make new friends, it seems like people will talk to me for a few days and then slowly move on. When I try to get help with something (depression or losing weight for example) peoplewill say that they will be there to help and then disappear. I'm wondering if there's something wrong with me or if I'm just not finding the right people. I keep trying to look inward and pick out anything in my personality that might be pushing people away. And I've tried asking a few people that do know me about this situation. I haven't really gotten any answers."
2027,depression,I’ve just realized that this whole time I haven’t improved at all.,"I’ve been on a long journey through my mental battle thing but today I listed to a song that I used to listen to when I was sad and it clicked that I haven’t improved at all. Which I’ve been trying as hard as I can to for the past two years and I thought I was getting there.

But I’m still empty. I’m still so lonely. And I still hurt everyone around me. I can’t open up to anyone because I just cause more problems. I hate being alive. I hate everything. I’m in so much pain all the time and I’m nothing but a husk.

I feel like an imposter to myself. Like I’ve built up this image that I have to hold and I’m not strong enough to do it. I feel like a failure to everyone I love because I can’t support them. 

Life is a field of misery with dots of good moments that attract us to the end but it’s all pointless. In the end the only way to enjoy life is to block out the pain. To immerse yourself in a life we’re you’re blind to everything but the good, to be full of bliss. 

And I never want that to happen"

2030,depression,Why can’t I love and be loved?,Is that too much to ask for? To just feel normal in a loving relationship to not always question my sanity and the sincerity of the my partners? To not always let my insecurities and my trauma take hold and make me push away anyone that could potentially care about me. Constantly convincing myself I don’t deserve to be cherished and cared for and that everything will end up in ruin anyway. To always feel a pit in my stomach that I’m not good enough and everything will fall apart. I just wish I could be happy and content like others.

i’ve been going thru some shit with my manager being creepy towards me and this random man did a fingerwalk on my windshield and smiled at me. my fear of men is growing and every time i think about it i just want to end it because i know it’s never gonna go away. men are always going to be men and i can’t do anything about it so what’s the point of being here? why should i stay if 70% of women are assaulted and i have a high chance of being a victim? i just punched a pillow for 10 minutes and then had an anxiety attack. i was gonna smoke weed since i feel like shit but i’m not in the mood to smoke weed because i feel like shit. y’all feel?"

2036,depression,day 3,"today still sucked, but the misery laid low so i was able to enjoy myself today. i hope this spells the end of a depressive period, and just in time for me to get everything back on track. and maybe it's too the first step in teaching myself that i can live without it.

it's insidious, though. that's the first step in how it gets you again. you think ""oh i'm happy now, i can make something of my life now, i can be real now"" and then IT GETS YOU. you start doubting yourself for being unable to handle simple tasks; physical fatigue will wrack your body and mind; and then the tide sweeps you away once it comes back in.  i can't let myself be fooled into thinking i can handle everything like before. it brings me no joy but i'll be the lazy bastard it makes me into and guilts me for being, and i'll strangle it much the same way it strangles me.

how hard it'll be to be that lazy bastard once i get back into college though. education slows down for nobody i've found, and it'll punish you hard for the slightest misstep. it goes hand in hand with misery, waking up sleep-deprived and forcing yourself past your abilities to copy information day in day out. as cruel as it is to admit to myself, it takes higher priority over my own wellbeing. it's mostly the depression saying that i bet.

four days now, time to get my sleeping pattern in check. if i have any modicum of discipline, this'll be the last all nighter i pull for a long time. i'd better enjoy the sleep."
2037,depression,Help for a friend.,"My friend (33, M) is going through a tough time. He is going through a messy divorce, is living alone in a job which he doesn’t like. The place for his job is at a remote location, so not surrounded by friends or that many acquaintances. He has been having some medical issues related to his bones/joints as well. He is showing signs of depression for which I have asked him to get/seek professional help. The thing is he is not ready to accept that there is something wrong with him mentally and he is residing in a country (India) where mental health doesn’t take that much precedence. So I seek your help:
1. Suggest some books for my friend so that he could relate and understands his condition and may be get ready to seek help
2. Some good centers in India where he can go to seek said help."

2040,depression,Great... just fucking fantastic,"First my parents separate. Not divorced yet but plan on it. I get ""over it"". Still hurts like hell but I finally accepted it. My dad got a new girlfriend and I try to be as accepting as possible. I figure its a bit fast but hey people move on at different rates yada yada whatever. Then my mom breaks down a while later tells me everything about my dad and her relationship. Not going into details, all you need to know is its really bad. Fucks me up real bad but I pull myself up by the boot straps for the time being to comfort my mom cause she's in tears. I cry all night. Feel like I can't trust my dad. My mom realizes her mistake, calms me down tomorrow morning cause I was so fucked up I couldn't go to school.

Fast forward to now. Talking to my dad again good relationship but I feel awkward as hell around his girlfriend. My grandpa recently was hospitalized due to low hemoglobin count. My dad wanted to visit him and I didn't want to stick around his girlfriends house alone so I came with him and stuck around in his truck. On the ride back I ask him how he's doing and he tears up. I have only ever seen him tear up two other times in my life. When he tried to comfort me when his mom died and when I consistently was failing in school.

He tells me my grandpa won't except the blood transfusion.

He tells me he won't eat.

He tells me that my grandpa figures God will sort him out.

He tells me that he doesn't think he's gonna make it.

I play it tough and try and comfort him because thats how I was taught. It fucks me up bad. Not only has my grandpa been in the hospital two other times but the first time he was in there for two months. He just now started to get back to his original strength. Then he broke his hip and got it replaced. And now this. If he does pull through he's gonna have to rebuild from rock bottom again. My dad is the only person who can see him because of this stupid covid guideline bullshit. Not only can we not see him and show him we love him but he can't get the fucking support from us. I just want to see him before he dies but I can't. I want him to be surrounded by his loved ones to know he is loved. Even if that doesn't change his mind about the transfusion at least he'll die in the support of his loved ones.

Now fast forward to today. My dad calls me and we talk for a bit and I ask about my grandpa. He tells me his hemoglobin count is going up but his kidneys and heart are starting to get worse.

Why. Why me. Why do I have to fucking take hit after God damn hit. Then when all is said and done I don't have the fucking balls to tell anyone how its affecting me until I'm fucking breaking down. I support my mom and dad and see that it's okay to seek help from loved ones but I don't. I guess it's because I don't wanna put that burden on them but just. Fuck. I hate it."

I haven't had a weekend where I haven't drank a gallon of liquor short of being forced to because of duty obligations. I have nothing to live for and I'm tired of trying year after year and now I don't even have the people or the places in my life that made everything bearable. I constantly shut down at work.

2044,depression,Is life supposed to feel like this?,"About four months ago I finally told myself that the depression I feel is real. It isn’t made up, and it’s not fake because I had one good day. I got help and my doctor put me on lexapro, which I got up to 15mg on. I found it wasn’t helping at all and I was horribly depressed and dissociated. My life felt like a blur; days flying by while I was in the passenger seat of my own mind. So i talked my doctor and he switched me off lexapro to now 20mg Prozac. And I was really excited for this, it felt like a fresh start and maybe I could feel good. But I just don’t. It’s been weeks now. And absolutely nothing. Is this how I am supposed to feel? Is this “normal?” I feel my whole perception of reality has been wrecked and I don’t know what to do anymore."

2047,depression,My brain is turning into mush,"I posted here a few days ago talking about my recent situation, and I mentioned that I have been distracting myself by just keeping myself occupied through constant work. When I got home tonight, it dawned on me that I have been averaging non-stop 13-14 hour workdays for the last 4 weeks or more. It's the only way I have been able to keep intrusive thoughts at bay. My ears are ringing like crazy, and I can almost feel my brain liquefying. Don't know how much weight I have lost, but my pants keep sliding off my waist. The isolation working inside a windowless research lab in the basement all day, the isolation of this deserted town, the isolation inside the apartment where I live, the isolation of having no family and friends close by - it's turning me into a living zombie.


My family tell me ""prayer is the only way"". People I know tell me ""shit happens, there are other people in worse situations than you, don't worry so much"". My supervisor says ""keep working, deliver more"". To avoid appearing appearing like a whiner to all these people, nowadays I just tell them ""I am doing okay"".

I am not okay. I am pretty far from okay. There are too many uncertainties in front of me that I need to solve in a limited amount of time. Biologically I exist, but mentally I am not all there anymore. I have never felt more lonely in my life.

I don't know why I am writing all this.. Just wanted to lay it all out to strangers."

2049,depression,Needed to get this off my chest so I don’t overthink,"I don’t really know what to do anymore.. I’ve been depressed since I was 13-14 and recently my depressive episodes have gotten way worse, at the start of the pandemic I took time off of school due to not feeling like I’m meant to be a student rn.. I never liked school to begin with and being 18-19 at the time I felt like I had to go to not be embarrassed since the rest of my friends were going to the top schools but I didn’t realize college would absolutely destroy the little bit of happiness I had left.. I dropped out recently after having horrible experiences w rude teachers and students and as somebody who suffers w anxiety and social anxiety I was never a top achiever in classes or even social situations and when it came to school it just made me feel plain stupid.. the students were rude and same with the teachers and the friends I did have would just suffer with me until the weekends came and it was Time to drink or do whatever drug we could (I’m clean now) and after dropping out during the beginning of the pandemic I had hope maybe I would find something different better to do? But as the pandemic continued and I ended up living the same day over and over and over again I feel as if my life will never take a good turn, I only talk to the same 5 people and half of them I don’t really think genuinely care for me.. but I’d rather have shitty friends then be completely alone ( I know terrible mindset) All my friends come and go and it’s started to make me think.. is it my fault? I’ve never been in a relationship or anything close to that my entire life and I really want to be loved and cared for as as a young woman I can’t help but feel undesirable and not good enough..  seeing all my friends in love and My anxiety makes me feel like it’s my fault .. it seems like my life is way harder than everyone else’s and I’ve come to terms with most likely never being romantically loved by anybody and I want to live a successful happy life but as of right now it feels absolutely impossible with the life that was given to me.. I feel as if I’m suffering in silence.. helping my friends with their mental struggles and getting little to no type of support in return.. I’ve even tried to better myself and look for a job and possibly a therapist but out of all the jobs near me I’ve applied for declined me or ignored my applications &amp; I can’t find any therapist who will take me.. I feel like I’ll never get a break I’m so sick of living but I know I could never leave my mother here alone she’s the soul reason I’m still here.. I hate this life and this world so much every day I wish I could wake up on another planet or universe in a meadow not having to worry about materialistic things and just floating with the wind I apologize if this is all over the place I just needed to get it out so I’d hopefully stop thinking about it.

2050,depression,Diagnosis only made me feel worse?,"I recently got diagnosed with bipolar 2 10+ years after being misdiagnosed with “minor depression” when I was a teenager. It feels relieving to finally have a grasp on what I’ve been struggling with for so many years, while at the same time made the slump I’ve been in for a few months feel even worse. My boyfriend said he felt the same way with his diagnosis, but...idk. I am just so tired of feeling so fucking bad all the time."
2051,depression,Angry at Therapist,"Forgive me if this isn't the place for it, but I'm at my wit's end and at least need to rant.

Long story short, I never had insurance that provided mental health services, nor could I afford the high price of care. When COVID hit, my mental health dropped to an all time low and finally received care through Medicaid literally after I had already planned to kill myself. I got my therapist in October and we clicked! I was feeling better and felt that I had an outlet. In December, she informed me that she was taking a month off for a much needed vacation to visit her family. In the back of my mind, I was like, ""umm... we're in a pandemic, but cool I guess...""

I scheduled my appointment for January, only to have my appointment cancelled, due to my therapist being sick. I rescheduled for February and same thing. They placed me with another therapist for an appointment in March. I spoke with her and it was honestly the worst therapist I've ever talked to. I'm thinking maybe she doesn't specialize in depression and anxiety. 

Now, I'm at another all time low. I know my therapist will be coming back soon, but they haven't started scheduling appointments yet. 

Okay - So, this pisses me off for a few reasons. For one, she decided to risk her health during a pandemic. Two, I don't know many jobs that are cool with their workers being sick for months and it feels like we're coddling a professional that gets to work from home and simply talk to people over the phone. As someone who was let go during the pandemic, this is irritating. Third, I may be at rock bottom, but I know there are people way worse than me. I feel for them during this struggle without a therapist. We are literally so close to killing ourselves and it feels like the one person whose job is to help us is skipping out because of a sore throat.

Yes, COVID is really bad. But, if you're talking about returning to your work from home job, I'm going to assume you're doing fine and not in life threatening danger.

I feel bad for these thoughts, but I'm genuinely angry, frustrated and very very depressed/anxious. I don't know what to do except to wait until she feels like working again. Hopefully I'm still alive 👍"

I still see everything is pointless, I don’t feel anything at this point, just pain. What’s the point?

2061,depression,Why is my mom always mad at me?,"I grew up with my grandparents since both my parents lived in another place but moved to my place a few years later. I started living with my parents and I didn't like it there. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom calls me names like ""t\*nga"" or ""g\*go""\* everytime I made a mistake or forget something. She also says things about me being stupid just because I can't multiply a three digit problem in 3 seconds and whenever I want to visit my grandma's other relatives like my aunt or cousins, she would lock me in my room and threaten to cut my tongue, she also broke my wrist in 2nd grade and I had to lie to the school clinic even if I want to say that my mom broke it.

 I want to tell her that she hurts my feelings and that she can't expect me to be perfect but she always wants to be the one who's right because ""moms know best"" or something. She wants to be seen as the victim of all these things when she's the one who's been hurting me and called me words. Sometimes I just wished she wasn't my mom, I am upset that she had me at 16 years old and I don't know why she treats me like that, I already helped her with things, gave up everything to make her happy and yet she gets very mad when I accidentally make a mistake like whenever we travel, I remember one time I was around 7 to 10 years old I had to carry the luggages to the conveyer belt looking thing in the airport and she threatened to leave me in the airport if I don't hurry. 

Or whenever there's a turbulence in the plane and my food and drinks fall on me, she would secretly pinch me hard when that happens. My great-grandma also accidentally burnt my finger with a candle and obviously my reaction would be shocked but sadly my dear mom glared daggers at me for doing that reaction. What am I gonna do? Smile for burning my finger? Sorry for ranting I might sound like a jerk but...

2062,depression,I need help.," 

Short  back story, I used to drink heavily (12 or so beers per day) didn't  matter the time of day. I went to work, etc..high functioning alcoholic  for sure. Then one day I experienced my first ever panic attack, went to  the ER ... everything fine of course.

Fast  forward 3 years and I struggle with anxiety daily, but not panic. I'm  able to shop alone, go to work fine, fall asleep fine.

My issue is I can NEVER feel happy or relaxed. My anxiety attack a few years ago kickstarted some depression I feel like.

I  turn to beer, but only 2-4 cans..BUT just about daily. Not to help with  anxiety so much, but depression...boredom...maybe both? Social anxiety  for playing games? I'm a mess basically.

My  question, what can I do to help feel more relaxed and not so paranoid  for no reason. Any herbal teas or anything? I want to avoid medicine  because I feel like I'm not at a severe level for that, but I also want  to avoid beer. Sorry I have been drinking so this post may be all over  the place."

2065,depression,My reason not to became the only reason i wanted to,"I was in a really close knit group. But one of the people in the group was my absolute best friend. She was like a sister to me. She knew and knows me better than anyone. I told her everything, she told me everything. We spent almost every single day together and I’ll say until i die that i made my best memories with her. Last summer i had to go away. I was in a really really bad place and basically stopped taking to everyone, started SH, and would sit in bed for days without eating or drinking.  I’ve struggled with mental health in the past, but for some reason this was different. She helped me through it, texting and listening. The only reason i didn’t act on my daily suicidal thoughts was because I knew she would never forgive herself and I didn’t want to ruin her. for that i owe her my life. Anyways fast forward to a few months ago, to make a long story short she had apparently been sharing my personal details with people to make fun of me. She went around telling people i was crazy and fragile and a compulsive liar. Said some other really horrendous stuff too. I didn’t believe it but I saw screenshots snd proof first hand. When i confronted her she just tried to make me feel guilty for being angry. I sobbed for days trying to figure out what to do. I didn’t want to lose her but I needed to for once in my life choose ME first. I cut her off. I had to. But I’m a darker place than i’ve ever  been now. I have other friends i’m not like a loner but the pain just hurts so deep that i’ve kind of distanced myself from everyone again. I barely feel anything anymore. Rooms a mess. Barely showing up for school. No motivation to do assignments.  I never thought she would do this to me. I don’t know how to trust anyone. I don’t know what I did wrong. I feel like a joke. And as someone with low self esteem, i can’t help but internalize all of the things she said about me. I mean she knows me best, right? I wish i could have been better."

2067,depression,Today is the first time I truly came to terms with the fact that I am depressed.,"For a long time I knew I had been going through a “rough patch” life isn’t perfectly polished. I feel grateful that as a 23 year old I have already been aware of that for a long time. These past 4 or 5 years have just felt different. Everything I have ever enjoyed has suddenly become a chore. I feel incapable of keeping up with my responsibilities only brings me down more. Suicide feels like a more and more viable and peaceful option every day. But worst of all, I. Can’t. Sleep. Forever I figured “such is life” and “part of becoming and adult”until today when something inside of me clicked. After a bit of research that eventually led me here I have come to the realization that, while I am no doctor, I experience a rather long list of things that all point towards being mentally ill. It still feels weird because I never considered myself to be familiar with this. I’m still not familiar with this but it feels good to begin to recognize that this isn’t how life should be."

I know generally I'm not really behind, but I feel so behind in terms of finding what I actually want to do with my life. I need an internship but I have no idea what I want to do so I don't even know what to apply for. I feel like I know nothing about my own major too, which makes it even harder to find out what I want. Thinking about it scares me because I just know that I am going to have to figure out what I want to do at some point in order to have a future, but I just keep putting it off because I don't want to face that. I have a part-time job and work 24 hours a week but other than that, I just sit in my room all day, occasionally going out to eat (which is always shitty fast food). I have no confidence in myself and I just beat myself up nonstop and I want to stop but I feel that I deserve whatever thoughts come to me. I feel like I have dug myself into a hole and I have no idea how to get out. I know I have to fix things myself in order to get out of this but I just keep pushing it off because I have 0 motivation. One day I feel fine and content, but the second I start thinking about this, I go back into this hole that is really hard to get out of. For the record, I have recently started weekly therapy in the past month, but I feel I'm not doing what I need to have any change. I haven't done laundry in about a month and I can't bring myself to it even though I know it would make me feel better if I could just do that. I am full of bad habits that I don't know how to break out of.

Well that's all I have to say. Maybe someone will read this but it's likely it will get lost in the rest of the posts. It just feels good to get it out and say whatever I want. Hello if you are reading this"

Anybody experienced loss of inner voice while depressed? I can’t read anything silently and hear myself subvocalize. It has been like this for five months since I withdrew from law school after a month of enrollment.  Anybody with helpful advice is greatly appreciated."
2072,depression,Living is more painful than death,"I just attempted suicide last night. Drank a lot of pills. And what did I get? Nausea and stomache pain. Cant believe Im alive and that didnt work. Im tired living. I have no motivation. No future. No goals. Nothing. My schoolmate just died last week because of myocarditis and I cant help myself but ask ""Why her? Why not me?"". She has a lot of goals in life. An active student. Yet she died. And what about me? I cant even stop thinking of killing myself. I hate living. I wish I was never been born."

2074,depression,"Seeing other people being productive and bettering themselves doesn’t inspire me, it makes me feel worse","Logically I know I have nothing to lose by trying to exercise, read a book, etc. I don’t even have a good reason as to why I don’t do it. Best I can come up with is that I simply don’t have the energy, and I’ve lost so much hope that my future will turn around that I wonder why I would even want to get better? Like what’s the point? But I know deep down that being productive will distract from this misery and might as well have a nice body and learn a new skill while I’m on this rock. Seeing my brother having his shit together and doing everything I want to do is really discouraging. The old me would take it as a challenge, I’d strive to be the “successful” sibling and would work harder. Now I just accept that everybody is always gonna like him better and be more impressed with him so why bother trying? I guess it’s a prime example of learned helplessness. But it’s not benefitting me at all. I just always feel like if I try and then fail, I’ll end up feeling even worse about myself. It’s almost better to be stuck in my depressive episodes than to have a few good days and immediately fall off."
2075,depression,I'm (18/M) a freshman in university. I hate my life.,"I need some serious advice. I'm a freshman in a pretty well respected university in Canada. I hate every aspect about my life right now. I know being online isn't a good representation of how university really is, but I've always hated school. 

I’ve had one previous depressive episode where a psychologist concluded that I had mild clinical depression. It was after having to retire early from hockey at 16 y/o due to injury. I had loved hockey and might have had a future in. It was heartbreaking and I went through some really awful times. 

In high school I wasn't a good student. I had good grades, but I did the absolute bare minimum to be considered a participating student, and I don't think I studied for more than one or two exams for all of high school. I was fortunate enough to get good grades without having to try. 

Now in university, I'm doing well in in three of my classes, and doing poorly in my fourth. There are classes I can tolerate more than others, but **I hate everything to do with academia and school in general.** Shitty and rude professors, cocky class mates, uninteresting classes that aren’t motivating. It seriously makes me feel physically sick when I think of school, and I'm not exaggerating that. I don't understand how people can do 4+ years of this. It makes me feel dumb, unimportant and overlooked. I have nothing fulfilling in my life right now. 

I’ll be completely honest, I’ve began smoking weed a lot more. I don’t let it get in the way of my schoolwork, but it’s the only way I can escape at the end of the day after a tough day of classes/studying. It’s kind of worrying me considering I only smoked weed on occasion with friends and now it’s become a habit. I could just drop out, but I really want a financially successful future. I'm not talking about billionaire rich, but I've seen what having to worry about money has done to people. I don't ever want to worry about money in my life. University, to me, seems like the main way to attain this (at least to me). 

I should also mention the family I come from. My parents didn't force me to go to school, but it was expected of me. My dad has a B.A and an MBA and my mom has a B.A and BFA. They're both well educated individuals, and expected me to follow suit. Also, I'm lucky to have a college fund that my dad started. He has nearly 100k in there between my brother and I. That's a fuck ton of money to devote to someone, only for them to not use it. I don't want to disappoint them. I don't want to rely on them forever. I want to own a house someday. I want to afford to take a nice vacation every once in a while. But, I don't see how I can survive this for another 4+ years. It's mentally torturing me. The stress and anxiety I feel around exams is crippling. The rest of the time is pure anhedonia. 

I plan on finishing my first year at the very least. I've made that promise to myself and my parents and I plan to follow through on it. After that, I don't know what I'm going to do. I really need some guidance right now. Anything can help.

Thank you Reddit."
2076,depression,What's the point,"I mean that in a serious way, not a cliche. I don't understand the point of carrying on when my life sucks this bad. Like I would much rather have eternal nothingness than this life that I'm living right now. Everybody says that it gets better but they've been saying that forever and it hasn't. I think I'm done."
2077,depression,Don’t know what to do at this point.,"This is my first time posting on Reddit but I feel as if I finally need to get this off my chest and possibly seek help. Some details about myself, I am a teenager, divorced parents, no friends, nothing to do all day.

I’m not going to say I have depression because I have not been diagnosed yet but each day it seems to get keep getting worse and worse. I have no more motivation or drive for anything, including school. I know that not graduating would limit my future greatly but I just can not find any tiny speck of drive to attend school. Some days I feel normal, recently I’ve been having waves of sadness and suicidal thoughts. 

With the recent COVID restrictions (currently living in California) it has gotten almost 10x worse. I don’t know what to do at this point. I know that if I let this go on I will end up dead at some point. Sorry for the shitty writing I’m not used to jotting my thoughts and feelings onto a page."
2078,depression,A sad realization,"I was watching Big Bang Theory and this episode had Burt the geologist in it. He said something that stuck with me. He said “I don’t have dreams, asleep or in life.” It hit me hard. I realized I never have either. I wasn’t raised to be a dreamer. I was raised to work. Never pushed to reach for the stars or even for a hobby. Never encouraged for any of it. Just work. Get a skill and work. Or go to the military. I’ve always lived for others. I have no hobbies. No dreams. No aspirations. I just go with the motions. It’s a terrible feeling. I’m not passionate about anything. I don’t have a single thing I’m great at. I have interest in so many things but it quickly dies. I just don’t know how to overcome this. I feel like I failed at life completely. I love the American Dream and I’m not happy. Home ownership sucks, I live to pay bills, and can’t stand the suburbs. Did it all for my wife. I love her so much, but I could lose everything else in life and not be phased. I feel like I’m just waiting to die. I’m ready for it. Like sooner the better in my opinion. Fuck it. Not suicidal. Just not excited to wake up every day. Not excited for anything anymore. I feel like an empty shell. Like I just exist. What’s the point anymore?"
2079,depression,the thoughts won’t stop,"for a while i didn’t have any thoughts, but they came back a couple days ago. and can’t fall asleep without them ringing in my ear. i keep telling myself that i’m ugly and better off dead. i’m so tired i can’t keep living like this. i’m afraid i’m not good enough and that i’m too much. that in too anxious, obnoxious or just boring. i feel worthless and that i don’t deserve anything. i have to wake up early for work tomorrow but i can’t close my eyes without this heavy pit on my chest. so much sadness. i’m tired of pretending and trying to hard to keep it together. so much guilt and trauma that’s still unaddressed and it’s so fucked. sorry this isn’t well written i’m too tired but god i just wanna give up and hurt myself but ik i won’t idk"
2080,depression,Well I'll be damned,"I'm in my 20s now. I'm balding. I work full time for the federal government. I'm fat, I fell into a deep depression not too long ago and haven't done anything but work since. I'm starting a new medication because I need energy again and I've been on zoloft for years but it hasn't done anything for me.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that walking up from rock bottom is not easy. It will take years. Luckily if you have nothing you still have some time."

2082,depression,Tired of being tired,[deleted]
2083,depression,I will never be fine.,"I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for 4 years. Largely due to my parents. I'm fine with being an only child, in fact, I wish I would've been normal if that makes sense. My mom is emotionally abusive and my dad just ignores it. I have been to a psychiatric ward before, group therapy, and therapy. It worked until quarantine happened and school started up. Both my parents are Asian immigrants and obviously looking for me to be better than what they wanted to do.

My dad signed me up for an SAT class that I never wanted to attend and when I spoke up both parents thought I wanted to do the class and ignored my feelings. When the class started to offer in-person session, I sat there in class doing a practice and my stomach started to hurt for 3 hours. My stomach repeatedly hurts when I go outside now, I'm even afraid of going outside. I may have agoraphobia or just PTSD from my stomach hurting. When I signed up to go back to school as well, I thought it was over and my stomach started acting up again--but this isn't about my anxiety.

I've been losing motivation for over a month or two, not doing work, almost failing my classes, and ditching classes. The school mailed us a notice that if I skipped anymore classes we would get charged. My parents made a big deal out of this and my mom even came over 2 times just to yell at me for things like not going outside with them, not going anywhere in general and now I'm skipping classes and she hopes I have a labor intensive work to understand why my parents pay so much tax money just to have me skip classes. 

There's a form you have to fill out if you want your child to atten school 4 days a week, and my dad asked for my student ID and I gave it to him. I think he might've signed me up for that. But when my mom came in to give me a yelling, I yelled back and asked them if they wanted me to have a panic attack in school because of my anxiety and my dad yelled back, ""YES!"" All angry. I emailed my counselor to ask if he can change me back to remote again.

I know this is a long text and is a mess. I tried to turn into a ghost Monday, if you catch my drift. I feel like a shell of my former self. I used to be so happy, but I feel like my parents ruined me.

I'm looking for advice or someone to talk too. Either would be appreciated."

usually I don't really care but it really hurt bc he gave me birth uk? idk that definitively sucked, ouch."

2091,depression,How can we love if all we experience is hate?,"I hate myself. I hate people for not understanding me. People hate who I am (my family specifically because I'm not a happy person). I am the definition of a scrooge.

I've been reading about religion and how to answer to our fears is to love. And I like that philosophy but... I can't. There's only hatred around me. All the people who have abandoned me. I don't feel love and I feel it's impossible to display something that I've never felt. 

Does a solution exist?"
2092,depression,I don’t deserve to be alive,I’ve done to many mistakes in my life where to the point where I know the next day is going to start off as a bad day. Earlier today I have made a very bad sin to the point where I felt so terrible that my head started spinning and I felt like I was going to pass out. I have no self discipline I understand that I need to work things out. But I’ve always tried to take the easy ways through life and I’m currently thinking that the easy way to get rid of my problems is to die.
2093,depression,feeling kind of numb,"I don’t know how best to describe it but i guess i just wanted to see who can relate. 17 F and i have a boyfriend and amazing friends and family. They’re great and i love them but when they say heart warming things to me i just don’t feel anything from it, it doesn’t really give me joy or anything and i feel like i fake it. An example is if my boyfriend says ‘I love you’ or other heartwarming stuff i feel like i’m only saying it back because i have to, and that’s the same with all my friends and family, all my social interactions feel forced and i don’t feel joy from it. Just wanted to see if any related because it sucks having good people around me and not feeling anything"
2094,depression,everything in my life goes wrong,"I know I will never accomplish anything. Everything I do goes wrong, has a mistake; I can never get it right. I feel like no matter what, I'm always trapped in this endless cycle of shit going wrong. I'm prone to getting over-hyped and it doesn’t mix well with my bad luck. I always get excited for things to happen, but I soon learn it won’t because I've been lied to, or it's just not possible for a person with my luck. I've already learned this, and i try not to get over excited, which keeps me more depressed, but it doesn’t hurt as bad when things unsurprisingly don't go my way. I try to tell myself to not get overhyped when things are looking up, but I always fail. I want to put trust in this world and the people around me, but then I am once always let down.

Because of the way my life is, my mind has become so messy. My thoughts are so cluttered and confusing I can’t figure it out myself. I’m not even sure what i'm truly feeling. I barely know who I am.

Maybe im blind or pessimistic, but I have yet to see improvement in the last several years. Even when I look bad to middle school, I can remember the start of me becoming aware, and shit slowly only got worse. Maybe my life was just as bad before then too, and I was just not yet aware, or didn’t recognize it. Several years later and still all I've felt is pain and struggle. Maybe it's confirmation bias and I want things to get worse, though I don't see why I would want that. I don’t see how I would ever want something new making my life worse by the hour. Somehow there is always something bad to happen to me. I'm honestly impressed by the stuff the universe pulls out on me. I've been in so many unfortunate situations. There are days so much happens to me, stuff people won’t experience in months. Or maybe that's not true, and people don’t open up to me. But when I look around everyone else is happy, and leaves me out, and cannot relate to anything I feel. I'm stricken with immensely bad luck. I beg that just one thing goes right in my life. However, my life keeps changing so fast, but always in the wrong direction and it's becoming impossible to keep up.

Being alive makes me feel physically sick. It makes me want to throw up, it gets me dizzy to the point I feel like I'm going to pass out. The impossible situations I'm put in only make it worse. It's the worst feeling in the world knowing you don’t have a chance. It's why I can’t make a decision for myself, I always seem to choose the wrong option. I never meant to make the wrong decision or take the wrong path. It's like I ruin everything myself but I’m set up into the situation and have no other choice.

I just can’t seem to get anything in my life. I don't have clear skin or nice hair, or any good looks. I’m not athletic or smart, though I try, I still always fail. I don’t get anything else I would want. I don’t want everything. I just want one thing to go right. Just one thing. I wish i was fucking normal. I’m so disgusted with myself and who I am. I don’t even get to choose who I am. I feel stuck in the body with the thoughts I have, but I don’t agree or want them. It doesn’t feel like me."
2095,depression,Lately I have been spending a lot of time thinking. Mostly about how no one seems to care about me as much as they care about others.,"In the past few years my sister has become more and more depressed and anxious. But the difference between me and her is that people come flocking to her to help. What happens when I get depressed or even suicidal? Nothing. 

Back when I was in school I would stab myself with pencils, scrape my skin off on brick walls, dismantle pencil sharpeners for their blades, and cut myself with anything sharp I could get my hands on. I would often do so while in class. Nobody gave a shit. My teachers would tell me not to but they never did anything about it. I cried every other day and spent more time acting like a lifeless shell than I should have. I hid in the stairwells for multiple class periods at a time. I refused to eat lunch. I was bullied goddamn constantly! I saw people who bullied me getting help from counselors, but I rarely even got approached by them.

My parents didn’t care very much either, they refused to acknowledge what I was doing to myself and even guilted me for it.

Oooooooh, but my sister has ONE breakdown at ONE school dance and everyone is convinced she’s going to go home and kill herself! Now, listen, I understand that my sisters mental health is just as important as mine but..... wtf

They called the fucking cops, over teenage drama! She wasn’t in danger! She was just upset because she saw a girl she didn’t like hanging out with one of her friends! She cried ONCE. And everyone lost their shit! 

I never got any fucking help. I felt so abandoned. I’m the least favorite child.


I feel so stupid for complaining about something small like this, but I just needed to let it out so I could actually stand a chance of getting any sleep tonight. This all happened a few years ago and I might be complaining about nothing."
2096,depression,i don't feel good anymore,"hey i couldn't find any other place to say this so i decided to try here i just turned 18 uhhh most of my life i was always told that my mind was very mature for my age idk if thats true who cares but my reason is because ive always felt like that when i would try to talk to someone they could never relate to what i was talking about for example i recently started to talk to my mom about stuff but she doesn't know n thinks im too mature for her...... ik how that sounds but i wonder who can i talk to if even my own mom dosen't seem to understand. if your wondering no i can't talk to my dad he passed last year in March my mom never let me see my dad growing up but around 2019 i was able to live with my dad due to my mom getting caught selling meth.....it was such a good year i was so happy to finally meet him n be with him but sadly some dude on meth had a vendetta against him n shot him my family on my dads side thinks my uncle mike set my dad up to get killed. during the funeral i didn't cry i felt sad but i couldn't cry like everyone else idk why. the way my family works there's two sides my moms family n my dads family for the longest time they weren't too fond of each other n growing up each side would always tell me bad things about one another i never knew who to believe so i tried not to. im 18 now n i don't feel much toward anyone anymore i don't know why or when i started feeling like this..... i hate it but ig thats life huh i sometimes want to love my mom but its hard my pops told me that my mom got an abortion but i survived somehow crazy huh yeah ik i couldn't believe it when he told me that now i can't look at my mom the same i still love her but its just different. i have never tried to commit suicide and i have never cut i only smoke weed for comfort sometimes some shrooms n cid but sometimes i really think about how it would be if i wasn't here. most of the time i just want to disappear n wish no one ever knew me.........my dream for as long as i can recall was to always leave everything behind friends, family, my old life. im not sad to where i cry about it everytime i talk about it but at the same time im not happy with things like i used to. i really love video games mortal kombat 9 n cod black ops 2 were always my favorites but when i play games now i can't find the joy i had years ago is that weird? any way just wanted to post this n see if i can get some people to talk about how ive been feeling. hope y'all have a good day n take care of yourself"

2098,depression,Never have I flipped so fast,[deleted]
2099,depression,I feel nothing.,"So I'm at the point where I don't even feel sad. I don't cry anymore or anything. But I don't feel anything at all like, it's worse than feeling sad. I even cut myself a lot a couple of minutes ago just to see if  I would cry when I cut myself as I used to. I have never cut myself so many times and I didn't feel anything. Of course, it hurt, but afterward, It was as if I didn't even do it in the first place. 

Feeling nothing sometimes makes me think I fake my depression. Am I?

It's as if I put my feeling on pause. Like I still have breakdowns, but they last like 5 mins, then I go back to my emotions turned off. 

Do you think I fake my depression?"

2101,depression,Addiction to self harm,"I'm addicted to cutting and hurting myself... I feel like I'm alone and in pain every day and hurting myself is the only thing that gives me relief. I've tried meditation, exercise, more than a decade of therapy, medication, I've been addicted to drugs but I always return to cutting myself... My arm is covered in scars and I can't wear t-shirts. I started cutting my leg because it's easier to hide/forget and I like how it feels. Sometimes I starve myself for days and punch myself in the face too... I've been abused constantly my whole life and I feel like I deserve it. It distracts me from how I'm feeling inside"
2102,depression,Life feels like it's on autopilot,"Feels like life is just going how it's all supposed to be, predetermined, in truth there's very little you can do beyond what people expect of you. You cannot simply take a break form this life, it is constantly moving forward at the same rate. 

It happens around you and there's little decisions you can make every now and then but overall the majority of human life is decided by a handful of the population, what you wear, eat, drive, watch, read, is permitted to you through chance by the people in control."

2104,depression,Even my incentives for not wanting to be depressed are shallow,"I don't want people to see me as weak and vulnerable, I don't want to connect to them, it scares me. I wish I didn't feel like this so I could be the person I try to portray to others, happy and confident, it's a lie."
2105,depression,It's all a big joke 😜 now,"I'm at a stage in my deep severe depression that's it's just a fucking joke to me now. Like I've accepted a lot of things and I know that I won't and cannot change them. I feel like if I had not been so self aware and so hyperactive about the things I do and decisions I make that I could've easily become a school shooter. I kid you not. I'm still severely depressed and lonely but I've accepted it now, and sort of have my darkest negative time line 10 yr view. Like I know where I'm headed and I'm fine with it. I know I'm too damaged to be repaired and that I'll never find anyone ever. Even if I do, I'll fuck it up but that's ok because I know who I am, why I am and where I am going. It's very bitter sweet in a way."
2106,depression,sigh,how tiresome it is dealing with this depression and wanting to suicide.. to the next life.
2107,depression,Question regarding depression and school,"I applied for a scholarship i really need, but my mental health is really bad right now and I might end up needing to admit myself to a hospital. Would my professors/the department i am applying to for my scholarship finding out about this affect my chances of getting a scholarship? I'm really nervous about this, so I am considering a hospital admission a no-go because I really need this opportunity."
2108,depression,Love,"I went and got into a binge of watching cry-worthy videos since I haven't cried in a very long time. I came acrossed videos of people giving free hugs to people and the genuine videos of people expressing love to strangers made me feel so happy but at the same time.. depressed. I can't remember the last time I've had a sincere hug from anyone. I don't know what even a simple touch of love feels like. I've always thought I was okay with just being alone but seeing this makes me happy and sad. I wish I could just get a hug, even from a stranger. Damn virus.."
2109,depression,I'm so tired.,"I am so emotionally tapped out. I'm tired of remote learning and dealing with my kids bickering, keeping up the house, a husband that is just completely detached from it all and has headphones on all the time. My son has decided he doesn:t want to do anything more for his adhd and apparently his 9 year old self will just figure it out - fine, whatever. My daughter is a fucking jerk that fights me over everything and throws a fit when I tell her to shut off YouTube and do her work. The kids go into school two days a week and that got cancelled this week because of snow and I'm just... done. Part of me just wants to wander off into this snowstorm and go freeze to death in the woods or something. I just need a break and I'm never going to get it because there's no family nearby and no one's going to help me. I've been battling depression and anxiety for so long, gone through so many meds, and I hate that so much of my sanity is dependent on getting away from the kids. I hate that I have to drug myself to sleep and that typing this is painful because I gnawed all my nails off again. If I do have nails I just pick at myself and I'm so tired of being broken yet expected to hold all the shit together.

Sorry about the rambling, just having a self pity session before the sleeping med kicks in. Thanks for reading my rambling."
2110,depression,I hope anyone see this,"Recently i really don't want to do anything even the stuff i like , Even the time i go out with my friends I don't be happy like i always was , i stay in bed so much , don't eat well , have exams soon and i hate college so i maybe won't study , i really don't do anything in my life just wasting it ....

- so i hope any therapist talk to me or anyone really because i can't bare it anymore , so if any therapists wanna contact me i don't have money so sorry for that 

- thank you for reading and have a nice day"
2111,depression,I think i just ruined my friendship with her cuz i loved her.,"Ever since my last post, things haven’t really gotten better at all.

She hasn’t seem to be interested in talking to me at all and i think i made her think that she’s my girlfriend when that was not my intentions.
Yes i do love her, and if i could i would date her in an instant. 
But i understand that she doesn’t like me back like that.
I commented on a post with a caption on the lines of “imagine duo queuing and calling it a date” and i wrote down “i miss doing this with her sm”.
She saw the comment and understandingly, thought i was talking about her. 
But in reality it was the last gf i had which we played a lil bit sometimes.
Anyways she confronted me after me msging her and saying sorry for watever i done, and she told me that she gets bad vibes from me cause i tend to get sad sometimes when we duo queue.
It’s true i do get sad alot and sometimes i cant help it. 
She said that she doesn’t want me to make her the girlfriend figure of my life.
I didn’t intentionally made her that but it still kinda hurted.

After that we had some small talk bout stuff and everything just doesn’t sit right with me.

Now i’m in a hole where i feel like i won’t be able to talk to her anymore without making it awkward. Or she won’t talk to me much or at all anymore.

I get anti depressants tommorow but this stuff is getting me so depressed. 
I also started cutting a couple days ago and idk, i’m a breaking point where sometimes life just isn’t worth it anymore.
The one person that i love with all my heart can’t stand me anymore and i hate myself for being such a piece of shit.
I hope her the best and all though, she’s still my favorite person to talk to.

Idk what to do in life, can’t imagine her bein gone from my life. All cause of a stupid fucking comment"
2112,depression,i do not feel a thing anymore,"life is meaningless and i live just to go to work and drink and smoke myself to death while i get fatter and older. i’m either disassociating or anxiously talking to myself, can’t get over my internal fears that my loved ones will all grow tired of me and leave me behind. i keep thinking of killing myself, i know ultimately nothing would change if i was gone, and that makes me feel even more numb. i barely have the motivation to get out of bed every morning, i’ve been calling out of work more and more because i dread just waking up and driving to work and having to do it all over again. i feel so lost."
2113,depression,I want to cut myself,I did something super embarrassing the other day and I feel like I deserve to inflict pain on myself. It's not like anybody even cares about me right....and I never even enjoy my life because I am just emotionally incapable of expressing myself and I am just so awkward...no wonder why people don't get along with me. I just hate everything and everything hates me which is only fair right? So why not..just..make it more painful
2114,depression,I dont know whats wrong with me.,"Im only 15. Im so young, I have so much life left to live. I havent even gotten out of highschool yet, but honestly, I cant see myself getting out of highschool. Im young, but there are so many things that I feel and I dont understand. I think I have depression. My mother has depression and alot of other more complicated mental disorders, this has always had an influence on my tought process about depression but I think its more than that. I feel like I am constantly fighting my own mind. There are things I should be doing but dont do, and it always leads to making myself upset or other upset. I find it almost impossible to do any work, and its been like this for years. Even now, im writing this instead of doing a huge peice of work tahst due in the morning. I stay up late everynight because id rather be stuck in this day forever than face the next day and everything that comes with it. I cant cry anymore. I dont cry at sad things. I hold all my emotions in until they expode out all at once. Ive been doing all my life. Recently its been really bad, but instead of exploding its like they just keep getting held in and then every night all i can think about is every single bad emotion thats built up. Things arent going too good right now. A familt friend of mine just recently took their own life. My mother is never giong to be able to work again, my grandmother is dying from cancer and its really reall bad. My dad lost his job and is loosing his mind. He has become angry and very, very sad. I almost feel like he may go back to drugs or drinking. Everything is building up inside me again but it wont go out. Its weighing me down, its hurting me, I dont know how to tell my parents, its so, so hard. But throuhg all of this I feel like im lying to myself. I keep thinking that all of this thought about depression is all in my head, that so what that life sucks, but I dont know anymore. Everytime I have to get up and go to school, I act happy and try to be funny for my friends. But when I get home it like it all slowly unfolds, and then by the time I should be sleeping its unbearable. And all I want to do is cry, i want to cry, and cry, and scream, and breakthings, and throw my phone against the wall and smash my computer and everything I worked hard for cause I dont care. I want it to stop. I dont care about anything but my stupid computer anymore. I dont care about school, about myself, not even my friends. But does it even matter? Tonight Ill stay up late as possible so I dont have to face tommorow. Then ill have to get up and go to school and explain how i didnt finish my work because I couldnt even gather an ounce of motivation over two fucking weeks to even start. And then ill go home and everything will just happen again in a cycle. I dont know what to do. It hurts. I hate it so, so much. I dont know whats wrong with me, or if im just saying i have a problem but am just lying to myself. I feel hopeless. I feel empty. I feel like I wont make it through life like this. It's horrible. Everytime i feel sad it just goes away after it gets horribly painful. Like it was never there, like i forget what i was upset about. Thats why i dont know if im lying to myself. I dont know what to do. I am going to find some way to miss school tommorow, the problem is that i can either lie to my parents or be honest. Maybe show them this. But I dont think it will help. Beacause I cant just not go to school. I just wish I could go to some doctor or be releived of everything untill i get this figured out. But I know that will never happen. God help me please, I cant take this anymore."
2115,depression,Planning a peaceful exit,"After battling with increasingly deep depression and crippling anxiety for the last four years, coupled with PTSD from two years working in conflicts in the middle east, I've decided to let it go. The thought of having to endure forty or fifty more years of the constant slog of trying to just scrape by and make money just seems like a particularly awful kind of slavery I no longer want to be chained to. And weirdly there is a unique sense of calm and comfort in having come to this decision. I can live out the last few months as I please, using what's left of my savings to enjoy my remaining time on my terms. The hardest part of this is knowing the deep and everlasting pain that I will leave with my family and others after I pass, I can only hope that they will know that after years of anguish, I will finally be at peace."
2116,depression,I've been a emotional toilet my whole life.,People have been shitting there evil sick emotions onto me my whole life and everyone who has abused me are considered good people and everybody loves them while I'm considered evil and everyone gets off on abusing me still.

2117,depression,Hi just stopping by,[removed]
2118,depression,the only things keeping me alive right now,the only thing keeping me alive is a few people that have no idea i exist and the thought that my parents would have to tell my friends and my coach who would have to tell my teammates what i did to myself... just thinking about their reactions makes me uncomfortable
2119,depression,How do I keep going?,"Everyday I try to find happiness. Sometimes I even succeed, but only for a minute. After the happiness I go back to feeling empty. I laugh and smile, but always wonder if they are real. I can have a seemingly great day and start laughing, but remember the cloud over my head and stop. I always make sure no one notices just to keep them at ease and not being them down with me.

Every night I feel everything. I think about everything. I cry about everything. Some nights are worse than others. I think about what I'm going to do in the future. Why I always feel alone. Why I always feel the need to compact my feelings during the day. Why I don't trust anyone near me enough to tell them how I feel. 

Maybe it's because I fear the disappoint that will rise behind their eyes. Maybe it's because I fear how they will treat me after. Maybe it's because I fear what words will come out of the mouth.

I guess I'm just not worthy of love or having someone who understands me."
2120,depression,"My family ruined my life, and i feel empty","Hi, im a 15 year old boy who  already wants  to die
I think my family hates me. My mom is a teacher,  so she really values my education, but, I duffer from ADHD ,and even with mediciny I dont succed in school, i just get easily distracted. Since I was 8, se begun to treat me as a failure, constantly telling me she would not sustain a lazy bastard, every single day for the last 7 years. My father is an asshole. He divorced my mom and took my dog away, leaving my household brokem. He after getting divorced was arrested for a week after drugging himself with a girlfriend(who he was cheating on my mom with) and she died. I hate my sister. She walks all over people. My grandfather spend the last 2 years of his life begging for her to visit and she did not care. He litteraly offered her a car, but she refused. There is not much else in my family. My grandmother is a racist. She openly hates black people and gays. My grandfather is dead, and so are my other grandma and grandpa. Amd my uncle lives outsude the country. And my shitty family life would not be so bad if I had friends. Over the last 4 years I have tried to create a group of frienda, only to be treated like shit and se it fall apart. Two guys isolated themselfs and dont interact with us. Another 2 got in other groups. All thats left is me and an asshole who semse of humour is picking a person and being shitty to them. But he is all thats left. Over the last year I hurted myself weekly. I have beeing diagnosed with ansiety and begun taking medicine., but since my dad arrest, i pretty much gave up, I wake up and stay more than one hour criyng in bed. I go to sleep hoping I dont wake up. I feel empty. Like, i dont want to keep going, but i dont want to be a distirbence in peoplw lifes, and i fear that will happen if i off myself. I will move to my dads house. My mom is terrible for me. She treats me like shit. She acts like i am a fuckin lazy fatass who cant do shit, and im afraid she is turning me into exactly that, i need help, sorry for long post, just needed sonewhere to open up.

2124,depression,I've gained 50 pounds (and forced positivity),"I'm not a healthy person. Or at least, I haven't been for the last three years. When I was in high school I developed an eating disorder that nobody knew about except me. I would eat 400 calories a day. I was so scared of the ""freshman 15"" for college, but antidepressants, bipolar meds, three years of just heartbreak and loss and sadness that I can't stave off have taken their toll. 

I'm in a better place now. I'm okay. It's possible. It's just that every day my body is a reminder of everything I have gone through and how stupid I am to have let myself go before many of my peers. I have stretch marks and scars and fat in places where I used to be able to see bone. And I can't get that stupid beauty ideal of being a skeleton out of my head.

I just can't see a future where I don't look in the mirror and hate the person I see back. Whats even worse is all the people preaching that I should ""love my body"" and that I'm ""so brave for being so body positive"" and the like. I like that I can make people feel better about themselves but it's all such a big sham.

Like I know nothing matters except how I perceive myself, but the constant familial jabs and just *EVERYTHING* about being online and having to duck out of pictures so I don't have to see myself is just exhausting.

TL;DR my problems are dumb and I should just eat less and move more"
2125,depression,My “best” friend is angry at me,"She’s going to a funeral on Saturday and she asked if I could cover her shift but I told her I couldn’t bc I’m losing my mind and I’m not ok at all to the point I can hardly brush my teeth and that I just desperately need a day to get my shit together. And then she said that was really fucked up and hurtful of me.... I’m sorry but YOUR job is not MY responsibility. I’m so fucking sorry that I want to take time to TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. I never get a fucking break, it’s always school then work school then work. I put in so much fucking effort for her. I don’t think she realizes how much I do for her. She didn’t even offer to cover one of my shifts for me if I were to take hers. I’m just so frustrated"

2132,depression,living is too much work,"I wake up with physical pain in my chest every day that I have to get out of bed to go to the job I hold high contempt and dread for. I keep looking back to the past in hopes that maybe it'll come back; not because it was actually great, but because it was much better than the present before me. Every little difference in someone's tone or actions towards me is enough to send me spiraling for days, if not weeks. I want to just drop everything and take off somewhere but I lack the money, resources, and the courage to do so. If I were normal, I keep telling myself, then I wouldn't have these problems. I wouldn't hate my family, I wouldn't worry if my friends hate me. I wouldn't be weighing the little options I have: kill myself or run away and start over. I'm tired of being like this with no change. I'm tired of redundant days where I persuade myself to get up and be alright as if obligatory self-hype was any better than being unable to look in the mirror most days without a lump in my throat. I want things to change but I am afraid they will never get better. I want to change, but I am afraid it will always be this way."
2133,depression,Feeling inadequate and fed up,"To wrap the whole story in a ball..my high school sweetheart (of 13 years now) has decided he MAY want to be female, also may not. He has a severe addiction to trans porn (but he literally just watches it like it's tv and then will sleep or do something else). 

I'm knee deep in nursing school, have my entire family constantly saying it's stupid, or they make snarky comments about how long it's taking me. I pay all out of pocket, and have two small kids, so I only take as many classes as I can afford that semester. 

I feel inadequate and horrible about myself, due to the school comments and my husband's preference for trans girls on his phone over me. I have always battled badly with depression, I can literally sleep non stop for weeks if you let me. 

But, now, I feel like I have hit my wall. I have no motivation for anything, want to drop out of school..I would absolutely never do it, but I keep thinking about just hooking up with someone else, so I can feel good and feel adequate again. Especially since my husband is constantly asking if he can go drop a few hundred dollars to go meet up with a trans girl... Just been a shitty year and I'm mentally over it all."
2134,depression,Relapse,"It feels so defeating when you start to feel better and then fall back into your old habits, emotions, and self destruction. It’s kind of like a trick. My biggest fear is being as sick as I was 6 months ago or when I was 17 etc. Each time my depression reaches a new high point, I fear I’ve done nothing right to combat it. All of my efforts are washed away. I always thought I didn’t have to think my adult life through because I wouldn’t be alive. Even though I’m committed to being alive now, how many times have I told myself that before?"

2144,depression,"Depressed girlfriend wants to break up with me. Is it possible that after recovering, she could still feel love for me?",
2145,depression,How do I escape this darkness I'm in?,"My life is technically one of the easiest. I don't have a wife or kids, great family and friends, I love the company I work for, make good enough money, and am in a living situation where I pay very very little rent.

However, I'm writing this from one of the darkest moments in my life. While I love my company, I can't stand my boss. I am extremely over worked (working very long hours and weekends) and never have time to prioritize certain passions outside of work. I feel like I'm behind in the latest technology stacks and would like to learn them, but honestly, every time I'm done with work, the last thing I want to do is be on a computer. I feel stuck in my position because I feel no team or company wants what skills I can bring. I'm an extremely hard worker, always delivering on time with quality, and my coworkers say I'm talented, but my boss doesn't appreciate me.

On top of that, my love life is non-existent. The last girl I liked left me for someone who lives across the country and I can't get over it. I rarely get matches in online dating, but when I do, they say 1 thing (if I'm lucky) and never talk to me again. I've lost all confidence in my physical appearance and hate the many things that are ugly about me. Friends and family say I'm ""a catch"" but no one seems to notice.

But like I said, my life is easy. I am blessed that I technically have the freedom I have. But I also hate my life currently. I'm not suicidal, but I do wish I was dead. I'd like to seek help, but I don't think a therapist will work. I just feel stuck and alone in a life that keeps dragging on. I honestly don't know how people with kids and other stresses keep going. You are all amazing and I feel like an asshole for complaining when I think about you. But this is my life.

If anyone has any ideas to help please let me know."
2146,depression,Scared of getting better,I had a psychiatric appointment earlier. I had been putting it off for months but had a moment of motivation last week and booked a meeting. The moment was short lived but I thought I may aswell go anyway. They prescribed me with Sertraline and I'm gonna be on it next week. The reason I'm scared is because knowing I can kill myself at any moment brought a level of comfort in my life for the last 10 months. It helps me have the mindset of well I can always do it tomorrow. I know I can't be happy in my current circumstances and it's why I want to end it all. But I still have that small feeling of wanting to get better because I know how good life can be. I'm scared if I start taking these meds that I will be in a middle state of not being happy but not sad enough to die. I'm scared of being in the middle just suffering
2147,depression,Giving up on your passion,"I sit here with a bullshit degree in History despite my love for it. There was no reason for it. There's no way you can leverage what I have into something without it having an Ivy league status on it. I see my future plain as day now, 20 years in a cubical only to be cut short by a self-inflected gunshot wound. Don't waste your time kids, it's not worth it."
2148,depression,There isn’t a way to get help.,"I’ve been massively depressed for 3 years now, been on and off suicide watch for 2 years and I’m convinced there is no way to get help. Full disclosure I’ve got BPD as well and surprise surprise my ex left me due to a mix of BPD and depression. I live in UK where healthcare is free and yet I’ve been through all channels and I still just slip the wide fucking cracks.

It’s been 2 years since my ex left me and I’ve ruined my fucking life, even before it, FOR HER as well. I just don’t see any end to my torment. I don’t get how it gets better. I want to just be free of this pain. Tonight I took 4x the max dose of my strong fucking meds and I just feeling like tomorrow I’m going to take 30+ plus just for the slightest bit of fucking attention. I’ve even written a one sentence note for my ex just in case.

I’m starting to feel the meds I took now and I just want to say that everything is fucked. It’s all fucking fucked. Society doesn’t give a shit if you’ve got any issue, you’re just another cog in the machine. Fuck you,"
2149,depression,Goodbye,[deleted]
2150,depression,Plateauing (Bipolar Depression),"I'm a 20 year old guy. These are the years I should be having the time of my life right? At least thats what society pushed on me as a kid. Now, I'm just having a hard time understanding. As days pass I find myself consistently doing the same things over and over. I try to branch out and do activities I haven't done or done in a while, but I never seem to enjoy them. I understand that I'm not going to enjoy everything, but can't I at least enjoy something? Video games, music, movies, being with friends, dating, everything just seems so bland and uninteresting, or a waste of my time (like I'm not wasting my time laying in bed for 70% of my day). It hurts my heart that I haven't felt happy since, well I'm not even sure when. The closest I get to feeling excited about something is when I get addicted to it for the first week or two I start. Then I just lose interest. If I can't be happy I'd at least like to make something of myself, hopefully that will give me the motivation I need. Whenever I try to learn something new I get too ahead of myself in my mind and I end up expecting expert level results quickly. This results in me losing interest because I believe I can not achieve whatever goal or expectation I set for myself. At this point I've realized I am my own worst enemy. I don't know what happened to the person I used to be. I miss him. Weed is the only way I feel like me again. I used to be so full of energy and excitable. Sometimes I can get frenzied abnormal excitement bursts. Other times I feel like a magnet to my bed, sinking in my sheets just to escape from everything. When I don't have these emotional issues I am just neutral. Numb. Because of this, it discourages me and I am scared of social interactions. I'm scared to and get a job. Its getting to the point where I'm running out of my savings but I can't emotionally and physically get myself to go out there and just live life. It's gotten even worse since the pandemic. Staying in my bedroom all day because I feel safest. Even though it's probably killing me. I don't know what to do with myself anymore. Death to me is just an easy way out. As much as I want to be happy someday. I don't want to hurt anymore. I am so fucking sad. I've been putting this off for a while because I don't know who to talk to. I feel like everyone looks down on me, and if I share the deepest part of me. The part I never share with anyone, how I feel, I start to think they'll see me as some dopey loser. I hope someone can read this and understand that you're not alone. I also hope I can get help from another source thats not a doctor, I hate the way my anti-depressants make me feel. I'm starting two college classes soon, I hope I can manage."
2151,depression,I'm disappointed with the way I was raised,"My parents are not very smart and did not do a good enough job preparing me for adulthood. They made a lot of poor choices in their lifetimes and they've taken to blaming me for some of them.

They believe it is my responsibility to settle their concerns and they place their happiness on my shoulders.

I was not raised as I should have been.My childhood was spent indoors as I was not allowed outside and I was discouraged from having friends. As a result I was socially stunted. I grew up in a poor neighborhood with low class people. I had no opportunity to socialize with anyone.

I felt disempowered and isolated. I did poorly in high school because I felt left out of social life and I lacked crucial skills in interpersonal relationships and self regulation in public. I'm very ashamed of the things I did between the ages of 12 and 18, some of which were crimes and morally reprehensible.

I performed below expectations in high school and went to University completely unprepared for higher education and for life. I did not even understand what a bachelor's degree was, I was just following a path expected of me by my parents. I wasted 4 years in University and another 4 afterwards struggling with my mental state and struggling to find a job. I struggled to go back to school because of my poor grades, low confidence, and bad associations with formal education.

I feel that I was unprepared for life due to poor parenting, bullying, low quality education, bad choices and my own stupidity, immaturity and intrinsic, innate worthlessness.

I am 26 years old without a worthwhile education, gainful career path, healthy social circle, life experience or healthy state of mind. I am lacking in every conceivable area of my life and I have had little to no real successes of significance in the past 8 years of my existence. I am no better today than I was on my 18th birthday.

In comparison, others in my demographic have built financial nest eggs for themselves, forged strong relationships, carved out careers, traveled the world extensively and meticulously documented their travels, improved their skillsets and planned for their futures.

I, on the other hand, have humiliated myself publicly, failed in school, boast and empty resume, been housebound for nearly 3 decades, inching closer to being on the wrong side of 30 with nothing to show for it but an overweight and aging body and a laundry list of failures and bad decisions.

No one can say with any conceivable stretch of the imagination that I am not a failure of a man. I have failed to launch and failed to make any use of the opportunities I had. Anyone with half a brain and an ounce of common sense would have done better than me.

I feel that I have missed the boat to justify my existence and that I have failed too severely to find any real purpose or desire to live. Anything I do will be clouded with the poison of my past. I cannot enjoy living because I have never enjoyed living. I have had a bad life that didn't need to be so, had those around me, and I myself included, been better suited for the roles we found ourselves in and better prepared for adulthood and responsibility.

I should have been taught financial literacy, how to talk to people, shown my options instead of being herded in my caregivers' self interests. I should have been raised by people who understood what they were advising me about, people with critical thinking skills who could guide me with kindness and wisdom rather than fear and insecurity

I wish I were someone better, someone normal. I wish I'd had a more normal life and not this. My problems are stupid and I am stupid. What kind of low worth dumb loser wastes everything he had to end up like this. Nearly 30, living with his mother, no romantic or social experience at all, no job, poor grades, disconnected from anything and everything, not in control of his own life.

I have written a lot because I do not speak to anyone about this. I hardly open my mouth at all. I was a mistake and I shouldn't have been born"

Even before then, I couldn't get these thoughts of my family dying out of my head and it would keep me up at night. Between then and now I had one major breakdown where I just completely gave up on classes for a week. January so far, has been a terrible month for me. I just can't stop thinking about the future and I feel like such a failure to everyone. I got a job for myself because people expected me to and my girlfriend also wanted e to. I'm not sure if I can handle a job while also doing school full time. I'm also not sure if my career means anything anymore. I'm an English major because writing was the only thing I could actually do and enjoy but everyone I talk to basically sees it as a waste of money and maybe it is. I'm scared because sometimes I just think of ending it all because I don't want to see anyone else around me die, but I'm also tired of everyone being disappointed in me.

I'm still coming to terms with it. *sigh* just before I start let me note that this could be very triggering to some so if you are triggered by rape or anything In that spectrum then please dont continue reading this for your own health &lt;3

Okay. My name (or online alias) is Rue. So, all of the events that I'm about to tell you about happened from ages 4-10. I don't remember when each thing happened so I do apologize for that.

When I was younger I had this group of friends. They're all much older than me. Each of em' being 5 or 6 years older than me so as of now they're all 19 or 20. I'm going to be calling them BAS. I would use their names but I won't out of fear someone I know may see this and do something to them. And before i get into the story, yes, they're all girls.

So, BAS. They were really my only friends throughout my childhood, I was bullied a lot in elementary school and Im the youngest of 5 so my siblings never really hung out with me much. BAS were my friends. I like to think so anyways. At first they did abandon me quite a bit. They would make me stay at the top of the street while they all went off and hung out. I remember sitting at the top of the street on my bike with our home phone waiting for them to tell me when to come down. They never did until they came back up and went home.

Let it be know that I do still deeply care for and love each one of these girls. I know I probably shouldn't, but they were still there for me when no one else was, even if they were still horrible to me. They helped me survive my childhood while also making it worse for me in the future. I have mixed feelings about it all if you can't tell.

My home life wasn't the best (I don't feel like getting into it too much so just trust me or look at some of my other posts if you'd like) and so I was more often than not hanging out with BAS. 

So. Here goes everything. The part I've been locking up in my mind for so very long. It's been slowly draining me and eating away at the little will to live I have left.

They rape me.

It all starts with a blanket fort and some good old fashioned truth or dare. 

Harmless? Right..

Well, no. I'm gonna tell you what I remember, and I'm not sure that I remember it all but I'm honestly sorry if you have read this far and are going to continue on because it gets bad for little 4-10 year old Rue from here on out.

The first thing about truth or dare I remember was the rules. After 2 truths you HAD to pick a dare or else you had to do the punishment (it was probably something stupid like lick a toilet seat or something I dunno) and so I always followed their rules. Keep in mind I also wanted to impress them cause they were older and cool and I wanted to be accepted as their friend. I remember this dare. ""I dare you to eat me out."" Now at the time I had no clue what that was so they showed me by eating me out and then had me do the same. I ate the one who dared me out, A. I dont remember a lot from it..thinking about it makes me kinda sick cause I viewed them as my sisters. And this one happened in our little blanket fort. Parts of me will probably never trust blanket forts again heh..

The next thing I remember was the group masturbation. It was probably also cause of a dare but I dont remember. I remember them taking me to the bathroom with them (none of this takes place at my house or when any adult is anywhere around) and them taking their pants and underwear off, telling me to do the same. I did as I was told. I remember not knowing what was happening and then them shoving a uh, a plunger inside me (hurt a lot) and kind of, uhm, ig, raping me with it...then they told me to keep doing it to myself and I did as I was told even though it hurt. They were masturbating and moaning. They never turned the lights on. I can't imagine seeing their faces after they did something like that to me..

The third thing I remember. I dont remember very much from this. But A had a dog and BAS kept daring me to suck his dick. I don't recall ever doing it but I remember how much pressure they put on me to do it..

And the final thing I remember....
Probably one of the hardest things to remember..

BAS tried to get me to suck my brothers dick. 
My brother was also friends with BAS (he had/has no idea what BAS did to me) and they were playing truth or dare. My brother didn't know I was there. They blindfolded him and put earmuffs on his head so he had no idea what was happening. He unzipped his pants and they pulled out his dick..horrifying...then they started forcing my head down, trying to make me give my own brother a blow job....I broke free and ran away, I ran to the park and just cried for a while. My brother still has no idea that this happened to me and I have no idea what happened after I left...

BAS did a lot to me...but they were intertwined with my entire family. Everyone in my family knew/knows them and all still love them dearly. I'm unsure of how to proceed with all of this constantly bouncing around in my head..it's hard to handle. Some people say I should press charges but I know it'd be too late. I love BAS anyways and dont know if I could ever face them while bringing this up.

If anyone has any advice on how to live with myself and get over this all then that would be very much appreciated. I apologize for this post being so long but thank you for reading all the way to the end &lt;3 
Here's a poem I wrote for your troubles

Gone:

Gone with the wind

But a humble speck of dust

Viewing the world through my various endeavors 

The wind carries me 

I go where it pleases

The winds cradle me as I whisper in your ears

I'm invisible

I'm gone with the wind before you can see me pass by

A humble speck of dust

Watching this world

Watching the chaos

Watching you

Watching me

Watching us

Just a humble speck of dust

Gone with the wind"
2156,depression,i want to love life but i don’t know how to,"i’m only 17. i have a whole life ahead of myself yet my life has gone to shit in so many ways. my parents aren’t together but both of them are emotionally unstable and a lot of my childhood was dealing with the trauma that my mother gave me because of her untreated bipolar disorder. this past summer my best friend’s boyfriend killed himself and she stopped talking to me because she told me that i was somehow responsible for his death. i can’t help but constantly think about all of the pain i put onto her already difficult life because i tried to introduce her to a boy i hardly knew the winter before. i hate myself so much; everything i do seems to be a constant reminder of the pain. when i have trouble zipping up my pants that are 4 sizes bigger than they were a year ago, i feel so disgusting because i know i’m thirty pounds heavier from the binge eating. i met with a nutritionist to kick the habit but i’ve just gotten heavier. when i have pictures taken of me by my boyfriend or friends, i immediately want them to be deleted because i can see how fat i am and how disgusting i look now compared to less than a year ago. i don’t even look like myself anymore and i can barely take care of myself and my body. i constantly feel like i don’t deserve it and i should just die for the sake of everyone around me and their wellbeing. i hate that i can’t fit into any of my clothes that i used to fit in consistently for the past four years. i can’t lose the weight and it’s making me so miserable. i feel so ugly. i’ve thought about breaking up with my boyfriend of over a year so many times because i just can’t make him happy and i’m constantly crying, complaining, angry, or having a panic attack. when my boyfriend and our mutual best friend tell me how beautiful they think i am, i can’t help but want to cry because i don’t believe them at all and i can’t fathom that someone could think that about me, after all of this trauma and grief and depression and insanity that has plagued me and only built up for the last seventeen years of my life. i want to let go but their eyes that always smile at me tell me i can’t, because i know that there are happy times with them. i like feeling the rays of happiness try to permeate the cloud of darkness over my head, even if only for a split second, through my laughter or my smile that i can feel stretch across my face. deep down i know life is worth living but i can’t help but contemplate suicide and stay up late calculating the lethal amounts of drugs for my height and weight. i feel the constant urge to self harm because it’s been a habit that i can’t get rid of even after all these years. i have nasty marks all over my left thigh and my forearm and i feel the cringing looks from others when my sleeve accidentally comes up too high on my arm. i just don’t know how much longer i can keep pretending like i’m okay. i’m burning out so quickly; i feel like a lit candle with the lid on, where the flame is so vibrant for a time until suddenly it just extinguishes at once from the oxygen shortage. i feel like i can’t breathe"
2157,depression,What's wrong with me,"Like I've wanted to find out what's wrong with me most of my life. I feel so horrible and recently I have been wishing I were dead(but then when I think about death too much my anxiety kicks in). I'm married and have a dog. But it's so hard to take the dog outside, but I do it anyway. I try my best to be around my husband but I feel like I'm not really there. Me being able to do those things makes me think that I'm just taking or being lazy. At least that's something I know my family will say if I tell them how I'm feeling. Oh and sometimes my mood changes so drastically. I'll be really happy for a day or two and then my depression slams me back down. 
When I'm depressed it gets really bad for me. Like I can't even look at myself in the mirror or look people in the eye. I just feel ugly and hate myself."
2158,depression,Looking for help,"Hi, so I just installed reddit on my phone and I have no idea what I’m doing right now and I’m feeling stupid by even writing this. I created my account about a year ago, som I’m not entirely new to this thing, but I still need to get used to this. It’s been a month or so that I started reading reddit posts about how fucked up people’s lives are and how some people just wanna fucking die. I’m at the lowest point of my life right now: emotional and economical. For example I really love gaming, but I’m too poor to buy a good setting and play good games. On the emotional side, I have no one to talk to and all families and friends around me just make the situation worse. Even my parents crush my soul. I don’t know. I just wanted to embrace this thing. I appreciate every comment.
Ps: I really don’t know how reddit works so sorry."

2160,depression,I'm glad these communities exist,"It doesn't feel right to post this on r/suicidewatch, though that is the sub this post is about. Unsure what to title this as well. 

Couple years (and accounts) ago I made a post there about my imminent death, planning on jumping after finishing my drink. It just seemed like my existence was burdensome, to the point I'd force myself back asleep because it made me feel like I simply wasn't.

I posted on suicidewatch for the only time that night, and received many ""hey life is worth living, want to talk"" messages, which came from a nice place, but the very last thing I wanted to do was explain myself, it felt incredibly narcissistic, manipulative, and self indulgent to talk about myself since I felt all I did was think about how I felt, and it sickened me. I also didn't want to feel that other person's pressure for me to live.

So I wasn't sure what I was looking for in making that post, and don't want to reveal too much so others can't find my old accounts (im sure I've said things I'm ashamed of) but after an hour there was a comment or two (may have combined them in my mind) which helped me. 

It went something like, ""what you said about how every moment of happiness feels selfish cleared some shit up for me, thanks. Everyone has a time to clock out, if yours is now then enjoy the fall.""


Something in my whiskey soaked brain seemed to click, and I let myself pass out that night. I wasn't delighted to be alive the next morning, things didn't radically change, but the idea that someone heard what I was dealing with and replied so nonchalantly made me smile, the fact that it helped them understand themselves a bit better was just gravy.

A bit later on I stood on the edge of a high rise's roof and stared straight down, forced myself to make the decision right then, forever. If I hadn't had that previous experience, I'm not sure that would have gone the way it did.


Today, I wouldn't call myself exactly ""cured"", but life is pretty fucking great compared. Even the in-between moments that would ruin the day have become easier to deal with. I'm basically only doing things that I enjoy or that bring me closer to my goals, whereas before I'd punish myself with tasks and not pay attention to my body. Only downside is that I waste time on dating apps since my sex drive is back and way up, but I'm a bit lazy with it and am waiting for a girl to trip into my lap.

This post is rather lengthy, sorry, but I suppose it's right to thank those who take the time to connect with the stranger having an awful day, and especially to those who understand that while suicide isn't a solution, it is an option, and that simply denying that reality to suicidal people only makes em feel more alienated."
2161,depression,I've never felt more lonely than when my friends and family say they care,"My parents were on the cusp of a divorce by the time I was born. They fought like hell for years over me and my siblings. Put us in the middle of their conflict. Both convinced they were right, that they loved us more than the other parent, etc. They did and I believe do both love us in their way as best they can, but they're products of their own bullshit.

My mom used to hold me when I was angry or sad or screaming, often to see my dad or to stop fighting or whatever, and she would just tell me I couldn't see him or that he needed to change or whatever. It was a regular occurrence for me to erupt emotionally and for her to comfort me in this way. On some physical level it was absolutely comforting, I would exhaust myself in her arms and warmth and finally fall asleep. This is clearest example I've found, but similar patterns repeated with both parents for years. The psychological torture in tandem with the physical comfort really fucked me up. Like, 30 years later and I feel like I'm just starting to see how fucked up it is.

I knew there were problems, I've been to therapy, I've managed to build relationships of all types, some seemingly quite strong. I make them love me, like lay down in the road obsessive love. It's not a healthy love, and once I feel like it's there I spin them through my mental labyrinths, repeating the trauma I went through, knowing they can't pull away from that love addiction. There is always a distance, or a conflict, or a tension with them. I equate any hint of their love/care/compassion with that mental anguish. I run from it or reject it or don't believe it or find it hollow or temper my experience of it waiting for the floor to drop, denying their gift to me. And it always does at some point. Every significant relationship I've built mirrors that opposition in some way. I'm uninterested without the drama, the pain, and conflict, the empty words and touches coupled with sadistic actions and behaviors. I'm always on the cusp of misery, with spurts of emotional highs just enough to keep me clinging to some hope of some feeling of security that will come just on the other side of...

The more I understand about the pattern, the more I try to rise above it. To call it out with partners or friends. To break the fourth wall, use safe words, attempt to navigate the chaos in tandem. But it doesn't seem to lessen. It's made things stable enough to carry on day to day for the most part, but the intensity of the fucking roller coaster, of the peaks and troughs, is getting brutal the older I get and the higher the stakes. It's like an addiction, needing a higher dose of both love and pain each time I oscillate to pull back towards a center.

My family won't give up on me but they don't want to actually understand what's in my head (I've tried so many fucking times) because it causes them discomfort. They tell me to stop torturing myself, to stop dwelling on the past, to think positive. As if this is all just some game I'm playing because I'm bored or something. I don't know how to break the pattern because every time I make a deliberate attempt to it just somehow ends up playing right in to the cycle. I'm intractably lonely whether with someone or not and I don't know which is worse anymore.

Every time someone tells me they care (particularly fam) I either go ape shit and terrify them with the reality of my mind or pull as far away as possible without breaking the string between us for days, weeks, months until the cycle repeats. I'm fucking tired of the cycle. I just want peace."
2162,depression,"I don't know where to talk, I just want to write","(Sorry for my English, i try to do my best)

I don't know where to talk about this, but I just want to write, I feel so tired of everything, of the people, of the media, of my city, of thinking, of feelings, I think that the reasons of many people here are more serious than mine, and I honestly think that the reason why I write is stupid, but feeling like that just for a woman who left me 2 years ago, yeah it’s a stupid reason, or I don't know Maybe it’s not, i don't know. I don't want to do anything, study, work, meet people, look for opportunities, I just want to disappear to some place where she doesn’t look for me anymore, where she does not make me feel crazy, a place where she does not appear in dreams, a place where the songs don’t speak to me about her, just  I want some peace some tranquility, I don't want to think any more or doubt about that woman who tells me that she feels the same as me, that tells me that I am the love of her life ... I know that she is lying to me, although I want to believe that she is not. But well, I know I'm not good enough for her, that's what she makes me understand.

This feeling really tires, so much time, and so much loneliness, it doesn't bother me to be alone, I just would like to feel good somewhere, maybe find someone who makes me feel good, that although can't promise me that everything will be fine, but just tell me that I’m gonna be fine, I just wanna hear something, whatever."
2163,depression,Just Angry and Numb,"The past few days my depression hit me like a truck. I've been doing really well for just about a year now but the bad thoughts are coming back and it's driving me nuts. I keep procrastinating on homework and it's making me disappointed in myself, I can't seem to clean my room, I keep forgetting to take my meds, and there's a mouse in my room AGAIN. This mouse thing is particularly bothering me because I just hate hate hate knowing there's a creature that comes into my room at night chewing and defacating on my floor until I startle awake and cause it to run back into my wall. I'm so so tired and so not motivated to do anything. I just keep thinking of class and not doing the homework and how exhausted I am. I'm thinking about not going to class tomorrow.

2166,depression,how can i be okay?,"my depressive/impulsive episode destroyed my reputation, character and a valued relationship. These things that I spent 4, almost 5, years working on and bring up. I spent 4/5 years putting so much effort to be a respectable person, but all my hard work was destroyed within two months. And now I’m stuck facing the consequences of my actions and my destroyed character. I’m so ashamed, so no I’m not okay. I’m alone and scared. I can’t escape this. Everything I dedicated time and effort toward destroyed so quickly. 

Now I watch life pass by without me. No I’m not okay. I don’t know when I’ll be okay. But it won’t be for a while. And I’m fucking scared. I want to go back prior to that stupid impulsive phase. But I can’t. I’m stuck."

2168,depression,"Minimalism, hoarding and depression","Hi everybody, I'm 27 years old, and I've been a sort of a hoarder for my first 20 years of my life. After lots of hard times, I decided to declutter my room, and my possessions in general. I purged tons of useless stuff, and then discovered minimalism. I kept reducing my possessions because it felt good, and the right thing to do. Owning less was great, and it brought me joy. But now, I'm suffering again from depression, I spend all my time in bed, sleeping or thinking, and this is happening: I miss all the things that I removed from my life, from sentimental items to... Well, anything. I'm really regretting getting rid of all that stuff, because I'm facing a period of deep nostalgia, and I just want to drown myself in memories, physical and non, but I'm left without most of the little gadgets, toys, old books, and so on, and I feel very bad about it. I really don't know how to cope with these feelings, these thoughts, because they're becoming kinda an obsession. I think I'm just gonna collecting stuff again, hoarding but more wisely, to suppress my emotions and trying to repair what I've done in these 7 years. Because I'm not designed to be happy, since my teen years I suffered from mental illnesses, and even if I'm seeing a couple of therapists (a psychologist and a psychiatrist, for my meds), things will never change. I'm going to live in my room (I'm an ex-hikikomori), accumulating treasures and burying my mind in deep sleep and stuff. Sorry for this rant, I already posted it on r/minimalism, but I thought that maybe here you can help me with some advice, somebody who faced the same problems as me could have a solution. Thank you!"

This year, I got into my dream school and program. But I couldn't do it online, so I withdrew. I hope to go back when possible but more and more that seems unlikely that'll happen anytime soon. Now it feels like I'm going nowhere. I'm 21 and all my peers are close to graduation and seem to have everything figured out. People keep telling me it'll work out but I don't believe them anymore.

I don't get any satisfaction from my hobbies anymore and feel tired all the time as well. Then I feel guilty about not doing anything and it just compounds the problem. Luckily, my family is supportive. But deep down I truly believe they're disappointed in me. I feel empty. Negative thoughts go through my head all day and I don't know how to stop them. I can't seem to distract myself from them. I feel as though if I try to reframe my thoughts positively, then I'm not holding myself accountable for what I percieve to be my failure as a person. There was a time when I believed in myself and had confidence. Now that feels long gone. And I don't know how to get back to that point."

I really  do hate myself and it hurts so bad, it feels painful to be alive and myself, it feels pointless do to anything because I will always be myself. I want to end and not a soul cares. I've been suffering for so long and I cant go on forever like this without anything or anyone. I need something to hold onto. something about myself to love. someone who cares about me. a life worth living. I've been trying to give this to myself and I don't understand how its this much of a battle, It feels like I cant get that and its my fault. Its definitely me.

2174,depression,Roommates leave me out of everything,"Don’t really know why I am posting this, but I needed somewhere to vent. I have been “best friends” with one of my roommates for about 5-6 years. We met in high school and decided to be roommates our freshman year, but our sophomore year we moved off campus and had another roommate move in with us. We have a 3 bedroom townhouse and their bedrooms are upstairs next to each other and mine is located in the basement. I have always felt so excluded, even from the first year we all started living together, but this year is fucking horrible. In particular today they were talking about scheduling conflicts and 3 hour time difference blah blah and I decided to ask them if they were going to the west coast and my one roommate responds and says “Yeah hahaha, we are going to Colorado, but like obviously with other people not just us two.” So, that was a great way to find out that I am going to be alone one week of the semester. They didn’t even have the decency to tell me prior. I have been dealing with the exclusion for so long and I don’t know what to do at this point. I am so depressed and trying to deal with this does not help at all. I really do try to do things with them, but it’s always me who has to ask where they are going or what they are doing and even when I ask they never invite me. I also have like no other friends here and thanks to covid I can’t really make any either."

2186,depression,Fastest way to die?,"Let's say that I, hypothetically, want to die. What would be the fastest, most efficient method of ending my life?"
2187,depression,Im the most depressed ive ever been?," Ill just make this short because its too long to read but basically I fell in love with this girl that didn't feel the same way about me. I've been stuck on her for over a year now. We stayed friends for a while but she cut it off like 2 months ago because she felt she was leading me on. She knew how much I liked her. I never said I loved her though but I know I do and I recently just saw that she's dating someone now. Its literally making me think suicidal thoughts. I know I won't actually do it but its just thoughts.  


Im so damn depressed I haven't eaten all day. I know I won't sleep tonight. I dont have any motivation for anything anymore. Im so mad I just feel like breaking everything I can't get my hands on but I know that won't do any good. I want to piss her off so bad somehow but I dont want to be that type of guy. I feel like I hate her so much but still love her more than anything. she's so important to me I feel like I can't move on. I can't stand the fact that she will probably be having sex with this prick and being all cuddly with him. Thats the part that fucks me up the most. I really dont even know what im asking. I guess how to move on quickly? by the way we work at the same place unfortunately. I haven't seen her in two weeks and I really am thinking about just ignoring her even though she won't care. All we do is say hi to each other anymore."
2188,depression,I feel like an incompetent idiot and brain dead,"Ever since I hit rock bottom with depression I just honestly feel so dumb and I feel like I can't even think straight or put anything together in my head. I can think normally and figure out whatever it is that I am thinking about, but I forget things more often and I feel horrible.

I get headaches everyday, I don't even know if I am healthy. I weight 125 lbs for a guy who is 5'7 and I honestly fucking feel like this pandemic has helped me depression wise, but it's almost a year trapped in the house and I am losing my sanity! I am lonely as shit and got nothing to do.

Life has to be the worse! I used to dread college, but ever since graduating I have nothing to do. I've been holding off from applying for a full time job because I feel so unqualified with a 3.0 gpa, but in reality I know I shouldn't be doing that. I need to be on the job hunt like right now ASAP! 

Anyone feel like this? I know I can't be the only one. Lastly, the worse part from all of this is that I am stressed out because of it. I don't sleep well and everyday is the same cycle and routine. I've been doing so much better, but everyday I have hours where I am so depressed and then I go back to being normal. I feel so weird and just not like my usual self at all. :("

2190,depression,Am I unloveable,Some days I look at myself a little too long and I wonder why I am the way I am. I don’t consider myself beautiful yet I’m told I am. I don’t consider myself a good person yet I’m told I am. If people think I’m a good person and they find me attractive then why can’t someone love me? Is it because when they start to get close to me they can finally dissect all my flaws like I do? Or is it because they finally see me for what I really am? In all honesty I don’t know what I am. This is kinda all over the place and this post really has no point I guess I’m just ranting. I just wish someone would stick around king enough to love me and my flaws.
2191,depression,I want to sleep all day.,I don’t want to go anywhere or do anything. Just trying to distract myself into forgetting that I’m depressed.

2194,depression,I don't want to be around my family anymore,"For my whole life -- and especially since this coronavirus stupidity came into play, my family has been constantly giving me reasons to not want to talk to or be around them. Every single day, I am reminded of why I can't take any of this shit anymore with them. From my mother, step-father and their friends and family, and my brother-in-law and the fucked up shit he says and believes in and constantly berating and belittling me for not agreeing with him on every single thing imaginable, to my father's fucked up family and all of the inexcusable things he has done time after time (and me always having to hear about it, even though I have made it perfectly clear that I don't want to), and just about everyone else in my lousy excuse for a family, biological and non-biological. Day after day, nothing changes. They all say and do the same shit time and again, and I am positive none of them are ever going to change.

Let's start with my parents. Ever since March or April (or whenever this godforsaken pandemic crap all started), they have bought into every single ridiculous conspiracy theory you could imagine. Literally all they ever really do now -- especially when my brother-in-law is at the house -- is yap constantly about politics and these absurd conspiracy theories with no proof to them (to be fair, there are a handful of conspiracy theories I believe are true, but the ones they believe are pretty much the most outlandish stuff you could imagine). They think this whole pandemic is fake and that vaccines are evil, satanic, and against the Orthodox Church (another thing that's been bothering me for years now, which I'll get into soon). They genuinely believe that 5G is going to give everyone the virus and that this is all leftist agenda meant to attack Trump. And speaking of Trump, ever since he lost the election to Biden (another senile con artist I dislike), they and all -- and I mean all -- of their friends won't shut the fuck up about how the election was fraudulent and that ""Trump won in a landslide"", blah blah blah. They think everything Trump says is perfect and ""he never lies"", ""the Demo-rats/Demon-rats/gay agenda/leftist communists"" are all out to get him, etc. I don't like Biden either, but this is just ridiculous at this point.

And when they're not taking about coronavirus or Trump, all of them love to go on and on -- oftentimes right in front of me, too -- about how there's a gay agenda and that gay people want to destroy traditional values, that they're all sinners and that ""the gay lifestyle"" is an abomination of epic proportions, and so on and so forth. They all know I support gay marriage, which is probably the main reason as to why they keep saying all this stuff constantly when I'm in the room with them or even if I'm just minding my own business reading a book, learning languages, playing a game, or listening to music in my room. Even if I put in headphones, I can't drown it out. And before anyone says ""well, why don't you talk about with them?"", I have tried numerous times, and it never, ever works. And it's not like I'm in the closet or anything -- I'm not gay. I just don't see anything wrong with two men or two women getting married and having a relationship. Personally, if they want to get married and they're not violating or interfering with your life, then who the hell cares? Why do you care so much that you have to talk about all the time? ""I don't hate the people, I just hate the lifestyle."", ""Don't hate the sinner, hate sin."" Fuck off with that hypocritical horseshit. I hate when ultra-devout Christians like my mom pull this kind of shit, because it just gives them an excuse to hate them anyway. My brother-in-law loves calling gay people he doesn't like ""fucking faggots"" and ""pillow-biters"" and everything else you could think of, so he's just as bad, if not worse. They have all made me ashamed to be supportive of it, and it makes me regret ever saying that I support gay marriage to any of them, knowing that this is how they all act about it. Whenever my mom's friends come over, they're no different either.

I honestly detest that my mom (or really my family as a whole) is an extremely devout Orthodox Christians. It's fucking bullshit that I have to put up with all the aforementioned stuff over and over again, day after day. When she's not blabbering about gay agenda this, evil lifestyle that, my mom loves to play these Orthodox Christian lectures all day long all the while telling me about how I'm not devout enough because I obviously disagree with her about some stuff that the majority of Orthodox Christians love to espouse regularly. Whenever I take off my cross for a day or turn on a meditation video or what have you, she loves to go on and on about how I'm such an apostate and ""not a real Orthodox Christian"". In the past, she has slapped me for saying things about religion that she disagrees with me on, and loves talking about how perfect Orthodoxy is and that she is right about everything and that ""if only I believed"" like she does, then I would be saved and whatnot. Keep in mind, I don't drink or smoke, haven't done any hard drugs in my life, stopped smoking weed over three years ago, have never been in any trouble with the law, have a good job, and have been following a pretty good path in my life since early 2018. However, because I don't follow fasting restrictions of the church and eat whatever I want (because I'm an adult in my twenties, not a kid anymore), she sees me as though I'm such a traitor and loves to belittle me about all these ""problems"" in my life all the while telling me about how her lifestyle is so great. There is no winning with her (or others like her, for that matter). I despise Christians -- regardless of what sect or background they are or come from -- who do this and act this way. People like that are a disgrace to Christianity and it speaks volumes about what kind of a person you are.

Then I have my father and his mentally-ill family with all of their issues. Every single time he does anything, I'm forced to hear about it without question, either from my mom or one of my sisters, relatives, or whoever else. I hate hearing about it, and I have made it perfectly clear to everyone I know who knows him and his psychotic family that I don't want him in my life because he's not a part of it anymore and hasn't been since I went into middle school.

All in all, I hate being part of this screwed up family and having to live with them for however much longer because I am unable to afford to get a house for myself at this time (partly because of this pandemic and all these ridiculous lockdowns). I wish they would all change for the better, but I know that's never going to happen so long as they don't change for themselves. I try to find any and every possible way to get my mind off of all of this shit (reading, watching movies, playing games, learning languages, exercising, etc) and it never goes away. Sure, my life could be a whole lot worse, and there are things I am grateful for (a job, a roof over my head, friends, and so on), but at this point, I just can't take it anymore."
2195,depression,I'm gonna end up,"I'm gonna end up dead one day the only thing keeping me from not killing myself is friends,family,pets 
I'm only 14 and I want to kill myself I hate life"
2196,depression,I need to vent,"I’m f 18 and I just don’t want to live for the future. I had been depressed last year and it was probably the worst My mental health has ever been. I was so close to just ending everything bc I hated the feeling but then around November I just ignored every feeling I had. I didn’t want to deal with depression and all the intrusive thoughts i had. I know I’m not okay But I don’t have anyone anymore I’m comfortable talking to and my anxiety is getting really bad again. I know I’m getting worse again bc I’ve stopped doing everything I’ve stopped caring and I want to self harm again even tho it has been 3 months since I’ve done it. I feel like if I do self harm I’ll be even more angry at myself but I don’t know how to cope. I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to and no matter how much I distract myself and meditate I can’t calm myself down. I end up freaking out and I don’t have anyone to talk to at all and I don’t want to talk to anyone bc I don’t want to burden them i don’t want them to have to hear my bullshit and I hate being those friends that use ppl as their therapist. As for therapy, I can’t get any bc of my mom she’s manipulative and she really doesn’t care abt my well-being. I’ve tried to write my thoughts down but if feels like the burden of them is still on me, it no longer feels like I’m getting it off my chest. I don’t know what else to do with myself bc when I would tell ppl how I was doing I just felt even worse for putting it on someone else and also I felt exposed to them. I don’t want anybody to know about me but I know things are getting bad again"
2197,depression,I feel alone,I’ve had consistent heartbreaks happen to me. I asked my ex to get back together he just lead me on and tells me it’s not what he wants after using me for a couple of days. My heart is broken. I can’t stop crying. I’ve been in my apartment for 3 days and just get up to sit on my couch and cry all day. I barely eat I’ve been sick to my stomach. My chest hurts it feels like I’m getting my heart ripped out. I wake up with anxiety. I just feel like I won’t be genuinely happy ever again. I feel so alone. I don’t know what to do.
2198,depression,Just do the first step. Then take it from there.,"I’ve been battling depression for about 10 years and have been steadily recovering for the past 3. This time of year still triggers my urge to stay in bed all day and binge eat til I throw up. I saw on a sub somewhere that someone recommended just taking the first step toward something productive and letting that momentum carry you.

So tonight I decided that was enough wallowing and that I was gonna try painting for the first time in months, which used to be my main coping tool. It seemed like such a huge task, getting the materials, thinking of a subject, cleaning the brushes, waiting for layers to dry...so all I did was resolve to stand up and turn on the lights. Then while I was up I decided I could just open the drawer where I keep my paint. Then one thing led to another and I painted not one but two small paintings!!

The one step of just getting up had no strings attached. I promised myself I could stop as soon as I decided I didn’t wanna do it anymore. But I just kept thinking “well I’ve already done X, might as well do Y” and before I knew it I was cheerfully working something that had completely distracted me from my intrusive depressive thoughts. And as I promised myself, towards the end when I started slipping again I reached a stopping point and put everything away. I’m back in bed now, but at least I did *something* productive. Baby steps, right?

I just wanted to share this technique that worked for me. Everyone is different but I hope this works for you too :)"
2199,depression,Can I speak to someone who has been through leaving high school or applying for college ?,"2021 already sucks. I feel really lost right now because I don’t think I have a future. I don’t know if I want go to college or not. There are so many things I’m concerned about that I can’t even type on this post. I’ve never worked at an official job, I’m really tired of schoolwork, I don’t know what to do when I leave high school, my parents won’t listen to me, I don’t want student debt, I don’t really want to go to college, etc.
The only thing I can really plan out correctly is my suicide."
2200,depression,Why does nothing work?,"I am 21. I’ve been suffering from depression, anxiety and a panic disorder for nearly 12 years now. Recently things are looking up for me, I’m going to uni in February, I’m moving city and I’ve got a great flat lined up. I’m going to therapy and am on medication. But I just can’t seem to stay happy. I have small periods of a few days where I am so happy and excited to move and study and then after that comes week long periods of calling in from work because I can’t even get out of bed. Things were okay for maybe a year of getting the right help, but after that they just tanked for seemingly no reason. I’m just so tired of it and I just want to stop everything. I don’t know where this is really going but I think I just needed to rant a bit. I feel very isolated at the moment. Hope y’all are having a good new year."
2201,depression,My parents aren't trying to but they are very toxic in my opinion What are my realistic options?,"My dad is a relatively wealthy person (in comparison to mom). He refused to contribute to my college   
bc I got a scholarship (despite giving a large chunk of money to my older siblings who also got scholarships) so my mom cuts a small part of her check every month to help me feel independent while attending uni. My Dad is very patriarchal and belittles my mother/her culture (she is apologetically submissive to his words) and his frustrations often spills over to me. 

He accuses me of stealing/lying with little to no evidence and often backs his arguments up with ""I make the most money in this house"". He emphasizes that bc I don't pay rent, I am not a real adult, and will not be taken seriously. He often jokes about this manner with friends and family over the phone. I have given him a written statement stating I am willing to pay $X for rent (from mom's allowance to me) but received no response. I currently do not contribute financially (besides groceries).

Unrelated but my father also makes racist remarks and I feel I have come accustomed to such and no longer fight those battles with him. This is very bothersome to me, but I have no control over his words. He also has bursts of anger (about 10 mins) which is related to his health condition. 

My younger siblings are uninvolved and have little responsibility in the home. I am the oldest still living at home.

I often dread going home and spend much of my day hours in public areas. For that reason I hope to move out to release the mental burden. I get the vib that I am not wanted at the home bc when hearing the parents speak of people in my similar situation, the never have good things to say. Both parents would disapprove the move, and would not support me (I have no vehicle or job) 

I am feed, clothed, and warm at night but am absolutely miserable. I often take melatonin upon reaching home so I am not hungry for dinner and go straight to bed. 

move out? Are my expectations of living at home too high? Is there anyway I can change this feeling of failure while living in this home? I place high priority on financial security."

2206,depression,The only reason I keep living is for my boyfriend,"I am so sensitive to everything that I am surprised I’m almost going to be 21. I thought I would have been dead by now. 

my depression gets so bad and family kind of hates me (aside from my mom) yet I’m dependent on them because they help me get my medicine and groceries as well as a place to sleep (All of these thanks to my wonderful mother) but I still have to deal with my stepdad and brothers 

I only stay alive because I have a boyfriend who has the same sort of weird interests as me   
these include trains, dinosaurs, 1920s-30s comedies 

and yes I am autistic 

often my little brothers give me sensory overloads because they think it is funny

They know I am an alcoholic, but they like me better when I am drunk. I am a good drunk. I am loving, caring, and honest when I am drunk. I am none of these things sober.

2211,depression,It feels wrong,"I don't know how to explain this, but I am going to try the best I can. In. July I tried to kill myself, a couple times actually. and after that everything has felt, like, wrong. My relationships, my house, everything feels slightly off. I feel like I was supposed to die then, and I feel out of place now. Like I'm in a parallel universe where things are supposed to be normal, but they're not. Things aren't okay and no one else can feel it. It's wrong in a way I can't describe. I am not currently suicidal- at least I don't think. But I still have this innate feeling that I shouldn't be here. And as time passes it gets worse. It feels so wrong."
2212,depression,Something different to investigate/try - psyilocybin mushrooms,"Reading people's posts each day on here show there is a lot of hurt. There are not many posts about ways to reduce depression though. I thought the following might help a person or two.

Over the past 6 months I have started growing mushrooms containing psyilocybin. Its not something I would normally try (I am a geologist/engineer) however it has greatly helped me.

I grind the mushrooms once dehydrated and add into capsules that contain 0.1g. One capsule 4x a week is enough to significantly help.

There is a lot of info on google and a few companies in Canada that are commencing trials with psyilocybin for depression, PTSD and anxiety. If businesses are starting to trial it to make a profit (and it works for me) it could be worth investigating if you are out of other options.

I am in Australia so its not the easiest to grow, but if you are in Canada or the US it is even legal in some states.

Just thought I would put up a different type of post in the hope it might help someone"
2213,depression,Clinical Depression and Sports,"Stop me if you probably heard this, but... I ended up crying tonight over a football game.

Again.

It can be silly to get upset or worked up over athletics, particularly if you're a fan and not actually being on the field of play, especially in the case of collegiate athletics, but I ended up dealing with another instance where Indiana University lost another bowl game and I wound up crying and becoming despondent over life cause they haven't won a bowl game since January of 1991.

Why do I root for Indiana University, despite not being a student or alumnus of said institution?  I don't know when it started, but I suppose it was due to the fact that I live in Indiana, or that I liked the team colors as a kid, or it was the basketball program.  But, one thing that is certain is... for decades, you didn't go to Indiana for the football.

For years, I was an awful Indiana fan.  I supported the basketball team, the soccer team, and the baseball team, but sneered at the football team.  Whenever they did poorly, I would call for the coach to be fired and justified how they always sucked.  Whenever they were average... I would call for the coach to be fired and that we deserved better.  I was even a horrible person once, yelling at one of the players on social media after we lost the Old Oaken Bucket.

Over a year ago, I finally realized why I was so antagonistic towards this program... I can never leave them, and I was always so mean to the program because I wanted the pain to hurt less.  Whenever good things seemed to happen, that's when they would hurt me the most.  We would always be close... so close, to defeating good teams, and instead have to sustain on enough moral victories to last many lifetimes.  I stopped being harsh and accepted life for what it was, deciding to support them as best as I could.

Life as an IU football fan is a perpetual thunderstorm.  We hold the all-time record for losses in the NCAA Division I level, the fewest Big Ten championships in football as far as original members go (Penn State has 4, with two outright, and even Chicago, who no longer are in Division I, have SEVEN) with a meager two, only one Rose Bowl trip, and the worst bowl winning percentage for any major program at 3-10 with today's loss.  We haven't won a bowl game since the Gulf War, when we beat Baylor at the Copper Bowl.  Indiana football is a very sad existence, and I thought we were making great progress this season, even with all the chaos, as we had our best ranking in program history.

Then the team gets smarmy about being snubbed from a major bowl game, and we lose to Ole Miss, and now a bunch of people are laughing at both the program and the fanbase for how we were feeling all season, and being someone who just wanted to finally feel like I was about to see something different with this program, I ended up feeling more of the same; heartache and disappointment.

So I cried.

Again.

I cried when we lost the Pinstripe Bowl and a kick wasn't contested.

I cried when we failed to compete against Utah at the Foster Farms Bowl.

I cried when we blew a lead and couldn't understand what an onside kick was in last year's Gator Bowl.

And I cried tonight.

My life is limited at the moment thanks to the pandemic and the medical issues my family is currently dealing with, so escapism is hard.  I don't like TV, and my hours at work are strict, so I don't know what I can do to replace sports.  It's not that I watch sports for gambling; I don't believe in betting money... I just watch because I wanted to see if years of suffering would finally come to an end, and instead that suffering is now hurting me emotionally and mentally more and more."

2216,depression,Should we ever have children?,"I'm 32, been on pills since I was 18. Admittedly, I ate shit at taking them consistently so MAYBE one of the like 8+ different chemical messes I've been would have released me from this burden but I'm fairly certain Im taking depression to my grave.

That being said.... Is it ethical for someone in our state to have children? I like to think that childbirth really changes a man and gives him a vastly different and more immersive view of the world. But even if I was blessed with that gift, with the crushing misery of work itself along with the bullshit interpersonal fuckfest of assholes that like nothing more than seeing you down, weekly thoughts of parents inevitably passing and the attempt to balance on the greased stringline known as a relationship (not even taking into account how fucked even getting your partner to not lose focus on the ""US"" in this On Demand, sell your grandma for a few fucking likes, 7th level of hell of a decade we've rolled through), I'm not entirely sure finally having that dream that I've yearned for since I was young would make me not a liability...

This could be in the form of letting them down on the fashion that I've let every fucking person I've been in contact with down, to leaving them with ""Mom told me that Dad really needed to go see God and he won't be able to come back right away"" to even passing on this genetic mess to them...

Is there any hope for me or people like me of they don't ever recover from depression? Thanks for listening, I'd love your thoughts."

2219,depression,I’m conflicted. Pls don’t give me hope as other people are in worse situations. If u want me to delete the post I will.,I am a child and young. I have a sibling who I don’t know if he is autistic or not but my parents only seem upset. I am 1 of four boys in my family and we are triplets with 1 older brother. My parents seem to only get more and more mad each day. I have only been a piece of shit to the people around me. I think back to when I was younger then I am now and think about how horrible I was. I am gay and my ego is so big that I need validation every 5 seconds. And if the attention is not on me I deal left out and sad. I know what I am saying sounds horrible and that is because it is. I am not depressed but worried. I am not good and I did not come here to loo for sympathy but a way to vent. I would like to tell you to either go to therapy or do something. I am to young to know what to do. I already am friends with someone who got accused of emotional manipulation lol. And that was on an animal crossing sub Reddit. I don’t know what to do..
2220,depression,Back injury is ruining my life and I’m not sure how much longer I can go on like this.,"Last year in June, I was sitting down and doing some work when I coughed and threw my back out. At the time, I was 38 years old and very healthy with no previous major injuries of any kind. Fast forward to now and I haven’t improved in the slightest. I can’t walk, bend, twist or lift any weight without severe pain. I can’t play with my dogs, I can’t make love to my fiancé, I can’t perform the job I was making a good living at. I’ve been through physical therapy, steroid shots, every type of diagnostic imaging you can imagine, and most recently I had surgery to fuse my SI joint in hopes that would fix things, but it hasn’t. I wake up everyday with the choice of taking pain pills for being in terrible pain, both of which have slowly caused me to spiral into severe depression. I take the maximum dose of Welbutrin that I can and it is becoming less effective every week. I hate my life. I can’t stand waking up anymore and I hate how I am ruining my fiancé’s life with me. Most of the time I wish she would just leave me now so at least then she could be happy. Nobody has answers. I’ve seen dozens of doctors and specialists and not a one has changed things to any degree. I want to give up. I have zero hope for the future and don’t want to live like this. I understand people with far worse disability than me live everyday, but frankly I don’t understand how. What joy can you get from life this way? I’ve become so frail and weak I don’t even recognize myself in the mirror anymore. I’ve tried talking to therapist and it doesn’t help at all. I’ll have brief periods where I feel positive and hopeful again but then more weeks tick by with no change and I spiral back down again and the spiral down is getting deeper and deeper. I would have killed myself awhile ago if it weren’t for the fact I would hurt my family. I just feel stuck. I’m forced to live a life I hate and there is no escape. Every where I go is a prison of my own suffering. I just want it all to end but it can’t."

2222,depression,The voice in the back of your head,"I guess everyone knows what I'm talking about. That thought that tells you you'll never be happy, successful or do anything of value. The thought that tells you to give up before you even start because what's the point in trying if you're just going to fail?

Has anyone ever felt the physical component to it? Like some days the thought crosses my mind and I've trained myself over the years to repress it but its like it comes out in another form? Like currently, I feel sick to my stomach. It's like the thought refuses to be ignored and wants attention. It will manifest itself in any way possible just to make sure I remember that I should be depressed and I should feel sad.

Still, I fight it. Some days are worse than others but I survive. I'm here.

Today is just one of the bad ones. Like a kill me now kind of feeling. Like I feel like seeing how sharp the knives in the kitchen are.

But still...I fight it and I will continue to do so. Today is just a harder day for some reason. I can't say why, it's just a feeling, unprovoked.

Just want to send that positive energy to those who are feeling the same way."
2223,depression,I am done with life,"I am done with life

19(m) virgin and I am done with living I am short, balding, hairy, and chubby/fat and I know people like to say just lose weight I can’t. Tried exercising didnt work , tried cutting back all my portions didnt work, I am trying calorie counting eating 700 cals less than I need to lose weight and ots not working. I haven’t even kissed a girl or been on a date NOTHING and my trajectory isn’t good. I know I am undesirable and physically apolling to look at which is why I do the world a favor and where a hoodie all the time all my friends either have had gfs or currently have one or have women that are intrested in them but me FUCK NO I don’t get anything not even a compliment about anything so fuck living and fuck me. Girls probably think I am just a big lump if play-doh I don’t even like looking at myself in a mirror I even get depressed when I masturbate because of how underwhelming I am physically and the girls I get off to wouldn’t give me a glance. I am so desperate for some compliments on my body I posted a pic of my self even though I know its asking for trouble I am hoping for the beat but I know it probably wont go well. My friends just tell me not to worry about it or think about it but its easy for them to say when they weight 120-180 and are smaller than me and built better than me I am just tired of having a fake smile and don’t want to do this anymore."
2224,depression,Frustrating discovery.,"FYI, this post does talk abt some sex stuff so click away if that makes you uncomfortable. I’m trying to be vague but that’s honestly all it’s about.



So I recently discovered that having difficulty ‘finishing’ is a side affect of depression. I’m a trans guy, not on testosterone, so you can probably guess enjoying myself is a little awkward at times. Over time I’ve trudged past dysphoria and am super sex positive, know how to try and focus on my pleasure, but can rarely ever finish. And by that I mean it’s been three times in the year I’ve been trying. Yeah. I don’t currently have a partner and haven’t been intimate with one in the past, so it’s just me myself and I haha. If I try out a toy or whatever I don’t want to feel like I have a ‘reliance’ on it. Is there anything wrong with needing some extra help in that department? (Since I’m not in a relationship rn I’ve not even going to TRY worrying about partnered sex)"
2225,depression,Thank you,"I just want to say thank you to all of the people who put themselves out here and speak their truth. We all have stones to carry, and some of them have serious weight. You are not alone, people will help you carry them, even total strangers on reddit. Life ebbs and flows, we just need to learn to ride the tide. Its easier together"
2226,depression,i don't understand what i am going through," 

I feel empty, I spend my days overthinking, and because of this I am stuck in a vicious cycle of stress and insomnia. I feel tired all the time and sometimes I find myself asking if living is really worth it. I constantly think about killing myself because anything is better than what I go through. Because of my state of mind dying must feel like going to sleep on a very cold night, the type of night where it's raining and you are wrapped comfortably in your duvet with little to no worries or stress. What i am writing might seem like a shock to people who think they know me but I am not a happy person. I may act happy or look happy but it's all just a front.

I  feel disconnected from society and everyone in general. The easiest way I can explain it is being trapped in your home while life passes you by. I sometimes feel like I am peering in from a window, not able to interact or connect with anyone.

I do not understand my feelings or anyone else's feelings. Most of the time I feel blank and the only emotions I have felt for a long time was intense sorrow. 

This sorrow I felt was like being wrapped by a giant monster. I try to turn around but the fear and sorrow is too much and it's like the presence of it causes me suffering and I haven't even faced it.

I think it is the years of me avoiding emotions causing them to build up, I recently started noticing that I go through great lengths to avoid anything that will make me feel any emotions."
2227,depression,I think I need help,"I was finally dumped by my ex more than a month ago after a lot of months of being on and off and it was good at first. I felt like we were better of without each other, and I would find someone better. But lately I’ve started to miss him a lot and I tried reaching out him yesterday after a month of No Contact. Surprisingly he replied and Then I realized it was a big mistake cause this made me realize i was still in love with him. He dumped me because he doesn’t want to settle down and having a family soon isnt anywhere in his plan. I told him I’ll wait for him no matter how long its gonna take. He still says no.
Idk what to do anymore, We’ve only been together for a little over a year but I really thought he was my soulmate. Im starting to get suicidal thoughts now, even though Ik that wont change the reality it still seems like the only way I could get some peace.
If anyone is/has been going through something similar, any advice is appreciated"
2228,depression,I'm so fucking tired of people romanticizing mental illness,"I hate seeing kids on twitter who think it's ""cool"" To have adhd or ""quirky"" To have depression. The newest mental illness I've seen being faked is DID. People think it's cool to have multiple personalities and basically these kids end up making OCs and say it's their other personalities. It's honestly infuriating because even besides social media people irl will feign mental illness in hopes of getting pity from others and it makes me so angry. I just hate it when people fake shit for pity in general. One time a girl at my school commited suicide and almost every girl in the school was saying ""omg she was my best friend"" No she fucking wasn't! The only reason they were saying that was so they could get ""victum by association"" Status because by being associated with her they are also victims of her suicide and was just trying to get pity from others and honestly it's sickening. I remember talking to my sister about it and she said I was ""judging how they cope"" And i told her that it seems very unlikely that the majority of the girls at my high school were ""best friends"" With this girl. My school has over 5000 students so it's honestly very unlikely that they were best friends with her but it's people like my sister who make it even worse they just feed into the pity bait and pity them and enable them to keep doing that shit. People will automatically just pity anyone because they want to look good they don't actually care about the person they are pitying they just don't want to be seen as the bad guy. But when people question the legitimacy of their claims you get called a ""gatekeeper"". I have actual mental illnesses and it's not fun at all in fact it's hell. Some people think hyper fixation is ""cool"" When i hyper fixate on shit it's genuinely terrible i end up not leaving my room or showering and just focusing on that one thing or I can't shut up about whatever I'm hyper fixating on and it annoys people around me it's not some fun quirky thing. I know mental illness affects everyone differently but to an extent it's kinda ridiculous for the type of shit some people will pull. Like for example over using trigger warnings is so fucking annoying I'm tired of seeing people making triggers over the dumbest shit. And the reason why they do it is to act like a victim I'm tired of people trying to victimize themselves or trying to act like they have trauma. Not everyone has trauma and it's just so shitty to act like you have trauma just for pity. People like this just piss me off. I hope I'm not the only person who realizes how terrible like this are."

Reading the first two posts will give better context, but I'll give a quick run down. I met a girl on reddit, we became a couple, we both have mental illness but hers is a lot worse along with her trauma, I'm doing the best I can think of to help her but I'm still worried. Anyways, so after I went on a drunken rant about how her problems are important and that she's not a bad person or a burden, I feel like I've inadvertently reinforced her beliefs. I have had very similar beliefs, but mine mainly stemmed from myself, whereas hers stems from her experiences and traumas. So while I am now doing much better now that I have her, she still is struggling. She's still alive which I'm very grateful for, I sobbed into my pillow for almost 20 mins when I got her first text. The problem is that at this point I feel like she's exclusively living because she thinks I'll be hurt if she killed herself. I was in the exact same situation as her before I met her, and from experience it's only a matter of time before she decides that dying is better for me than living. I got better by opening up to her, but in return I feel like she's closed off to me. She thinks that her problems don't matter and that they cause nothing but pain to me, and no matter how much i tell her otherwise I can't seem to change her mind. Before we got close, I feel like we were much more open because there werent any stakes, but now that we're together I think she doesn't want to tell me any of her problems out of fear of hurting me or driving me away. She has really bad abandonment issues, and had awful experiences with her past boyfriends, and I feel like these also play a major factor. Another part of it is that when i got drunk yesterday, I was doing dumb shit and giggling before she said that she only bothers me and wanted to go to sleep. I feel like even though I tried to explain how I feel to her, all she understood is that I was having a fun time before I talked to her and then I was sad. Even today, I wanted to watch a movie with her, but she couldnt until her mom went to sleep and said I should just go to sleep. I told her i want to watch the movie and spend time with her, and she kept refusing until i said I was going to stay up anyways and I might as well watch the movie with her if I will. I want to have her understand somehow that helping her with her problems and letting her vent and spending time with me isn't hurting me in the slightest, I'm the happiest i've been since early elementary school. Yeah it pains me to hear the horrible things she's been through, but it also makes me much more happy in return that I was able to help her and provide support by listening to her problems. I just want to have her understand that somehow. My current plan is to tell her about how I feel in what I've wrote, and that I understand if she doesn't want to open up to me and I will never force her to, but I will always be here for her and that she should know that."

2231,depression,"There's just nothing left for me, I'll never do any of the things I want to, I'll never be free of depression, I'll keep living this exact same shit over and over for the rest of my life","I had dreams once upon a time like anyone else but it doesn't matter now, I'm only 22 but all of them are already impossible. I've ruined my chances of any of them, I've fallen down the wrong path and sometimes you really can't turn back. I won't ever create any of the things I want to, I'll never travel or see any place I want to, I'll never fall in love, never be noteworthy in any way to anyone.



I thought I'd help people, I thought I'd write music or books or make art that people care about, or I thought I'd be a scientist who could help move us forward, I thought I could do SOMETHING. You hear about artists who go through hardships and turn that into creative energy to make amazing things, even if in the moment they were just trying to express themselves. My depression just kills me, I can't do anything, I've essentially given up on music and writing and anything else because I just can't be bothered. I'm stupid and dropped out of college and don't care about science or anything anymore. I just do drugs, sleep and eat and I'm just a shell of who I used to be, and so fucking far from even my LEAST ambitious goal that it's laughable. 


I USED to be smart, creative, charismatic, ambitious, hopeful but what you *used to be* years ago really isn't relevant. 



I won't ever be anyone or do anything that matters, even to one person. I do nothing, I don't even talk to anyone because I just can't. I can't do anything. Any and all energy I ever had has been gone for close to 10 years now.




And now it's led me to a place where definitely none of that shit is possible, I'm just self destructing and I even realize it and see it happening but can't be bothered to care. I've already burned countless bridges and many things already are actually impossible now. I know already but especially further down this path I'll never be desirable to anyone, I'll never achieve anything, never matter at all but again I just can't be bothered to care.



I'll be doing the same shit every day for the rest of my life like everybody else and none of it will matter, to me or anyone else. Soulless, mindless I'm just existing. I go to work where I know I'm just a machine for a $100 billion corporation, then go home, get high, eat, drink, cry, whatever it may be that numbs me in the moment. Repeat tomorrow. 



No goals, dreams, ambitions, plans, desires, anything anymore. My only identity is as a coulda woulda shoulda been and that'll only solidify even more as I go on. 



Don't even say therapy because that doesn't matter either. I've already given it everything. All that creative and ambitious energy I tried to channel into getting better, I tried so FUCKING hard to get better and only ever got worse. 6 therapists, probably 20 medications, psychiatrists, every program and group I could find, hospitalizations, none of it worked. Everyone including this sub likes to say therapy always works and it just absolutely doesn't. 





Lyrics that explain 


""They take your dreams down


And they stick 'em in storage


You can have 'em back, son


When you've paid off your mortgage and loans"" 



""Step into the shadows we could talk addiction,


 when it's harmful where you're going and the


 part of you that know it don't give a fuck"""
2232,depression,Need some tricks and tips :(,"I’ve been living in this black hole for 3-4 years now and I am tired of living the same unhealthy routine everyday. I’m in this vicious cycle that never ends. I’ve been ruining my health and my insides without taking any care of it, taking drugs everyday to “make myself forget about my problems” , being antisocial and not having friends/family members that are by side. Drugs are slowly killing me but it’s the only way I seem to forget about how unhealthy and disgusted I am by myself. I need help but I can’t seem to help myself because i’m afraid and ashamed of everything i’ve done to myself and how toxic I am to myself. I miss multiple days of work cause I either hate myself, don’t want to talk to nobody or abused drugs to the point where I can’t get up the next day.

Nobody bothers to ask me how I am and think i’m doing very well in life cause i’m a happy, caring, (try to be positive) kind of person and try my best to help people around me without thinking and being selfish to myself. I want to be healthy again and gain my strength back enough to make a routine everyday. I want to be able heal every broken pieces of me from the inside out and hopefully find a partner one day when i’m on the right side of the map. 

How does one manage to get better? I start something one day and can’t seem to keep going on the next. I’ve tried to eat healthy and stop fucking my insides up but can’t go day without eating junk food that i’m intolerant to. I don’t thank the people who are close to me and just think about taking drugs and ruining myself. I don’t know what to do anymore, i’m 21 and have a long way to go and I know I cannot stay like this my whole life and I pray to get myself back to normal. It feels like it’ll take years :(."

They won't even talk to the depressed, because it burst their shallow little bubble or force them to admit they're only happy because they're taking what others need with little effort, or in other words, they're parasites on society.  The next time you see a happy person, you should smack them.  They probably deserve it right that second."

 i also recognize that anything i make myself do from that point on will be just as unsatisfying. nothing that i ever do will make me feel more than nothing. that's all i am and ever will be... nothing."

2244,depression,I feel so lost and unable. I just need someone to listen.,"I graduated college a year ago. I suffered from depression throughout college, but I went through with it because everyone, including my therapist, just told me that it will get better after I graduate... that therapist is no longer my therapist. I thought that the consistent mental difficulty I was experiencing was just because of the massive, unending work load that my education was putting on me. I thought that after I graduated with this big shot degree that I would wake up to a whole new world of confidence and opportunity. Maybe that confidence and opportunity is there, but my brain is too fogged out with depression to see it right in front of my face. 

A year has gone by since I achieved that degree, and I’m having an extremely difficult time adjusting to my new life. I haven’t found a job that relates to my degree because I hated the education so much that I thought there was no way in hell I was going to put myself in a career of the same subject, so I lowballed for a construction job because I thought I would like it. Do I like it? I don’t know. My body doesn’t seem to like it, I don’t like the pay, and I’m constantly terrified of doing something wrong. Thinking about something as simple as making a wrong cut on a piece of wood will ruin the next couple hours for me. 

I have no idea where I want to go in life or what I want to do. I’m always afraid of never being able to find my place in life, never succeeding, never being paid what I deserve, never being able to be free from work and the endless grind... but I’m too afraid to make a step that’ll help me in those areas. Not only that, but I’m so lost that I don’t even know where to step. I’m 23 now, I’ll be 24 in a month. Most of my friends have found nice jobs that pay well, and they’re doing awesome engineering stuff because they’re smart as hell. I’m left feeling like a failure because I can’t seem to force myself to do the things that’ll lead to a more successful life. Depression has overloaded my mental capacity for so many years I feel like I’m losing an intellectual ability to function normally. 

My hair is thinning out, I forget things, I can’t do simple math in my head. I can’t learn new things. When I fail at something I hyperbolize it to the extreme and I can’t recover from it for an unnecessary amount of time. I can’t enjoy games very much anymore because not knowing how to do something will send me in a fit and I’ll quit it all together. The thought of work will send my heart through the roof for no damn reason. My dad just retired at 53 from a successful engineering career and while I’m happy for him, my jealousy is immeasurable because I feel like I’ll never be as satisfied and happy with a path in life like he is. 

I feel like my only redeeming quality is that I have a partner that cares and listens to me, god forbid my depression drives her away. Bless her heart. 

I look out on this society we live in and see people working their monotonous jobs their entire life just to barely pay their bare expenses, simple ambulance rides that bring people to bankruptcy, capitalistic architecture that leaves most people begging for scraps. It brings me to tears. I’m at the bottom of it with so many others who will most likely never claw their way out from the bottom.

I just feel lost and hopeless. I have no idea what the future will bring but I am almost never positive about it, I don’t know how I can be."
2245,depression,I don’t know if I have depression or if I am just depressed,"I don’t know if I have depression. I don’t want to live but I don’t want to die. Every time I walk in the kitchen and see a knife I think about how easy suicide would be compared to just living life. Same thing happens when I’m waking down a road and could jump in front of a truck or a train. I have a fucked up brain.

I don’t struggle to get out of bed, I also don’t sleep. I don’t cry often. I don’t exactly feel sad. I do feel angry a lot. When my family starts talking I just want to scream at them, especially my mum. I know they mean well but they need to focus on themselves. My mum is a heavy, heavy smoker and compulsive liar. My brother, almost 13, is never at school. My sister is a year younger than my brother and is just a horrible person. Extremely selfish and not the typical “being a kid” selfish. They all lie about trying to improve themselves, they’re always “trying” but they never do.

I want to leave but my siblings behaviour will just get worse living with our mum. When my sister lived with only me for a few months she was a whole different person. A lovely, sweet, kind and caring young girl. After my nana passed in November my mum and brother moved back home and things are worse than ever.

I don’t sleep anymore, not that I did much before. I feel nothing without a pill or bottle of the cheapest alcohol I can get, usually a 1.5L Smirnoff that doesn’t last long. I don’t even have a job. I “stole” the money (its complicated, its technically my money) to get me fucked up for a few days near Christmas. I’ve been dealing to get some money for more pills and booze, and to save for my brother and sister. I don’t want to be selfish with the money. I know the way I’m getting it is wrong and I hate myself for it but I can’t find a job.

I dropped out of school in grade 10 and I was truant since I started kindergarten. I always did well in school though. I have “tried” finishing school for years but I never attend classes. I know if given the exams I can pass but I never make it that far. It pains me to see my siblings walk a similar path. I figured I would be able to help guide them in the right direction at least but my mum steers them the opposite way.

So, I don’t know if I have depression or if my living situation is just making me depressed. I don’t even know how to find out. This is all I have known for at least 10 years.

I should go to a doctor but I don’t see how they could say that I do or don’t have depression without me moving away and that’s not possible at this point.

That was a long rant."

2247,depression,I need help,"Life has been a little rough lately. I've never had these issues before and they kind of hit me like a truck. I've typically been a perfect student all of my life and online instruction has finally taken its toll on me. My grades dropped to F's and it feels like years of work to catch up.

2248,depression,My life is completely falling apart,"This has been the most fucked up few weeks of my life, and I really need somewhere to get this off my chest. Im 19 years old, and I have suffered with depression for quite a few years but the past couple of weeks have been hell on earth. A few days before Christmas, I unknowingly smoked some laced weed which had 'K2 Spice' in it, a very messed up drug that basically turned me into a zombie for the entire Christmas and New Years period. I was violently ill and a paramedic had to come out to help, and now I have little to no recollection of 2020 other than some very vague memories which is incredibly scary for me. 

This incident has caused me to miss out on my college deadlines which might stop me from being able to get into university, and has made me forget pretty much everything that I had learned at college. Its also stopped me from working and affected my relationship with my family, who now think that I'm some kind of actual drug user instead of just the occasional weed joint that I would sometimes have before, and keep as a secret since I'm not proud of it.

My life is screwed, my head feels so foggy and messed up and I'm feeling more depressed than I have ever been before, what the hell am I supposed to do now? Anyone got any advice for someone recovering from spice use? Thanks for reading."
2249,depression,I just need someone to talk to,I end up posting on all my social medias when I get sad (and admittedly drunk) but what I need is someone to talk to. On socials people like even when they don't wanna talk. Anyone here wanna talk?
2250,depression,I accpeted a part of myself,"So I drink pretty regularly but I'm very careful to not let it affect my life. I told myself I would quit drinking after the new year but yesterday I thought to myself ""why?"". Even during heavy drinking times I make sure I never drink the day before work or plans with friends/family. Why deprive myself of a source of pleasure when it doesn't negatively affect my life?

A small victory but a victory over the brain demons nonetheless."
2251,depression,I’m a disappointment.,"Why is it that I fuck up everything? I can’t do anything right. I’m overly sensitive, I hate myself, and I just have this permanent anger and sadness residing in me. I try and I try and I just keep fucking trying but nothing is ever enough. Everything I do is wrong. I can’t find happiness and everything is just so hard. I mess up everything I touch and I upset my parents constantly. I think it would just be better if I was gone. I can’t do anything right and there’s no point in me being here anymore."

2253,depression,Any depression communities out there that aren’t help/uplift based?,"I don’t have a disease. I don’t have something to be “fixed.” I’m not ungrateful by your views on religion, because they aren’t mine. I just want to be myself somewhere. Talk about my day without getting sugary pep talks back, like someone flashing a light right into your eyes. Somewhere I’m not alone.

I’m sure there’s a better word for that than “depression.” For me, it’s just being human though? And being around people who don’t feel the same way is like walking on eggshells. Being force-fed religion is exhausting. That’s what truly does me harm to my well-being, having to cloak my words in consolation for those who would be offended by the fact that I’m just not happy, nor am I ashamed of it.

I just want somewhere somber and muted...Cozy. And simple as I am. Blunt? Surely I’m not alone in this. Just let me be shrek. I need a swamp.

(Not a Reddit-only search. But preferably something more community-like than someone’s weebly blog with a comment section, as that’s all I’ve found.)"

I just want to be loved just like everyone else. Is that asking too much? I don't know anymore. I honestly just feel empty."
2257,depression,Please help," I fucking hate myself so much. Everything hurts. Every single day I wake up and lay in bed for nearly an hour just trying to deal with the fact that I have to go through another day and amass enough energy even to stand up. I’ve been depressed for the past 6 years and tried to kill myself a year ago. The worst part is I don’t even know why I constantly feel so awful. Even at the “highest” point of my life, where my grades were perfect, I was working out on the daily, eating a healthy diet, consistently interacting with my family and friends, I still despised myself and life. Even now, most things are the same, I just workout less often and don’t eat as well, so then why the fuck do I feel so bad? If everything in my life sounds good, why the fuck does it feel so bad. Every single day I wake up dreading the day. My family loves me, I have plenty of genuine, amazing friends, but everything fucking hurts so bad, and I can’t take it anymore. Every single day feels like torture and all I want to do every single day is just try to kill myself again. I don’t matter, in 500 years no one will remember me, and all we are is a speck floating through space, so what the fuck is the point? Why the fuck should I deal with this fucking stupid pain that has followed me for the past six years for what? I feel so fucking entitled for being so lucky, having loving family and friends, always having food in the house and always having a roof over my head, and yet I’m still suffering for some fucking reason. I’m also terrified of the next few years of my life. Trying to get into a good college, and trying to find what I should be doing in life, and using another four years of my life in miserable school. I don’t know what’s stopped me in the past from just drinking myself to death, and I’m scared because soon I’ll be able to drive and I don’t know what will stop me from just swerving into an oncoming car and ending it there. I don’t get it, I don’t get myself, I don’t understand people, I don’t understand why I’m like this. Even when I try my absolute hardest to just tell people about this, I don’t know why, but I just can’t. Even one of my friends who was essentially the only person who knew who I really felt and that I attempted suicide I now just can’t tell how I still feel no matter how hard I try. I’ve also manifested this disgusting concept of happiness, where I feel like the only key to it is for a girl to love me, which leads to me borderline obsessing over girls who I’ve barely talked to and don’t know well. Thank god I haven’t done like real creepy shit yet, it’s essentially just daydreaming about dating them, but I’m scared it’s going to get worse in the future and I won’t have the self awareness to see what I’m doing. I just feel so disgusted by myself for what I do. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just fucking hate my life so much."

2260,depression,Doesn't this place hurt you a little bit?,"I understand that for most of us, the primary feeling we experience at our worst is lonelyness. And it can help to know that there are others out there going through the same thing.

But for me, seeing it all stings horribly. Witnessing the fact that the world has made so many others feel this way is proof enough that no matter what walk of life you come from, it will still take you. Listening to people that have been struggling for their entire lives if proof enough that no matter how long you hold out, it will still take you.

The horror at realising that so many people can relate to these feelings I have make me want to throw up. It's not suppossed to be this way. I hate that you all have to suffer this way, too. I hate all we can do for each other is ruminate about how shitty things are and will continue to be. It's cruel enough that I ended up this way, but it's unspeakable that so many others have too.

This sub is a very good place that *needs* to exist, but I can't get over the mixed feelings it gives me. On one hand: validation and community. I get to feel as though I am not alone. We are all trapped, but at least we are trapped together. On the other hand: overwelming despair and rage at the futility of the situation. The realization that, no matter what, the world will always push people to become like this. The heartbreak that there are hundreds of thousands of us, suffering with no end in sight. And all we can do it swap scars and hope that it gets better for even one of us. I hate witnessing all this despair and seeing that it eclipses the meager sadness that I've felt in my life. Couple that with the fact that I can't do anything to help and the whole thing seems so hopeless."

As for movement I can walk and everything but I get really sore really easy. I don't know what to do I want to fix all of this but I'm in such a horrible situation at home I can't get perfesional help and anything I do is meet with criticism and harassment I'm to the point where it seems better for me to just kill myself....
2266,depression,I dont want to kill myself yet but i have no idea how to continue and live life again. Ideas are much appreciated and needed.,"TLDR: i am completely alone in life living by myself, suffer from mentall illnesses and have zero idea to what to do in life. How to continue?

I dont know whats the point of my post. I guess this is just a rant.
I am 24M living alone without gf, friends or family.
I have depression, ADHD, anhedonia, OCD and derealization. My biggest moments in my days are
1. When i shower
2. and when i go to the grocery store
Other than that i just lay on my bed watching movies and videos. 

Only useful thing i do is that i run 5 times a week on my treadmill to lose weight and to feel better. I have been overweight for two years now. Gained 50kg in two years because of depression. But i dont think losing weight is going to help me much because i was severely depressed at a healthy weight.

I have tried ~10 different kinds of medications for depression, OCD and anxiety. Nothing helps with this weird emptiness feeling. This ”void” i call it. I have tried SSRIs, SNRIs, NDRI, benzos and few ADHD medications. Nothing helps. Therapy doesnt help me either. Not at all. I have tried 4 different kinds of them. Its advices are basically ”fake it till you makeit” and i never learn anything i dont already know there.

I dont know what to do in life anymore. I just feel that i want to drink my worries away every night. Im not addicted but drink few times a week because im going crazy from the loneliness and the boderom.

I feel like i cant study or go to work anymore. What can i do in life? I would make a bet that depression has made severe and permanent damage to my brain.
I dont want to kill myself yet but i dont see any other way."
2267,depression,I am wasting people's time.,I am a burden. It's time I removed myself from the equation.
2268,depression,"If it constantly comes and goes, is it really depression?","Right now I feel fine. Despite the dreadful feeling that I'll have to leave my home and go to uni with the situation the UK is in right now, I'd say the past month was alright. I had therapy somewhere around the beginning of December for the last time and I almost couldn't say anything bad because I was in such a good state of mind.
However, it has happened before. I'm good for a week, month, even a whole season and on the back of my mind there's always something telling me I should worry, but I'm 100% capable to ignore it. Then, in just a day or two, I become numb - like emotions, people, world events, news don't touch me at all, it's like I'm living in a little glass cage and the world around me is just scenery I get to look at but not feel or touch. That's when my mind kind of shuts down and I become a shell, like I talk to people and laugh and clean and cook and study but nothing touches me. It doesn't feel like that right now, but I feel it creeping in, probably like a defence reaction against the change of scenery when I go back to uni.
And I can't help but feel guilty. If I get to have good moments, am I really allowed to be depressed? Do I get an ""unfair advantage""? I'm confused, but at the same time I still go to therapy and I'm afraid it's like I'm not supposed to? I want to feel heard, that's all, but I can't if I'm feeling numb. Right now would be the best time to talk about this, but my next session isn't until the middle of January. So I decided to write here. Sorry if this is too chaotic, I can't really wrap my mind around it."

2270,depression,I got my heart broken and failed 3/4 of my university units this year.,"Here goes. I need help. 

I've been doing nothing for the past two months. I'm in holiday break from university. 

This year in 2020, I really struggled. 

Mid-way through the year, I found out that the guy I was dating, was already dating someone else, during the time period when he said he was ""still interested in me but needed space and time"". It really broke me when I found out. I didn't eat for days and didn't have the motivation to do anything. 

That really knocked the wind out of me. It had an effect on my grades. It didn't really help that this was by far the hardest units I've taken so far in uni. 

I worked so damn hard throughout the year. I was in so much stress. At the end of it all, it wasn't enough. I failed 3/4 of my units. 

But you know what, I tried my best. There was nothing more I could do. But still. That launched into an even greater depression. Where ive just been at home for two months doing nothing. All of my plans this break, just disappeared. 

But I'm trying to pick myself up. First was journalling my feelings like this. It really has helped me. I'm also reaching out to people, and telling them how I feel. Getting help us good."
2271,depression,Is this really depression?,"I still laugh. Laugh a lot. I have a job, stays with family, have some friends which I share my crappy, lame humour with. I can play games with others, just recently fallen out of love because I was low-key rejected but we're still friends in the same social group.

But when I'm alone, I cant really smile. I laugh at memes and jokes, and watches funny vids too. But I don't feel..happy. I feel as though I'm hollow, that I'm lonely and just very anxious or fear or even just sad. But my friends and family don't ever know about this, I hide it really well like I put up the best smile outside and laugh the loudest but deep down, I feel really empty. 

I don't even know what this is? Is this really depression? It's not like I can't socialise, and I still work and communicate with others and my colleagues often but no matter what I do, I feel so empty deep down. Like it's just hollow and nothing I do fits into it."

I've got about 5 people who would be sort of sad if I died on top the 2 people who I don't want to be hurt by finding me dead upstairs. But they are standoffish most of the time. Everyone is.

I really don't feel suicidal right now, but I use to feel it all the time in the past. It's been probably a month since I felt very suicidal, but I really feel like I should be suicidal. 

I feel that I deserve to be suicidal, that I don't really deserve to be happy or even be okay. It's not even just feeling that I deserve this, I want it. I think I shouldn't be here, I think I need to be gone. I really don't have a lot of worth, and I'm not looking forward to this year. I really should be suicidal.

Look I'm going to be honest, I think life is a complete waste of time. If I had just ended my life two decades ago I could have avoided so much crap. I'm sorry but I'm really starting to wonder what the point of this all is. Some ideas I've wanted to use for such a long time but I've always been afraid to, because that's how anxiety works. I don't want to run away with my imagination, but one day I also think I might have no choice. A lot of things are difficult to explain, which is just one of many reasons as to why I don't think I'm in the right family, or on the right planet."

I feel like deep down, I have an alternate motive thats just faking it, heck, half the things I do I feel like I made them on purpose, but I feel like it’s natural,  I keep gaining weight but I’m starting to eat two times a day. I feel as if I don’t matter in front of people, I’m too self conscious about myself, but, I try to lie to myself and tell myself that I’m just weak, that I need to get back up because I’m just a pussy, it works, but lately, that’s stopped working more and more too.

I'm hurting so much. i can't tell anyone whats going on with me because if i get any doubt about my experience or my mental state i feel i will crumble beyond repair but i so desperately want to relate to others and understand that what happened and how it affects me is not my fault. I'm so scared that after the therapy im going through, nothing will change. i'll remain an unmotivated, anxious, depressed shell of the person i was meant to be and i can't live like that. i can't live life in this eternal hell of guilt and shame. i just want to be at peace. i'm tired of the past having its grip on me.i just want to be haappy.

2288,depression,Burnt out and numb,"Sometimes I feel like my brain just does not want to let me progress. Whenever I take up on a new activity and find a little bit of motivation to move my life in the right direction, there is this weird feeling that creeps up on me and starts pulling me back into a shitty, non-energetic slump. 

I started university this year and despite the pandemic, I was extremely motivated and ready to learn. That didn't last long. Now I can barely bring myself to do the bare minimum, always right before the deadlines. 

I got a good part time job two months ago. The same story. Started out happy and excited and with a good work ethic. Now it feels like a chore and I've already had to use several excuses to miss my shift just because I am extremely mentally exhausted. 

I don't know what to do. This has already sabotaged me in the past and I feel like sooner or later it could happen yet again. Whenever I seem to be finding a grip on life, I struggle to hold on. It feels like I am observing all of this from a different point of view, yet I cannot interfere. 

My enthusiasm and motivation does not last long. The hobbies I once enjoyed and used to take my mind off things have now lost some of that spark and my brain has started suggesting other forms of brief serotonin release such as cigarettes, alcohol, and weed. Talking to people I'm close to also feels like a chore at times, and I am unable to form deep &amp; meaningful romantic bonds despite wanting to and having the opportunity. 

I see all these happy people and I would like to think that I am one of them. But deep down I know that I'm not. While I have not had suicidal thoughts in a while now, I feel like I'm not living like I should be. I feel like I'm in a slump that has been disguised to make it not seem like one. But it is. 

I'm terrified of the future and resentful of the past. I just want stability. I just want to feel carefree. I want to feel like I'm enjoying life and its opportunities properly. But I'm just so low on energy. It feels like I'm just going through the motions."
2289,depression,i’m starting to realize this shit is really never ending.,"i thought i’d grow out of it or something i guess. 7 years of hospitals, therapists, and pills but i lose more hope for myself every day. i’m 20 and i have no quality of life in my mind. i don’t have passions or desires. it’s a chore to get out of bed most days. doing trivial tasks exhausts me. i can’t get a job because i have panic attacks thinking about going to interviews. i’ve had jobs before but i’ve quit them all or just stopped showing up. i dropped out of college because i don’t want to do anything with my life and i have no drive or energy to put into it. thinking about picking a “lifelong career” overwhelms me because i thought i would be dead before 18 so i never gave it much thought. i’m living with my parents again which is hell and i’m broke because i spend the little money i make (from doordash driving on my good days) on drugs because i don’t think i’ll live long enough for it to amount to anything if i saved it. i know there are people who have it worse for me but i honestly have little empathy for them. i don’t think i’m a bad person but my mental illnesses make me mean and undesirable to be around, to say the least. i know i stress everyone out in my life but they know how i am and they should just stop caring. if anyone gets too close to me i push them away or ghost them or intentionally fuck the entire friendship/relationship up. i hurt people to get them to leave and then complain about how alone i am. i barely eat or sleep so my body will collapse and i will be no more eventually anyway. i like that option more because then i’ll be deemed as physically ill rather than someone who took the easy way out of life because they couldn’t find anything worth staying for. thanks for coming to my ted talk"

So, I'm easily attracted to toxic relationships, and the worse they treat me, the more I will be there, and they know it.

I live alone, my family lives states away, my boyfriend moved away, and my friends don't want to see me because my job leaves me somewhat vulnerable to COVID exposure. Everyone is busy with their own lives, and I get it. Talking to me isn't exactly fun these days. So every day after work I come home to a quiet and empty apartment. Every weekend I wait around for the day to end so I can go to sleep. 

Honestly, I just want to die. I think about it every day. I'd never actually harm myself because I know what it would do to my loved ones, and most days that's the one thing that keeps me safe. I couldn't make my sister lose Dad and me in the same year. But in some way I feel resentful, too. I'm staying alive for people that can't or won't be here for me when I need them. 

I'm doing everything I can to claw my way out of this,  but it's getting so hard. It feels like I'm losing my mind. I thought that I had gotten stronger while dealing with the grief of my dad's loss but now I can barely take care of myself.  I don't know what to do."
2294,depression,for the first time,"is it possible to do self harm and not be depressed? There are moments I feel happy and content with myself but sometimes I feel like such a burden. I cut myself a few times and I felt nothing. For the first time, I wasn’t focused on how much of a burden I was... actually I wasn’t really thinking at all. It’s a haze and I don’t really know how I did it. But it was such a nice release, like a hug you didn’t know you needed."
2295,depression,I fear I might have a mild case of depression.,"I've been feeling down for a while now - lost my job early this year thanks to Covid, got into a relationship that didn't work out, I'm basically stuck looking for a job, I feel like a sucker whenever I apply to positions online and do all those fucking tests since I get ghosted most of the time.

I'm starting to feel incompetent, sometimes I forget stuff from my uni times (which is natural since I'm not using it in a daily basis, thanks to having no work) and I instantly spiral down to feeling useless, I'm often comparing myself to others on my field and feeling downright incapable of doing what they do due to the aforementioned forgetfulness.  

Due to that, I went to the NHS's website (not british but hey, it's trustworthy) and I've checked every single box there. No suicidal thoughts at all, thankfully."
2296,depression,I’m constantly numb and it’s turned me into a monster.,"Hey. I’m an 18f and if you stumble across this and choose to read it fully, thank you. If you don’t that’s fine to. I just need to get this out here since I obviously can’t tell anyone I’m my inner circle.

I was diagnosed with severe paranoid delusions and anxiety when I was 15. It was so bad to the point where every few months I became paranoid about a specific thing.

It started with the cops. When I was 13. I thought the cops were gonna come for me for stealing stuff at the mall a year prior. I became so paranoid I would scream and pray to god to make it go away.

Fast forward to 16 I became paranoid after watching one YouTube video that I had cancer and I was dying. I thought my rib that was sticking out of my stomach was a tumor. I forced my parents to take me to the doctor and nothing. But that didn’t stop my anxiety. 


I would be awake till 6am every night scratching my legs and then picking at the scabs I created. At one my point my friends dad asked if I got attacked my a cat on my legs. I don’t remember what I told him but I knew then that it was bad. The paranoid thoughts eventually morphed into a year and a half long eating disorder. Diagnosed as ednos. Since I had bulima tendencies, counted calories, anorexia tendencies and binge eating tendencies. 


Flash forward one more time to now, almost 19 years old that anxiety is gone. I don’t remember when it stopped and I don’t remember how it felt. I can recall those memories but I can’t remember how it felt in any way. 

I realized I was “numb” when nothing gave me excitement. And when nothing scared me. I thought I was falling out love with my boyfriend until I realized I feel the same numbness towards everyone in my life.


It’s gotten to the point that I make friends who I know will be toxic, so I can live off their exciting crazy lives. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve become the crazy friend. I’m constantly creating drama, constantly feeding off toxic people. And I love it.


I love the short lived rush I get from fighting, arguing, creating chaos. And I’m worried. I can’t say I’m scared because I don’t feel anything. But I know I’m worried. 

I don’t know what this is gonna lead to next. 


My depression has made me evil."
2297,depression,My boyfriend has been getting worse.,"My boyfriend has been getting the shit end of the stick for years. And it only seems to get worse. He recently had been starting to give up after losing his last ex, an ingrown toenail, terrible parents, and an eye problem that has been impacting him doing things on the computer.
He reminds me that I am the only reason he is even alive anymore.

I keep feeling like I'm losing more and more of him and more of my own psychological health. 

I need advice. I just want to help him and life keeps shitting all over the both of us. Please just tell me what I can do to start feeling better and more in control."
2298,depression,It’s been been almost 4 days since I’ve wanted to kill myself,I haven’t felt suicidal in almost 4 days. I’m very proud of myself I’m getting better for not only me but the people I’m surrounded by.
2299,depression,I don't know how to feel anymore after today.,"I'm a guy, I'm 21, I struggle with horrible depression episodes, stress issues and anxiety and not having any motivation to go do much. I've been trying to work on myself and For the first time in 5 years I met a girl who lived literally 1 minute away. We talked and ended up going on a small date and it ended with her kissing me and saying they'll see me again. After that it's been almost a week and they've just vanished. My first time feeling love in over 5 years and it's gone and ruined. I've spent so long trying to get a funny personality and be kind. It feels like imma failure , everything I've done to myself these last few years was thrown out and I'm nothing. I can't take it anymore. All I do is try and nobody ever needs me. Nobody ever accepts me or will be with me. All I want is the feeling of affection and like I matter more than just a friend. It's so hard for people to understand how truly outcasted someone can feel. Maybe someone will message me cause of this post , idk, thanks for reading"
2300,depression,finally got a job after 6 months of being unemployed and now I don't work for another 3 weeks,"like the title says, I got let go from my old job of 7 years in June due to a combination of personal issues and poor judgement from management and I finally managed to get a new one a couple of weeks ago, I thought things were finally going to turn around and I was going to be able to interact with other humans without trying to sell myself to a hiring manager for the first time in half a year (I'm in university but they switched all their courses to an online format), but then I wound up losing 3 of the 5 shifts I was scheduled for due to new coronavirus restrictions implemented by my Provence (due to a predicted spike in cases over the winter) and I'm not working again until at least after christmas, just when I thought I was finally going to be able to start having something resembling a life again I get pulled right back to where I started, what's even the point in trying if I'm always just going to wind up sitting at home for the foreseeable future?"
2301,depression,I'm in the worst headspace I've ever been.,"I can’t help but feel unlucky that I was ever born. The good in life just doesn’t outweigh the bad. The struggle is not worth the reward. Even on a day where nothing seemingly goes wrong--my intrusive thoughts aren’t terrible and my OCD isn't acting up--there’s a looming feeling of doom that dominates my mind. Something terrible could happen and I would have expected it. Because why could there ever be a perfect day? Why could there ever be a day where everything’s alright? I think a lot about how I wish I could kill myself. It would have just been easier if I drowned in the ocean when I was an infant before the reality of my situation settled in and I became a bitter fuck. I can’t tell myself everything’s okay because I *know* it’s not. Something’s seriously wrong with me. Is it a chemical imbalance? Am I predisposed to feel this way? Was I doomed to feel like this since birth? Will it ever go away? I find it hard to describe how I feel to a therapist. All I know is that I need help but I don’t know what someone else’s advice could ever do for me. I’m in hell. This is my hell. A world where you’re “supposed” to be happy and everyone puts on the front that they are. And I’m sure some of them are. But then there’s people like me--the people who just can’t get over the terrible no matter how hard they try to distract themselves from it. I’m irritable, miserable, self-loathing, judgmental, a loser, a loner, and a piece of shit. I’m trapped in this skin and I hate it here but I can’t get out. Life has been a fog since I was 13 and it just. Never. Ends. I do anything I can to get a release. I’ll do anything for a way out of my head. And the only time I’m at peace is when I’m asleep. That’s why I do it so much. It’s why I think I’d be better off dead. If only I were anyone but me. If I were anywhere else. If I could just be someone else for a day. I need a perspective that's different from my own. Because I know no matter what I’m trapped in this shell, I had no say in it, and I just have to make it work. Who knew life could be so shitty? And at the end of it all I’m just going to suffer through tragedy and eventually die. All because I just fucking appeared on this shitshow of a planet and my consciousness plopped into this shithole of a body. Oh how lovely it would be to be anywhere but here. In this moment in time. What a twisted son of a bitch I am.

Best wishes, yours truly

2302,depression,I try so hard but I still feel like people would be better off without me,"I know people love and care about me...but I still feel like they'd be better off without me...like no matter what I'll just never be good enough...and they'd be much better without me.
I've been having days again...where I kind of wish I wouldn't wake up. I could just not have to try anymore, and not worry about disappointing anyone...."
2303,depression,Hate,"I hate myself. I hate my life. I have changed jobs, careers, homes, roommates and partners. The problem is me. I hate myself because of myself. I have to suffer every day. I can't get disability due to wanting to hang myself every day, so my only reason to work is so I don't die a slow death of starvation. I do not matter and wish I had been successful with my attempt when I was in high school. Would have saved me so many years of suffering. It'll be a decade later this month since the first time I promised myself that I would kill myself one day. A worthless decade."
2304,depression,I’m just sad.,"Girl I’m talking to and the only person I’ve ever loved were together for about 4 years before taking a break-up due to some differences and some arguments at the time. (Started dating in high school and were each other’s first kisses and dates etc)

After 8 months of being apart we got together again and have been talking on and off for about a year now. And seen each other a couple times and spent a few nights together over that time. I asked her recently if she had been with anyone while we were apart and initially said yes but it was just one kiss and said nothing else happened when I asked if it was making out or anything like that. 

I felt like she was hiding something but I let it go. The next night I asked further and it changed to making out but standing up and only lasted a few seconds. Today I asked and it turned to clothes off and full makeout session lying down on a bed. each time she adds more and more to the story. 

The fact that she did something when she was single doesn’t bother me as much as the lying and hiding from me. But I feel betrayed she didn’t tell me upfront back in February when we started talking again and we talked about laying everything on the table if we were gonna start things up again. And all the nights we spent together she didn’t say anything. And then she lied and said it was nothing until it got full blown makeout session with clothes off in a bed. I just feel sad and betrayed she lied so much."
2305,depression,It's already December in the year 2020...,"This is really concerning and very scary. Wasn't it just January yesterday? If time keeps going by this quickly I'll never be able to pull myself out of this hell before it's WAY past too LATE. Is anybody else experiencing this? How it feels like just yesterday it was January? What's up with this, I'm becoming very discouraged by this unrelenting realization, because last year this happened to me too... Oooooooh shit."
2306,depression,I don’t know what to do,"I don’t want to die but I don’t know how to stay alive- I’ve drank more than enough tonight to be numb but yeah, and I just don’t want to wake up in the morning. My wife asked me what’s wrong but I can’t open up. I just want to vent. But I feel like I can’t. I don’t know what my problem is. I shouldn’t feel this way, but I can’t fix myself. I don’t know if this is being suicidal but I know I could take the prescriptions in the house and just stop- just stop. That’s what I want to do. Honestly I’m just venting nothing, and I need a place to do that- I’ll be here in the morning. I have no plans- sorry."
2307,depression,"I'm tired of opening up to people, but I feel so alone. I'm not like anyone I've ever met.","I keep typing messages to people, that turn into paragraphs and then back into a empty text box with a blinking cursor. 

I'm tired of pouring out my feelings for nobody to understand. I know they check up on me, but ik they don't care. I know it's not the depression making me think that, so don't even say it, they really don't care. 

Maybe I'll never have anyone."
2308,depression,"""mental health day""",where I live it's completely acceptable to take a day off work and call it a mental health day just so you can relax and prevent yourself from feeling worse later in the week ect. as someone who battles everyday with getting out of bed and working 9hr days 6 days a week I find this kind of insulting to some degree. about twice a mount I'll take a half or full day of work and spend 80% of it sleeping so I have enough energy to keep going. If I took a mental health day everyday I felt like I was gonna kill myself on the way to work or not come back after lunch and jump off a bridge I'd be unemployed. this is the first job I've had in a while and I'm trying so hard to not go back to being bed locked but my mental health just isnt up there and I need the money even though I have no free time to enjoy it. fuck.
2309,depression,lonely and depressed,"I don't know how to start this or how to finish it, and sorry in advance for just ranting but here it goes. 

Am just tierd and sick of life it has no meaning and its just endless pain and disappointment i don't know why am still alive I thought about ending it all but am too much off a p***y to do it.
I just want some peace and this depressed feelings to come to an end I want to feel happy for once and not worry that am gonna be sad after 2 minutes,  I see other people laugh, smile and enjoying thier life and I envy them and I feel like s***t for being jealous of them becasue I just want be happy like them,
All my hobbies and things I liked just became stall and I don't enjoy them anymore I remember the last time I enjoyed anything was 9 years ago, everytime I try a new thing I enjoy it for the first 30 minutes and then back to the void inside me and the depressed thoughts that linger in the back of my head.
I have no friends and my family is broken and hate each other I have no one to go to.
I bottled all this up for 21 years I just wanted someone to listen because I can't keep it in anymore
Am gonna finish this bottle of vodka and hope not wake up.

2310,depression,I would rather kill myself than work full time in an office full time for the rest of my life.,"I really feel like this. People think I’m joking but I just seriously hate offices. 

Last time I worked in an office I would have a mental breakdown and cry in my car every morning. 

But food service barely pays enough to live in my city. I’m so depressed right now."
2311,depression,Desiring death,"I find it remarkable how many of us want to die, when so many people who want to live are dying from Covid. 

It's sad that happy, strong, productive, loving individuals pass away leaving a huge hole in their community,  but sick minded, ungrateful, self-loathing, complainers live on to complain and be self-absorbed. 

Too bad, viruses don't take out those who really want to die and leave the others alone. 

I've been psychotic this week, still am. Thoroughly bonkers activity and dangerous choices have filled my mind and my days. I have my masters IN PSYCHOLOGY even. Oh, how life mocks me.

I am craving a sadist to beat the living shit out of me, cut me up, whatever, and bring me to the brink of death. I actually put out a call in the sadist sub, and elsewhere,  WTF? I know better, but I left a not so obvious personal info trail. 

My demented mental illness, I'm bipolar 2, had me hallucinating and thinking that if someone did this to me, maybe I would feel alive again. Maybe I could be free of the darkness and relentless thoughts? And if they killed me while doing it, I'm fine with that too. 🙄

I get so crazy. I feel so undeserving of life. My death should be as brutal and raw as my life has been, and my ungratefulness is deserving of punishment. 😔"
2312,depression,My life is so lonely and empty,"(F 20) Everyday feels like same, everything just repeats and it’s driving me crazy. Anytime a minor inconvenience happens I immediately think to end my life, and I hate that that’s what my brain resorts to everytime. I hate feeling this way, I feel so unloved and unwanted. I know myself and I know that I’m too scared to go through with it, but I’m also scared of what will happen the day where I just can’t take it anymore."
2313,depression,I cant talk to people anymore and my life's going nowhere,"All my life I always avoided social situations that's why I dont really gained much friends. I don't know why but I just dont want to talk to anyone. It makes me nervous like a panic attack cause I don't know what to say. But the guilt of not talking to people makes me feel like a shitty useless person cause honestly I don't know if I should have been born in this world. I feel like I would be like this forever and unhappy for the rest of my life. I'm not really growing nor living, I'm just trying to survive everday and let days pass me by. This too shall pass but it's been too long and I don't know if how much days I have left:("
2314,depression,TLDR at the bottom (sorry it’s a long and pretty unfocused one),"Sup my fellow homies with “The Big Sad”? Humor is a coping mechanism of mine. I’ve got Bipolar 1, and ADHD. I came here as opposed to r/bipolar just because the depression aspect of my diagnosis has had the biggest effect on my life and perspective. 
I’ve gotten rid of the more emotional aspects of depression but I still feel the mental exhaustion caused by depression and overstimulation from ADHD, the aches and pains, and worst of all the apathy. I have no clue what I want to do at all. I have these brief moments of clarity in which I feel insane fear, guilt, and self hatred but they pass within 2 minutes. 
I was born into literally the best of circumstances, White male, parents are together and never fight, siblings I actually like, objectively fairly attractive and insanely creative and intelligent. Even in my battle with my mental illnesses I’m grateful for the perspective it has given me on others, I can walk in others shoes, I can come up with a solution to so many complicated issues, I have ideas to reform education, government, economies. I have ideas of colonizing the galaxy and bending the laws of reality itself. I am literally built to do the impossible, to create but no one wants these traits, I feel like I can’t even hope to begin actually using my strengths. The concept of compromise and settling with a situation is what got me in a depressed situation and it’s what everyone one tells me I have to do. It’s is death. How do I get the drive back and the vision of how to utilize my abilities. If I can get it back I’ll win against depression, bipolar, ADHD. I don’t want life to be easy, quite the opposite actually, I just want to feel like the struggle is worth it. 

TLDR: Objectively won the genetic, family, natural talent and intelligence lottery. I’ve got everything going, I was literally able to make my anxieties go away by getting addicted to the adrenaline, but I’m 23 with nothing to show for, and I can’t bring myself to care."
2315,depression,I don't wont to anymore,"When I was 16 I broke inside. I gave up on life. I gave up on being happy. I gave up on myself. Too much abuse in my childhood home. I tried to kill myself with no success. I'm haunted by my childhood. I see my my abusers in the mirror every day and hear their voice when I speak. 
I hate myself and my life. I have changed my home, career, industry, and my partner. I still hate myself because the problem is with me. I am as broken and useless as my parents told me on a weekly basis (it feels like it was daily but I know it wasn't. I didn't speak to my parents as much as possible. Can't abuse me if I do interact with you.) 
I'm probably trans, I'm still not sure as my parents beat and berated me until I learned how to, ""act like a real boy."" I don't know where I begin and the act ends at this point. If I transition I put a target on my back and if I don't I feel locked inside my body like it's a prison. 
So my body is a prison, I'm haunted by my childhood, and I hate myself no matter what. I wish I was successful in my youth. I'm coming up on a decade since I tried and the last ten years have been shit. They have not been worth living and at a certain point it is not worth waiting for things to, ""just get better,"" they do not. 
I woke up one morning last month with terrible chest pain. I thought I was having a heart attack and all I felt was relief that my suffering was over. I didn't. Don't know why I felt so much pain, but I don't care. It didn't kill me."
2316,depression,Are these all the fundamentals for overcoming depression?,"I used to be immensely depressed, but I've been changing so much and I'm feeling much better about life.

2317,depression,For the first time I feel serious about suicde,"Disclaimer: I do have depression and I recently went through a breakup, and I know what it feels like to have clinical depression rather than just having “the blues”. It’s not just my depression and the break up though, I really want to kill myself. I don’t like being human. I meditate often and I want to be in the state of pure awareness or something like that permanently. I mean I really love my family and friends otherwise I would have done it already. I feel like acting on impulses because I’ve gone through this an innumerable amount of times (though not in this intensity) in my teenage life (i am still a teen btw) and ive never done anything. I just don’t want to keep going in and out of this state of being depressed and content over and over. I guess the best way of putting it is I don’t want to die but I don’t want to be alive. I want to take up Buddhism because it seems like a stress free simpler way of life but I know that even then your aren’t “fixed” or put in that state of pure awareness constantly. The way I see it is that death is like sleep so if you die there will be no suffering and that seems perfect to me. I don’t know what to do, I don’t want my friends and family to hurt because of me but I don’t want to suffer at all anymore. Please help me I don’t know how to get out of this, I’m already doing therapy and I don’t want medication. I don’t know what I’m asking for either but I just need some way to get out of this suffering. And please don’t ignore this because I’m a teen or some shit either this sucks for me and I’m just as valuable and human as you are."

She feels tired as she can no longer feel like she can believe a word i say because i've only promised improvement but have done shit. She feels like i never love her because if i did i would have never lied or hide anything from her. I cannot even face her because while i do truly feel like i love her i also feel like she is right and im questioning everything about myself.

I never in my wildest dreams ever thought as an adult I would have a year or time at all that was worse, more painful, more life destroying, more awful than what I’ve been through. I am usually very positive actually. I usually am like listen this is going to pass it will get better. This year basically killed my soul. I have never felt a depression like this. I feel like I have no way out. I looked to everyone I thought I could click with and enjoy my time since I’ve been miserable and each person screwed me over. That’s not the worst. I’ve had horrible health issues, career issues, and just overall my life feels like it will actually not get better. Even if it does I already have PTSD and I’m noticing thoughts from certain events of this year give me really bad feelings and anxiety. If I could talk to a higher being that could help all I’d beg is for this to stop. I’m so scared that no matter what strides I make I will come back to this feeling. I don’t wish this on anyone. Nobody understands especially because I’m mostly someone who seems happy how not good I am. I know we’re all struggling but I was tested by this world from birth to 16, I never thought I’d face such pain. It’s so bratty and entitled to say it’s not fair. I know I have made mistakes this year I never normally would have. I know I’m not perfect at all but I can’t take much more... I know I can’t. I just want to be good. I’m also mad at the people even just people I talk to enough for not checking up or trying at all? I always have for everyone. I’m not going to kill myself okay. But people are so quick to say if only we did something when they were alive. People are alive before they take that step and I feel like people forget that. I’m almost at a loss for words... I see no light at the end of the tunnel. I’ve never not had hope. Now I am so unhopeful. If I say this to anyone I’m being dramatic and a downer. I’m just not me anymore. I feel like someone took my joy, soul, and will to be here and burned it. Depression has always been with me but it’s never been closer to me."

I do not like self diagnosing so i am not say that i 100% have it. ever since covid and this school year started i have feel really sad i cry a lot, i have suicidal thoughts a lot when i’m sad i have this weird feeling in my chest like i can’t breath and someone is sitting on my chest and my head will start hurting, i have been in a lot of denial of everything snd that i’m not actually sad i’m just trying to make people feel bad about me and a lot of other things i emailed my school emotional counselor but i am so terrified because she is obviously going to tell my parents i don’t like when people worry about me. why do i feel this way?? what do i do??"
2330,depression,I cant stop beating myself up...,I mean this literally. Anytime I mess up even a little I can't help but just hit myself at this point. I don't know how long I can go before I start cutting again. I'm such a stupid failure piece of shit. My parents should be glad if I suddenly die in my sleep or in a car crash. Im nothing but a burden. Im sorry if this is pointless but I had to vent this out somewhere.
2331,depression,(24F) I’ve been feeling suicidal for so long and I don’t know if it will ever stop,"Edit: I have a shorter straight to the point version at the bottom.

I’m sorry in advance if this is long but I appreciate anyone who fully reads this. I would love some advice but would also love to hear others experiences to know I’m not alone. Please no direct messages, I’ve already had too many encounters of redditors being inappropriate. If you’re someone who is lurking around this sub just looking for someone vulnerable to prey on, sincerely fuck you.

So I have always had some form of depression or anxiety for as long as I could remember. I was always reserved as a child and always found it hard to make friends. I always felt like a freak around others, like I wasn’t even a person sometimes. My suicidal thoughts invade my mind on a daily bases, especially when I start to think about the future and what I’m going to do. I still live at home and just graduated but I’m worried about not landing a job because of my lack of experience and because it is a male dominated field (mechanics). The only thing that seems to keep me grounded and not feeling completely invisible are my dog and cat. My dog is adopted and has severe anxiety especially around people. My kitten I found in my garage early October. I’ll post the pet tax below.

But it especially hits when I start to have feelings for someone. In general my social anxiety isn’t as bad as it use to be, because of my distain for other humans I’ve learn to just ignore them and not acknowledge them. Only if I’m being greeted by employees, old people, or children. Otherwise I keep my headphones in and eyes on my phone. But every now and then I’ll see a guy who’s my type and all of a sudden this feeling of butterflies fluttering hit me followed by this weird high as a kite feeling. But not even a minute later reality sets in and it all comes crashing down. I will then have this overwhelming feeling of wanting to hide, my self awareness is heightened, and my self esteem just goes completely to shit. 

Then the suicidal feelings set in. The feeling of being unworthy, undesirable, ugly, and a freak. I’ll feel this intense feeling of shame. My mind screams at me “how dare you have these feelings”, “you are a joke to think anyone could ever actually want you”, “no one deserves to have to settle with such an ugly, plain, and obnoxious person like you”.

More and more of these thoughts will just pile on top of each other and it doesn’t stop. The only way to get it to stop is to just avoid being around men that I could potentially catch feelings for. But the worst part is that sometimes I’ll be around a guy at work or school, and at first I won’t really feel attracted and things will be fine. We’ll just start off as friends, but then if this guy shows any sort of human decency or kindness towards me I start to panic and have these feelings. I have to keep reminding myself that my feelings are wrong and that the guy would never want to be with me. I’ll even have to give myself fake reasons to why he might actually be a bad person. I’ll have to make up shit in my head that he might actually be abusive or a complete asshole behind closed doors. A wolf in sheep’s clothing, no matter how genuine or sweet he might seem. 

It doesn’t matter how much I fall for the guy, I always force myself to shove it down and keep it hidden. I’ve already been rejected enough times to learn my lesson. I’ve only had one bf ever of 2 yrs, and it was miserable. He was barely 18 when I met him at work and I was 21. I know it sounds wrong but at the time he was the only guy ever to show interest and I was desperate. He started out nice but he was really into drugs and looking back I feel like he was really just using me financially and because he didn’t have a car or license. He started using heroine and couldn’t keep a job. He would get so high and tweaky that it felt like I was with a zombie. Once I finally broke up with him he turned it all on me, saying I never loved him, I was just using him (I don’t even know where this came from, I was basically his care taker). Whenever I would confront him about his issues he would always say that I had anger issues, a joy kill, and didn’t know about drugs like he did. He would always make me feel like the bad person and in return I would always feel guilty for being a bad gf and how I should have done better and more for him. I would even do some drugs with him to be the “cool gf”. I did molly, lsd, xanax, and aderal. I was actually starting to get addicted to aderal because it made me feel normal but thankfully I was able to stop. He was dragging me down with him and I couldn’t do it anymore. 

But he guilted me into staying friends with him for another year and would even asked me weird questions like if we would still be friends if I found a new bf, with I tell new boyfriend about him, and if I would leave the new bf if he didn’t approve of our friendship. Even if we weren’t together he was still being incredibly controlling and still wanted to be in my life. 

Even when I did start to date a new guy I met on bumble (didn’t last, dumped me after 4 months because he lost interest..) he wanted to know everything about the guy, like was he taller, cuter, how much he made and even was asked if he had a bigger dick and was better in bed (we never even had sex, he claimed he had a contagious health issue, not an std but I forgot what it was). I was in constant stress and just couldn’t take it anymore and finally blocked him on everything. He tried to reach out to me again with a new number and when I told him once again that I couldn’t do it anymore and wanted to be left alone, he went on a tangent about how he was just trying to be nice and check on me, how I needed to see a psychologist for my anger issues and negativity, how he has a new gf that treats him way better than I ever did (he lied about that and in general I learned that he was just a serial liar), and how no one will ever care about me like he did. Well, he was right about one thing, no one since has ever cared about me...

We broke up about 2 years ago and since I’ve only had sex with him... I dated a guy for 4 months and we kissed and saw each other naked but never had sex because of the reason above. Don’t know if it was true or if he just wasn’t attracted to me physically enough to even bother.. While I was in trade school I hung out with a classmate/friend that I was in class with for like a year. During that hangout I started to catch feelings and he actually invited me back to his place to watch anime. We were just sitting on his bed and slowly I was just saying that we could cuddle if he wanted and he agreed. I knew him well and knew that he was always dating/sleeping with girls so I thought that maybe he would want to be fwb (pathetic I know) and when I brought it up he seemed a little hesitant and said that he found me attractive. I didn’t say anything else and just assured him that if he wanted to it was fine. He turned to me and we started making out but when it came to do the deed he couldn’t get it up. He kept saying that it always happens the first time he is with someone and I just kept assuring him that it was totally fine. I didn’t want him to feel embarrassed so we just went back to cuddling. I know it sounds stupid but I just felt so horrible, that maybe he just couldn’t get turned on and just made something up to make me feel better.. I honestly felt like in a way I made him uncomfortable or like he felt like he had to do it to make me feel better. The next few days I apologized in a text about if I made him uncomfortable and if we could go back to hanging out as friends. He read the message but never replied. In school he would act normal but I still felt extremely uncomfortable around him and ashamed, so I just avoided him and blocked him on everything.. I just didn’t know what to do.. 

I also had a guy friend who made me cuddle with him once and it just made me feel so violated, like I didn’t have any control or say over what I wanted. It especially hurt because I thought he was one of my good friends, but the way he did it is he made it seem like it was a very normal thing for friends to do and that I was the one being the weirdo and asshole. So I just laid there on the couch for I don’t know how long just wanting it to be over. Thank god it only happened once and he never asked to do it again. 

Maybe my suicidal thoughts come from me never feeling like I have control over anything. I’m just tired of people thinking they can do what they want with me and treating me like I’m less of a human being than them, like I’m less deserving of respect. Especially as a very average-below average looking woman, I feel so invisible. I’m the most average looking woman you can imagine. Average height, weight, brown hair, brown eyes, my body is so bland and shapeless, and my boobs are barely a B cup. I don’t even feel like I have a good personality to make up for it. The only men who are ever into me are older men or creepy/controlling men. Sure I can do my best to put on a bunch of makeup, wear tighter more revealing clothing, get plastic surgery, but I feel like that would only attract worse men. 

I just wish that I could have a normal healthy mind. I wish that I could stop having these horrible thoughts about myself and truly love myself. I wish that I knew how to attract good men and maintain a healthy relationship with them. If you were to ask me to choose between a million dollars or love, I would choose love. I’m not even a picky person, sure we all have preferences that are just ingrained in us, I have mine. But again, I don’t feel like I’m asking for a lot. I’m pretty short and small, so it’s not like I’m asking for a 6ft+ greek god. Just a guy with a sweet face and a kind, genuine personality, who will treat me right. I just want someone I can feel safe and comfortable with.

But I feel that I need to fix my mindset before I consider getting involved with someone. The last thing I would want is to finally find the perfect person only to taint them with my negativity... But I’ve been trying for years and still nothing. I’ve tried therapy but that was no help at all. I just feel like at this point it’s just better for me to stay away from everyone and to just let myself rot away into the dark. I’ve lost hope and I’m just waiting for the right place and time to end it. I’ve never really liked it here in America, so I’ve even considered going somewhere in Europe, digging a hole in the ground in the woods somewhere, taking a bunch of pills, slitting my wrists, and just slowly drift away into the night. The last thing I want to see are the trees and stars.

Edit: sorry if my post is everywhere, but basically what I’m trying to say is I desperately want love but I feel like I am undeserving of it. But then on the other hand I’m also afraid of getting into a relationship because I’m afraid of being abused, abandoned, or cheated on. My parents had a bad relationship, both grandparents are divorced, and my aunt and baby cousin were murdered by her ex a couple years ago. I am still shaken by all of the things that have happened in life to the point were I have developed almost an actual fear of people, especially men. I’m constantly paranoid and feel like everyone is just out to take advantage of me and hurt me. I’m tired of living like this. I don’t want to be alone but I don’t have any other choice."
2332,depression,i don’t want to do this anymore,"this life isn’t for me. i can’t process and cope with my emotions at all. 

the love of my life left me. my best friend, my other half. i don’t want to go on without him. it hurts so much. i don’t want to do it."
2333,depression,"Based on something I'm going through, I just want to tell you,","Don't feel too disappointed or depressed that you failed or couldn't do it.... You now have the burn of failure, whose fire you could use to make Big changes in yourself... Possibly becoming even better than if you succeeded.


It's not the end of the world. Look at what you already have and focus on getting better from right now. Future You will thank you... (:"
2334,depression,help,"I’ve done a few really really horrible things in my past. Like objectively horrible. I can’t forgive myself for them, nor do I deserve forgiveness or pity. There’s no good justification for what I did. I feel like a hypocrite because people think I’m a good, sweet person, but I have these past actions that haunt me. I don’t deserve good things in life. My empathy has developed since then though, so I do truly regret what I did as a teenager. I would give everything to undo those things. I’ve gone through some minor abuse/neglect and sexual trauma and some physical health problems, so maybe that was my karma for being a horrible person before?? Maybe the world tried to balance out the wrong that I did?? Where I’m really torn is I want to commit suicide so badly because I can’t live with what I did. But I’m worried that I’d be an even worse person for doing that because my mom would be crushed. I deserve to suffer for what I did, but I also want to kill myself. Should I just call it even with the world since I went through trauma after/while causing harm and try to move on with my life and do better in the future? Is it better for me to suffer and stay around for my mom, or to just leave the world and end my suffering and make sure I never do anything bad again by being gone? Idk if making my mom so upset by committing suicide would be forgivable."
2335,depression,How do yall get by,"I have GAD, MDD and ADD and I have no escape without self medicating and currently have no meds for my depression or anything, So I really need advice on what people do to release or decompress after the day of torture, what do you guys do, or what dont you do. All I have right now is self medication, I wish I could have actual medication instead of alcohol, weed and pills but welcome to the US Mental Health Care System"
2336,depression,Can someone give me their opinion,"I’ve had depression for a while and in the past year or few years it started to get really bad. I can’t handle it. My main point my mood changes multiple times in one day now, before ide be fine or just down then have one day that I want to kill myself and hate myself and it’s so painful I dont know how to explain. Now it’s just randomly during the day, I’ll be trying to make the day better and I just change to feeling worthless and like I’m ready to leave this life. Does this happen to anyone or does this mean it’s getting better or worse or something else? I’ve been on Zoloft for almost 5 months now and am currently taking 100mg. Also I’m sorry for wording this weird I don’t know how to explain it."
2337,depression,I impulsively posted of how i wanted to hurt myself and die on my instagram fan account,"What is wrong with me???? Why does this feeling come over me and try to murder my soul? Im so maniplatived. I have nothing going from my real life so im obsessed with my social media. I kind of hoped one of my online friends would ask if im okay and its fucking disgusting how toxic and mentally unstable and fucking deranged i am. Not only is my brain fucked up, so is my life and everyone and everything around me.
I will die alone. No one will ever fall in love with me and form a connection with me because i am utterly worthless"
2338,depression,I hate how much I need people's approval,"I hate how much I care about what other people think. I can rationally deduce that it is impossible to be liked by everyone, but my brain doesn't care! There must be something wrong with me, there HAS to! It's ridiculous how much I depend on the approval of others! I hate it. Whenever someone teases me or laughs at one little thing about me, I feel compelled to defend myself so they stop thinking lesser of me or try to change that part about myself. I can't just let stuff roll off my back. I've tried so hard not to care about what other people think, but I can't! How do normal people do it!? How!? The worst part is, my whole family is completely opposite. That's why there has to be something wrong with me. Why am I like this!?"
2339,depression,"If depression is a university, I would graduate with honors.",Educating myself everyday about depression and I now believe its just in my head and my perception of success and happiness. Join the club in changing our habits of thought patterns and feelings. Peace and love to all.
2340,depression,I don't feel real anymore,"I haven't felt real in a long time. Some days I feel more real than others. Does anyone know what causes this ? I've have depersonalization ever since I could remember and as I got older and more depressed, the fog seems to become unbearable. Weed is the only thing that makes me feel real anymore. I don't want to feel like this. I used to get seasonal depression when I was a teen and how my depression is chronic. I always feel tired"
2341,depression,"Nearly everyone in this world is a cunt, and i cannot be bothered with them anymore.","Nobody is gonna bother reading this, so who cares?

And no, im not going to hurt myself, i just get fed up a lot of the time."
2342,depression,My depression is getting out of control.,"My depressions getting in the way of my relationship. It’s making my S/O mad at me. How can I control it? How can I stop being angry sad all the time for NO reason? 

I just feel like I’m at a super low point in my life, even though everything is super great at the moment. I don’t understand why this is even happening."
2343,depression,Today was truly worthy of 2020,"I truly just wanted to get in my car and drive and drive until I could escape everything in my life. I'm trying to get better, but the world just keeps knocking me back. I'm fearful for my future"
2344,depression,Mind plague- Noose obsessions. Drug lust. Pain enjoyment. Hopeless and worthless. What is the point.,My biggest fears. My darkest secrets. My dreams and goals. My addiction. My self harm. My inability to eat. What I've done. What I continue to do. The consequences. I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm truely alone. Even if people say they're here for me they still aren't. They can't be. I won't tell them. I cant tell them. The deepest things inside of me are so dark. I am going to lose my mind. If I don't get a better therapist soon it's only a matter of time before I snap. My current one is shit and she also sees my brother so I can not continue to see her. Fuck that. This is what plagues me constantly everyday. Even in my dreams it doesn't go away. There is no escape. The only escape is death. This is what is on my mind. I need to get it out or it will kill me.
2345,depression,Anyone else feel bad for being depressed?,"When I sit down and think about it, theres nothing really bad about my (16 F) life. My family is generally supportive and financially stable. I dont have many friends but that's fine since I'm not a fan of talking to people. the only thing wrong is my head. why cant I just be grateful? I dont understand and sometimes i think my feelings are just typical teenage angst. theres no reason for me to want to die but I still do. I feel so selfish."
2346,depression,I think I might hate my birthday,"So today is my birthday and I really have not been looking forward to it. Reason being is I don't really feel like I want to live right now it almost feels like I'm just not worth it. Most nights I cry myself to sleep thinking of the failure that I am at school and how small the chances are of me making it into college or even scoring a decent job. I believe everyone has a dream job but the worst part is making the realization that no matter how long you have wanted to be something it doesn't happen. I really hate my birthday because it reminds me that I have been living this life for another year. I don't exactly want to kill myself I just want to let everyone else enjoy their lifes without worrying about me. I was bullied for a long time and the people I thought were friends of mine ended up just being lies. I hate how some people say being bullied was the best thing that happened to them and that they lost alot of weight because of it. If you feel like being bullied was a good thing then you haven't been bullied. Every time I talk to someone I get scared, I start shaking and I've lost the ability to trust new people. Being bullied isn't good it really isn't. (I'm sorry If I got off topic I just had a lot of things to say and didn't quite know how to express myself. I don't know if somone else has experienced this but if you have then I am sorry. I also know a lot of people have it worse than me so I would like to tell all of you that you have put up a great fight against whatever is troubling you and I really hope things can get better for you.)"
2347,depression,I don't think I have any friends left to talk to,I find myself circling the drain. All the ones I trusted have shown some sort of bias that prevents me from opening up anymore. I feel so alone.
2348,depression,I just don’t like myself,"This is the central theme. I’m boring, awkward, fat, and not as kind as I could be. I’m also lazy and not very good at my job. I can’t seem to change and my life is more than half over."
2349,depression,No energy left at all,"I can’t maintain any of my relationships now. Even checking my notifications makes me feel exhausted. I have unread messages from the few people who reached out but I just can’t bring myself to answer them. I don’t even have a valid reason for why I’ve been ghosting them, I just feel like I’m going to pass out whenever I wanna reply to someone. Since all of my friendships are online now due to COVID, this has helped make me completely stranded. Just stuck in the house with two family members who Im slowly getting extremely tired of, even though they’ve done nothing wrong, I just can’t stand anything anymore. I don’t know what to do. I feel so trapped in a cage partially of my own creation."
2350,depression,Flawed,"I know I’m flawed and I have deep rooted issues I need to work out but I don’t know where to even begin. Some days I try to convince myself I’m all good, but inevitably the facade I tell my self falls apart and I break down. I’ve been through my cycles for too long and idk what to do. I’m just a flawed shitty excuse for a human"
2351,depression,I can't fucking do it,"This has been the hardest week in a really long time.  Intrusive thoughts are creeping in.  I've thought about killing myself every single day this week.  Ive been getting a day off from work every week for the past month for unrelated reasons and this week I thought I was going to finally make it through without taking a day off but my fucking brain won't let me.  Im calling in.  I'm exhausted, I feel like shit about myself and I'm fucking scared."
2352,depression,Depression and beyond,"I am 25 years old and unemployed. I cleared my engineering just about 2 weeks back thanks to the pandemic, after failing 4 subjects for 2 years.  
I used to drink about 2 full bottles of hard liquor a day back in 2019. I switched to smoking ganja after that. This month i abused about a 1000 pills of xanax. I have been depressed since forever.  
I was mentally and physically abused as a child until high school. I am severely depressed at this point. The xanax abuse has killed all my inhibitions. I can put a victorinox knife to my carotid without thinking twice. I have completely lost it, I am not interested in anything at all. I'm sick of media, games, shows, movies, literally everything. I tried suiciding back in 2012 by way of spraying bug spray down my throat, hoping it would condense and cause cardiac arrest because i had a technical faliure in my IB diploma high school (worst course one can opt for).   
My parents don't talk to each other and i dont talk to them. We live in the same house in different rooms, almost like a guest house to sleep in.  
I am extremely depressed and i am seriously considering taking 8-10mg of Xan and slitting my both my carotids.  
I workout...got a 2 pack etc, everyone loves me...there's no party without me. But i'm totally dead on the inside.  
Some asshole therapist suggested me to use Nexito...it had zero to none effect on my condition (my dick didnt work properly for a week or so), so that's the best result i could get.  
I have gone through a lot of spiritual revelations about life, the universe in general.  I feel we're living on a horrible planet. And i want to leave this world.   
I dont feel like eating, I don't want to meet people.And i have this major compulsion to fuck any woman i see. I have completely fried my brain. I seriously don't want to live at all  
Bottomline my life is a living hell. I have 20 bucks with me and i've been sitting at home since 9 months due to this pandemic. I have completely lost it. Suicide may not be the best option but i wont hesitate even for a second if it comes to that. I really need some honest advice."
2353,depression,Just Whining About Shit,"I'll never fix my problems. Every time I try I fail. I'm also full of shit, and yet most of the time I think I'm so smart. I'm really uneducated for my level of intelligence. I'm confused about everything and I don't know what to belief. My life won't change for the better and it's all downhill. Suicide sounds so fucking nice sometimes. Well, not nice really, just an end to pointless suffering and confusion.

Thanks for reading my useless ramble."
2354,depression,Depressed about the future,"I think I’m slowly falling into a deep depression about the future of the world. The thing that triggered it was the US elections. Seeing how many people voted for Trump after what he has done really saddened me, before that I was hopeful about how the pandemic showed how some of the idiotic world leaders (like in the US, Brazil, Mexico) were incompetent and they would be voted out. Now I think 24/7 about how many people are starving, how many animals are abandoned and suffering from industrial farms, how many people care more about partying than taking care of others in the community, how many kids are not receiving a proper education because of what’s going on and also how even though I’d love to have kids I wouldn’t do it because they wouldn’t have a future in this world (climate wise). I also feel guilt because I know I’m privileged and I don’t have to worry about what I’m going to eat or where I’m going to sleep. I just feel hopeless about everything and I don’t know how to explain that to others."
2355,depression,Im not lazy....,"I just cant hold anymore... i spent all my energy just to get up from my bed, or fake a smile while i cry all day, everyday 

So, stop to call me lazy, im doing way more than my body can hold, so just stop...."
2356,depression,I just had a mental breakdown at 12 in the morning,I’m still covered in tears.  I’m in a pit of worthlessness and anger.  I just want to be a normal person.  I don’t want this depression anymore. It seems pathetic for a 16 year old to cry their eyes out over something that isn’t real.  I’m rambling I’m sorry.
2357,depression,If I only would’ve listened to the writers of bojack horseman,"
You’re just going to get older, and harder and more alone and you’re going to do everything you can to fill that hole with friends, your career and meaningless sex, but the hole never gets filled and one day you’re going to look around and realize that everybody loves you, but nobody likes you. And that is the loneliest feeing in the world” fuck man I’m bojack horseman, I see so much of myself in him it’s sickening... I’m sick"
2358,depression,OD abuse,"For the past two months i have been abusing Xanax like there is no tomorrow. I have had severe depression since 2018. I am 25 and currently unemployed. I am losing my mind. I downed 30 mg of benzos in 1 single session last week. I have lost all inhibitions due to the Xan abuse. At this point i am majorly depresed and i wouldn't hesitate for a second  to put an ice pick to my carotid and slash it open.   
I want to know what the withdrawal symptoms will be and how am i going to feel once i stop taking this. And i also want to know how i can get over depression without these meds"
2359,depression,Feelings suck,"I simply cannot hold a stable relationship with anyone because of my nihilistic ways. No one gets it, no one understands, my mother told me I'd basically never find love and it just breaks me inside. Maybe I am destined to be alone after all. I don't know why I expect anything from anyone anymore. Whenever I meet someone new I make up a perfected version of them in my head, and then get sad when they're not how I envisioned them to be. I know this is wrong, and no matter how hard I try to tell myself that no one is 100% of what you want them to be, I always continue this cycle of meeting someone new and then ending whatever we had months after. It's all just so pointless, I don't know why I try anymore. It's just so hard to breakaway from the fantasies because you want that person so fucking much. On top of this, I have a series of mental issues such as schizophrenia that make it hard for a potential love interest to accept me for who I truly am. No one wants a project, and I'm a hard one at that. I guess I'm just a lost cause at this point. I wish all my struggles would go away so I can be normal and live a normal life. But instead I am trapped by this darkness that consumes my mind and every fibre of my being. It must be nice to love and to be loved, something which I'll never have, so I live through others in hopes to feel the fucking same."
2360,depression,I can't take this anymore,"I've been diagnosed with depression for 5 years now, had my ups and downs since there and i discovered that I've been living whith it for a long time, but I've never been so low in my state. I've been dating for four years and my gf have depression too so I never really wanted to put weight on her because of me and always help her and thank God I could do that, now she's a better person that can laugh and enjoy a lot of things. 
On the other hand, even trying so hard to never put this weight on her i had a serious breakdown that I've never had in front of her, and she reacted saying good things for me on the moment, but since then she stopped being the same until today...she simply exploded whith me saying that I am doing this on purpose and trying to get people to be pity about me and that she can't take this because I'm a burden and she don't owes me anything. I agree with her, she don't but she was the last person I had that I could trust and ask for some help and now for her it looks like that im better dead than anything and I just can't keep holding up...she was my last fortress and the one I had to count on this times but after the horrible things she said I just can't...I'm weak and have no one anymore...I'm tired from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to sleep and even hurt myself and I gotta say that even with this direct contact I can fell anything anymore. I just wanna go you know, I have literally nothing left and I'm tired of just being a burden to everyone 
Sorry to take your time if you read through, really"
2361,depression,It’s not really fair that people force you to live..,"I didn’t ask to be born and I didn’t ask for this sh!t life so why is it fair that people (the government, hospitals, police officers, even family and friends) force you to keep living when it’s literally torture every single day. Every time I’ve ever contemplated.. I’ve stopped myself and realized how bad it would hurt my family but then I get angry because why do they want me to suffer? Why don’t they want me to be at peace? When old or chronically ill people die everyone says, “well at least they are no longer suffering.” Why not want that for me?"
2362,depression,I got told I wasn’t sick and was honestly a little disappointed,"A while back I had covid and had to be hospitalized which included lots of blood work. After being discharged I got a call that some things in my blood work looked off and I’d have to see a doctor at their cancer center.
I feel so guilty that I felt some relief (?) I pretty much instantly accepted the fact I may have had cancer and was ready to die.


So the day comes and I go to my appointment. They also handle blood disorders in the cancer center apparently. So the doctor basically just told me I was called in to them because something in my blood suggested a predisposition to clotting and was possibly (though not likely) genetic. Wow. 


I left the appointment a little disappointed and I know that makes me a horrible person. My dad was relieved, I’m sure because he didn’t want to deal with the cost of cancer treatments, and I know he loves me but his love has limits. For example, he doesn’t love me enough to take me seriously when I say I’m depressed, anxious, suicidal and need help. 


I know I’m technically a “grown woman” I’m an adult but I’m on his insurance plan and I’m not too keen on giving up good insurance just to be independent when I have other chronic physical health conditions. I can already barely take care of myself. I don’t make enough to even pay a therapist on a sliding scale and the last time I went to one who said she was willing to go pro bono she dropped me in two sessions. Apparently she could already tell I’d be too stubborn/ a waste of time and too difficult. Little did she know that was the first time I had actually stayed committed to my meds (6 months, never skipped a dose) and didn’t cancel/rescheduled a million times. I had been proud of myself for once; I was so excited to tell her how proud I was and I didn’t even get to tell her before it all just fell apart so quick.


I’ve been in a dark place the past few weeks but especially today and idk what to do. I’m just exhausted and really guilty that for a while I had been hoping to get diagnosed with a terminal illness."
2363,depression,OD abuse," For the past two months i have been abusing Xanax like there is no tomorrow. I have had severe depression since 2018. I am 25 and currently unemployed. I am losing my mind. I downed 30 mg of benzos in 1 single session last week. I have lost all inhibitions due to the Xan abuse. At this point i am majorly depresed and i wouldn't hesitate for a second to put an ice pick to my carotid and slash it open.  
I want to know what the withdrawal symptoms will be and how am i going to feel once i stop taking this. And i also want to know how i can get over depression without these meds"
2364,depression,Life always has a twist,"Whenever something is going my way, just when I start to think wow things aren’t so bad, life fucks me. It’s just a cycle of ups and downs. I’m afraid to get excited about things anymore or get my hopes up because I just expect to be let down. I guess this is the way life naturally progresses. I feel like I’m consistently doing what I need to do to be moving in the right direction but it feels like it doesn’t matter. Shit just keeps getting worse. I feel like total shit today but I know I’ll feel ok tomorrow and maybe even good the next day. But then the cycles repeats and I feel like shit. I’m just trying to keep moving in the right direction but it just feels unrewarding and pointless."
2365,depression,I've been feeling so fucking bad today. I felt like throwing up earlier.,"I've calmed down a little bit but I still feel like crap. I keep having suicidal thoughts.

For the first time in my life, I am alone. I have no friends anymore. I still at 19 haven't had a girlfriend. The last friend I had started icing me.

I don't really know what to do. I try my best to be happy and supportive online but I've been pretty snarky lately because I'm giving up. I just don't have any energy left.

I don't want to be alone yet I force myself to be alone by being too fucking afraid to find a job or get out more.

I haven't dated because I'm too fucking scared of nothing. I've had chances, never took them.

I know I'm obviously a decent looking person as I've had decent looking girls be interested in me but I just can't let people into my heart, it's too fucking scary. I don't want to be called over emotional because my emotion is all I have. I am nothing but an emotional wreck half the time, and I'm starting to fall apart at the seams.

People don't notice but I'm not okay. I've tried to push through my depression, understand it, accept it for what it is... I can't do it.

I just feel like I don't have the energy to better my life, yet I need to better my life to find the energy I need.

I feel really alone for the first time in my life. I feel truly afraid for the first time in my life.

All I can think of is, ""I wanna go home"" even though I'm in my own house. This place doesn't feel like home anymore it feels almost like a prison. I have no one to talk to but family and reddit.

I don't know what to do."

2368,depression,Serious self hate,"I don’t know what can I do anymore. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve had negative thoughts about my body. I don’t think I’ve ever completely loved it. I’m 20 years old now and I can’t stop thinking about how I’m not pretty enough, not thin enough, not curvy enough, about how my waist is not small enough, how my boobs are not big enough, how my skin is not smooth enough, my eyes not big enough, etc. I just can never look in the mirror and feel happy and relaxed. Sometimes, like right now, I feel the need to hurt me, to punish my body for not being good enough (yes I’m talking about self cutting) I feel like I really need other’s approval, specially approval from the opposite sex. I could never admit this to my friends or relatives since I feel pathetic for even having those thoughts. My own embarrassment doesn’t even let me seek for help, but I don’t want to live anymore. I’m tired of hating myself so much, it consumes me. I just can’t see a way out. It doesn’t matter how many times people tell me I’m pretty, I just can’t see it and never will. 

PD: I’m a female college student (English is obviously not my first language)"
2369,depression,Completely pathetic,"I feel like a complete failure

In no where in my life have I succeeded at anything. I’m always just sub par. I have absolutely zero friends, never get invited out, no girls. Sometimes I’ll meet someone and we always hit it off at first, but they always end up ghosting or just realizing I’m not that great.

I’ve always considered myself to be intelligent, but even now I have so many doubts. I’m really not that intelligent, I don’t read, and I work at smiths (a dead end retail job.

I think the worst part is the inability to talk to my parents and the few friends I have. I just can’t figure out what to say to them, and I feel like I hold everything in because I don’t want to scare them about the dark shit I think about. I’m so depressed and it’s hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel.
My memory is shit. It feels like time is just flying by, and I’m running out of it. But I’m only 24. Idk it’s fucked.

I want to be a software engineer. I hear about ageism in tech, now i dont know what to do with myself.

I dont think i can even have a normal career now. I shop up as an intern at 40...would they even accept me? I dont know what to do. My life is over.

2378,depression,Whats the next step?,"Hey guys

Ive been feeling lost for a while now. Like I'm just coasting, just waiting for the day to be done. Im 20 years old, thirs year of college, and I have no idea who I am anymore. Back in high school i was pushed to be great. Everyone vouched for me, I had to be great at school, I had to be a great role model, i had to go to university to become a teacher... Now I don't even want to finish school. Ive been going through some shit. I got big body issues. I lost one of my bestfriends recently and I don't know why. I think i have an eating disorder. I don't feel happy. The only time I feel happy is when I get high. It comes to a point where Im always high. 

I had an appointment with my family doctor and i got a referal for a psychologist. Im on a waitlist right now, but it could be months. I feel suicidal most of my day. its not like I would end my life, but these thoughts are always present and it makes it hard to enjoy little things when you hate your body and brain. 

All i want to do right now is drugs. Is that bad to say? Ive tripped a couple times and I smoke weed all the time, but sometimes its just not enough. I know that i shouldnt fuck with strong shit. Ive seen people on hard drugs and Im scared of them. But at the same time, it would be nice to not worry about shit.

I act like Im fine, but im dying inside. I keep my head up for my friends, because ive always been like that. My friend circle got fucked with when one of my bestfriends blocked me a couple weeks ago. I try to be over it yknow, but all the memories keep flooding my mind and all the promises, all the ""we in the forever"" or the ""youre important to me"" haunt me right now. My other friends keep saying he's gonna come around. Honestly I don't think so because of his ego. I wish he could come back because I love him and care so much about him, but how am I supposed to trust him again? How am I supposed to put all this pain behind and act like it never existed? I wish someone could talk to him, like call him out for his behaviour because everyone knows he's not doing okay but no one is helping. I want to help, but Im the only person who cant. I wish someone could tell him to wake the fuck up. I dont care if he doesnt want to be friends anymore, i just want to know why. To get some closure? To see if its me who's broken? I don't know. All i know is that it hurts.

Im lonely. I feel so lonely, yet i hang out with friends everyday. I think im not ready for love. I think that i might not meant to be loved. 

So whats the next step? How do I get out of this hell? Knowing that I dont want to stop doing drugs, I cant leave school because im already 30k$ in debt. What do I do to become happy again?

thanks."
2379,depression,"I’ve been suicidal since I’m 11. I’m 18 now, and I feel like I have actually tried everything. I’m not afraid anymore.","I wrote and planned my first suicide when I was 11. I was sexually assaulted when I was 12. I had a string of toxic and abusive boyfriends until I was 17. Bullied by everyone and subsequently was made everyone’s worst enemy in high school. My parents love me to death, but I know for a fact I’m a burden. Accomplished everything I was supposed to do in high school in order to make me me happy—valedictorian, president of everything, multiple merit based scholarships, multiple team captains—and still attempted twice because of course nothing attainable would make someone genuinely happy. Had a spiritual awakening. Grew a lot and learned to reprogram my subconscious. Broke out of the metaphorical matrix. Had a hope for a little bit, but I am done. Death doesn’t scare me anymore, especially with the philosophy of life that I have now with spirituality, philosophy, and omnism. The only thing that has kept me here is guilt for the subsequent pain I would pass along to my friends and family. My mother and boyfriend especially. My boyfriend loves me the most in the entire world, and I’m so unbelievably lucky, but I’ve been in pain for a long time. I’ve lost 2 people I’ve cared about to suicide and I’ve seen all the people they were close to recover. I know it will hurt my loved ones for a while, but I know they’ll get better especially with each other. I’ve been so intensely suicidal for so long that my friends don’t even get alarmed when I self harm or cry about it anymore. It’s that normalized. They expect it of me. I understand how exhausting it is to be so present for someone like that so of course I don’t mind. I think I am including to add emphasis on how severely suicidal I’ve been. I go to therapy and that helped. I do a lot of CBT and shadow work to improve my mental health, and im very self aware regarding psychology and my ego, but now it’s just awareness because my circumstances are too strenuous to allow me to employ and practice what I know. Been stretched thin for a long time. 

I want to pass around my birthday. It’s February 13th so it’s after the holiday season. That way, my death won’t be associated with the holidays. I’m Vietnamese so I’m concerned about Lunar New Year and valentines but that’s all. I’ve been saving money for a long time because I have generalized anxiety with an emphasis on money and disasters, so I have a lot saved for my funeral. I don’t think it makes me sad, like planning this, or the fact that I have a plan in general. This is so privileged and redundant and annoying, so I’m sorry. I think I just needed an outlet because I don’t want to burden my friends and my boyfriend anymore. At least here people have the option to scroll past, which I respect and somewhat endorse(?) Because I think my mind is made. 

I think I’m going to take things with work and school down a notch so I have the room to indulge in a few things I’ve always wanted to do before I die. Going to check back into real life now because I have finals :/ Sending love to anyone else who needs it."
2380,depression,What's next,"Ibe just finished a 3 year relationship with the women i thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I was a social recluse before with a suicidal mindset and had a dedicated plan to end my life as I am sick to death of the place and I hate it. Throughout those 3 years I gained a different point of view and decided to stay around as I was happy and realised the damage I would cause my relatives if I did something like that.

My question is hiw do I stop slipping into the mindset that I was in before I met my ex. Has anyone on here experienced anything similar and what did you do if you have.

I'm just scared of being sad for the rest of my life I don't want to be like this it's pissing me off. I can't find any hobbies or any other reason to be here other than not wanting to hurt my family. I'm fed up and sick of it all"

2382,depression,Girlfriend with depression,"Hey all, I'm here trying to learn a bit more about how depression affects people. For context, my girlfriend has depression. We've been dating for almost a year. It's been really, really hard. We did about three months long distance, but pretty much all of it feels like long distance because of the pandemic. She lives with her parents who are both 65+ so she was reluctant to hang out with me indoors from march til we went LD in the summer. I thought when we got back it would be better; I was moving into a new place so I could isolate myself more completely, but the renovation went until about a month ago. Then we had our first spat and she's been super depressed since.

I knew she had depression but this is the worst ive seen it affect her. I'm trying to be supportive because I know it isn't anything she's doing on purpose, but I just don't fully understand how ot affects her. We haven't been talking much, just a few banal texts every few days. I want to more completely understand how she feels but she says she just doesn't have the energy for such an emotional conversation right now. I haven't seen her in like two months and have barely spoken to her for one and miss her like crazy. I'm just hoping there's someone here who can tell me a little bit more about what you feel like and what's going through your head when you can't get out of bed and can barely talk to the people you love.

I've been doing a pretty good job taking care of myself through this. I still eat as much as I should and have been talking to a counselor myself which has helped. I'm really just here to try and hear from some folks who have been through it. Anyone who has a depressed partner and wants to talk about it is welcome as well. Thanks all."

2384,depression,"Feeling ugly, unwanted, and generally like garbage","Like the title says, I’m 20M and am dealing with a probably less than average face in terms of looks, and hair that refuses to work ever, I should also add that I have developed a noticeable bald spot that I’m going to have to pay to get fixed. I never got compliments on my appearance or told that I was attractive by anyone except family who obviously are only going to say that because they’re family, and at this point I just ignore their comments about being handsome because I don’t even believe them anymore, I think they’re just trying to make me feel better. 

After a terrible relationship with a girl that ended almost 2 years ago, I haven’t been out with any girls and have only actually been seriously interested in one, only one girl in that whole time that I’ve been actually interested in. I work with her, and while we have so much in common, including morals and dating “rules”, and have had managers make comments like “You’d be a really cute couple” and the like, I know that deep down she doesn’t feel the same and it kills me. I feel like the only thing stopping her from wanting me is that I’m ugly and that’s not something I can fix. 

I’m frustrated because I’m very smart and talented and the people close to me know this, but no amount of intelligence or musical ability is going to make someone say “He’s cute.”,  only looks will. I feel like if someone just took the time to get to know me they would look past my physical imperfections. 

Which leads me to my next point, if someone who I feel is so right for me doesn’t want me, how am I even going to attract anyone else, right or wrong? I feel like I was born to suffer in this life and just watch everyone else be happy and do the things I want to do but am always prevented from by circumstances beyond my control.

Failing all of my courses, can’t seem to pass my real estate test because my memory deteriorated. Therapist and meds didn’t work. When I get myself in the mindset that everything’s ok, something new happens. I don’t care for life anymore at all. My mind can’t do this. I physically can’t do this. One thing after the other. I’m tired of always having something new health scare wise to bring to my parents. I’m tired of going to emergency rooms. I’m tired of my friends never reaching out.

Fine I get over it.. then a week later I’m driving on the highway (it was dark and foggy) I took a sip of my drink and it spilled all over me, then I took another sip a few miles down and as I took a sip a dead deer was in the dead middle of the highway and I ran over it and the car basically jumped.. then I had court today and my fiancé took off of work to take me, just to find out right before we get there that it got postponed until Thursday, so now my fiancé has to take off again.. so now my fiancé is aggravated at me because my lawyer knew and didn’t tell me so I should have texted him last night... then we went to see his dad and I was driving, I swear the light was green, and it was red.. I Tboned a car and though No one was hurt and our car was okay(some damage to bumper), the guy we hits’ car wasn’t drivable because his tire got messed up.. Instead of calling the police we gave the guy our last 200$ that was supposed to be used towards bills.. So now my fiancé is even more mad at me because I got into an accident.. so I just feel like nothing can ever go right for me. There’s so much other bad stuff that’s happened to me this year but I’ll be sitting here all day talking about it. I have no friends to talk to, I don’t really like talking to my family about my personal life and how I’m feeling, and my fiancé is mad at me so I don’t want to talk to him. I feel just unloved and like I can’t do anything right. I just hate my life honestly.. I’m just numb to everything at this point and I can’t take it anymore... I don’t know what to do or who to talk to😪"

2401,depression,Im starting to go insane,"I dont now what to say here,im losing my emotions and feelings i feel nothing but sadness and hatred,i still have feelings for my family but anyone else especially students from my middle school i have deep hatred on almost everyone i knew"
2402,depression,(F17) I don’t believe anything can help me anymore,"Sorry if this is a mess it’s my first reddit post and I just made this account because I needed to vent.

I basically had relatively normal mental health with a bit of anxiety until I was about 11, it’s like my anxiety and depression suddenly started spiralling out of control and I stopped going to school  (My hair was literally falling out from stress) and because of this I’ve never had any chance to make friends outside of my family, for the past 4-5 years all I’ve been doing is sitting in my bedroom with my door closed and my curtains pulled wasting my life when I should be out doing things, my skin is literally the colour of paper because i haven’t had any sunlight for years and my anxiety is so bad I have extreme trouble even leaving my room even to get a glass of water or to go to the bathroom which is right down the hall.


My depression progressively got worse and worse from this and now I feel like it’s the worst I’ve ever been in my life I’ve suddenly developed extreme paranoia and distrust in pretty much everyone around me, I’ve got no friends no goals and no hobbies, all I do is sit in my room and go on my phone all day trying to distract myself from anything productive that I should be doing going to sleep at 4am waking up at 12pm and repeating the same cycle, I basically have no education from all my problems with school and I have a really hard time trying to care about it at all, I’ve had more therapists and psychiatrists that I can count and tried so many different medications and it’s like nothing works because I’m so stubborn and pessimistic, my anxiety had gotten to the point where I’m stuck in my room all day doing the same thing thinking everybody knows everything about me and if I force myself to get outside I instantly want to go home because I imagine everyone looking at me and laughing at me.

I feel like I’m wasting my entire life and all I can do is just watch myself, I feel like I’m existing instead of living I can’t even remember how it feels to be genuinely happy and stress free it’s like every time I try to get better a new problem comes along, i always think that I’ll never be normal and have a normal life, I feel like a can relate to nobody because everyone I see with the same problems as me has at least a few friends but I have none and I don’t even know how to make them, I cant even talk to people online because it makes me so uncomfortable.

I feel like nothing I do is ever good enough and I feel like I’m the laziest person ever because I always have to fuck it all up for myself somehow , it’s like my brain refuses to do anything healthy and it’s just constantly on self sabotage mode, even trying to write about it like I’m doing right now just makes me roll my eyes at myself and want to just delete the whole thing because of how stupid I sound."
2403,depression,Living feels like...,"Living feels like an unfair race. Like someone is telling you, ""ok, all you need to do is take 10 steps from A to B, you're almost there"" and everyone around you is running to the finish line but you have 50kg weights on your legs. I guess the only consolation is that you're not the only one running with this handicap."

I’ve been feeling like this for just over 2 months."
2406,depression,2020 has been the worst year for me..,"I've dealt with depression since I was 9 and have never been this depressed. Started in March when I was laid off due to covid. In April I found out my 5 year old son has a brain tumor. In May I was in the hospital for surgery and recovery for him. June - August we had radiation 5 times a week, 2 hours away from home. Ever since I got his diagnosis I have been extremely depressed. Usually my depression will come and go, but this has been a constant sadness I can't shake. I feel so hopeless. My relationship is so fragile right now, although I love my sons dad I dont have the energy to fight for this anymore. I'm failing at being a mother and wife. I work as a server and I'm ashamed everyday going to work because of how a lot of people talk and treat us waitresses. My job is very stressful and the managers just don't care. I'm burnt out after 5 years there, but I apply everywhere I can and never get a call back. I have 1 friend who I don't talk to often, and it's hard to make friends when I get so anxious around big groups and strangers. I could go on and on but who really cares? I feel like I am in a downward spiral fast. I can't imagine many more months of living with the sadness and pain.
Sorry if my thoughts seem all over the place. It's been a rough night ."
2407,depression,For what?,"Not for nothing, but these results have me feeling hopeless and angry. It’s like the light at the end of the tunnel is fading. And since there’s so little light in the tunnel already, as I’m constitutionally incapable of sustained joy, I don’t know how to continue — much less why."
2408,depression,This election is freaking me out...,"I don’t like to bring up politics on social media, but this election is so scary. I am a member of the LGBTQ community and Trump is pushing to get rid of same-sex marriage. I am also a woman and would like a president that doesn’t pridefully say he grabs women by the pussy.

I’m afraid I’m going to lose my rights. I’m afraid I’m going to be attacked by Trump supporters (I have a Biden sign in front of my house). I’m afraid that abortion will become illegal nationally. I’m afraid that I’ll lose my life to COVID because of Trump’s negligence. Oh yeah, forgot to mention that I have a lung disorder (really hard to explain so I won’t) that puts me at a high risk of life threatening complications. My sister said that the person at the polling location she went to said “if you aren’t voting for Trump then you have to select libertarian.” My sister voted straight libertarian because of an election judge fucking with the election. I am so scared.

All I’m asking for is a little decency and humanity from the world but I can’t get that. I’m not a Democrat and I’m CERTAINLY not a Republican. Personally, I don’t even think people that are support Trump are Republicans. They have created their own political party full of hatred.

If anyone replies to this and tries to start an argument I’m not going to reply. I’m fearing for my life and I have every right to."

2411,depression,I’ve fucked my life and I’m only 16.,I’ve absolutely tanked my education. I don’t have any irl friends and I have a single online friend I still talk to. I don’t have very good social skills. I’m not smart. I don’t know any trades. I don’t have a job. I don’t know what gender I identify as but I do know I don’t like my current appearance. I don’t have much money saved. And I believe I have clinical depression even though I don’t have an official diagnosis. All I think about everyday is ending my life but I’m too weak to do so. I wish I could be better. I wish I had the energy to actually get off my ass and do something. I wish I didn’t have to live anymore.
2412,depression,Oh my,Why can't life be more simple and happy. instead we realized the ugly reality that life is not that precious and beautiful. We face everday problems i mean the world is so mess up. And now a days peope are so addicted to this social media
2413,depression,I feel so damn restless..,I have some stuff to do but I am not doing it. I know I have to do it but idk I just get super anxious. I feel my energy being drained and I just pace around my room like a lunatic or I just sleep for hours on end or skip meals. I literally can't control myself anymore. It's just so frustrating. Life is no longer meaningful for me....
2414,depression,I hate who I am,"I have binge eating disorder, depression, anxiety, and many other sub-mental illnesses and by far my BED is what causes most of my other symptoms. It’s so out of control that I’ve ballooned to 340lbs. I absolutely am disgusted by myself and feel like an alien when I’m around others. I see them staring at me, I know they’re thinking about how I look, I know people in my life judge me and are embarrassed to be around me. None of this is even conspiracy, my father had literally told me he’s embarrassed to be seen with me. My husband and I rarely have sex anymore and when we do I dread it because I feel repulsive and like he’s only doing it because he has to. I can’t do normal people things like ride a plane, sit in a booth, go on rides, sit in movie theater seats and it genuinely makes me want to not exist. Not die necessarily because I’m absolutely terrified of death, but more like live completely alone. I can do whatever I want, eat whatever I want, and be whoever I want and never have a soul judge me. My agoraphobia has returned to the point where I spend weeks at a time in my house barely leaving even to go through fast food places or get gas. I lay and sleep on the couch all day since I work from home currently. I sleep nearly 12-16 hours a day. I hate who I am."

I may just have cuts, I may have no blood going to my brain, but we'll see what happens."
2417,depression,Politicsand the state of the u.s. has me suicidal,"I know some people might say that I'm ""sounding like a fucking snowflake(tm)"" but this election has me suicidal. Mine, my loved ones', and a shitload of other people's basic human rights are in jeopardy. I think I should be allowed to feel anxious and angry.

 I have no clue what the fuck I'm going to do if worse comes to worse. With the situation im in currently, I can't leave the country. I feel like my only option is death. I know it probably isn't, but that's what it feels like. I hate what this country has become (or what is always has been under the surface ).  

Even if my own slightly better outcome happened, things are still going to be awful. Things are not getting better and I just want to escape all of it. I want to end things. My mental health has been poor for a long time, but now I'm just completely broken."
2418,depression,It’s the same thing every single day,"i fucking hate school

I’ve been going to school every other day since COVID started and it’s just been making my life miserable. Every day i feel like I just ran a marathon after getting to school I’m so exhausted. I’m literally failing most of my classes, when last year I got almost all 80s and 90s. Even when I want to get my work done, I have no motivation to do it, and when I do get motivation to do it, I can’t focus on it and get distracted within a minute. On top of that I’m working part time and taking piano lessons. It’s just miserable doing the same thing every. single. day. I feel miserable all day every day to the point where I almost started crying in the middle of class. I just feel miserable every single second of the day and it’s just tiring. Nobody even cares about it and just thinks I’m lazy without realizing how much I actually want to do something useful with my life. At this point I’ve been telling myself school doesn’t even matter at this point if I’ll be working minimum wage my whole life because I just don’t even want to bother doing anything with my life other than existing. This shit sucks"
2419,depression,My take on darkness. Maybe this will help some of you see the full side of the glass,"About darkness. What can I say except that I like it. There was a time when I was a kid and I didn't. Like most kids I would imagine that there are monsters hiding in the dark and oh boy it was a race from the bathroom to my bedroom at night after turning the bathroom lights off. 

That being said, I think that my fondness of darkness began one evening when I was with my mom (and some other people that I don't remember) and we went out at night to have a walk. I still see it clearly in my head, we were walking on the busiest street from my hometown, during the day that is, and I was just in awe; there wasn't a soul on that street except us and it gave me a feeling of peacefulness that I had never experienced before. Amazing.

After that night I was in love with it! Of course what I liked best about it was the lack of other people. I never liked the people in my hometown very much; there was not much diversity when it came to people there, I felt that most of them were stupid and superficial and the ones that were not, didn't stick for long or were just good at hiding. It also didn't help that it was not a big town at all, everyone knew everyone and to top it off, my mom was a postwoman which meant most of them knew her and subsequently me as well. I just couldn't move a finger without people gossiping, because that's what people that are stupid and superficial mostly do; I can't really blame them, what can you do when you have a narrowed thinking? Talk about other people as a form of entertaining. And what do you need most in a small town? A form of entertaining, right?

Anyway, like I said, I was in love with darkness and growing up it became more and more accessible; after all, you can't really go out at 2 AM when you are a kid, but when you become a teenager things start to change which brings me to my teenage years. I had a mildly fucked up childhood so I started doing what most people with fucked up childhoods do, experiment with substances. At first it was just drinking, another thing that I fell in love with. I mean, how could a child that had quite a few inhibitions not like getting drunk a.k.a. getting rid of those inhibitions. I started drinking with one close friend every Friday and by the time I graduated highschool it was a habit along with smoking weed. Now, you may wonder what does this have to do with darkness. Well, it all happened at night, mostly. Only then I could avoid all those thirsty for gossip eyes and ears. One more reason to like it. Not to mention that when morning came after a night of drinking and smoking weed, an overwhelming feeling always crept over me (and my friends for that matter) that the evening was over, it was time for everyone to go home and sleep. That made me hate mornings so much and it still happens to this day, 4 years after highschool. Fate would have it that I am writing this as a way to cope with one of those mornings; it's 7:50 AM and the light announced the end of a beautiful night. Too bad that I can't sleep.

Soon after high school I found another kind of darkness. This time it was not in the literal sense, this time it was a darkness of the mind. You know, sadness, anger, alienation, rejection, insecurities, fear et cetera, all the makings of good art and suicide thoughts (too bad I only experienced the latter). At first I didn't like this darkness, who would? For about two years, as this darkness grew, it crippled me more and more. Then I slowly began getting used to it, it still was this monster that followed me everywhere, but when something is constant, you just get used to it eventually, it becomes a part of you. And as I got used to it, I started seeing the other monsters out there, some bigger than mine, some smaller; it felt good knowing I'm not the only one. Soon after that, I also noticed the beauty that these monsters can create, you could say that I started to seeing the full side of the glass, not just the empty one. The thing that I am talking about is, as I mentioned earlier, art. There's a few things that I firmly believe in this life and one of them is that really good art can only come from darkness. So yeah, now I am kind of in love with this darkness too, although there are moments when the monster finds new tricks to play on me making me hate it again, the love still comes back. I just hope its imagination has limits and someday there are no more new tricks."

2421,depression,My goals when happy are too unrealistic and I don't know how to make them work,"But when depressed I have goals and they're a lot more realistic, I naturally plan out how i'm going to make them work, so does depression occur naturally when you see no way of achieving your goals?"
2422,depression,My friend keeps saying depression sounds relaxing no matter how much I try to explain,One of my friends just does not understand. I’ve told him that my depression has made me lose interest in things but that I feel bored lying around doing nothing all day. He tells me every day oh you must be having fun just relaxing. It is frustrating like he thinks I’m lying about struggling. How can I explain this in a way he will understand?
2423,depression,Getting depressed about small things is really frustrating,"I'm desperate for a pet that I can hold and snuggle. I'm married and almost 30 yet I feel like a 12 year old trying to prove to my parent that I'm responsible enough to have a pet. 

I cant get my spouse on board and it's seriously getting me down. I'm mad at myself for not being able to let it go an move on, which depresses me even more. It all feels so major even though it's pretty insignificant in the big picture."
2424,depression,I can’t stop crying. I was on my bed sleeping and then some memories came up and since then it’s been an hour of crying lol.,"Ugh. I won’t go into details - just typical my life is crap and shattered dreams. Wish me luck into the night. Lol. I turned off my TV. I’ll find out who is the President tomorrow morning.

I have a job interview tomorrow too. I’m not sure if that job is the right step for me either. 

Who wants to cry with me? haha..."
2425,depression,Isn't everything just so boring?,"I seem to lack interest in anything. I'm not as badly depressed as I used to be. I feel functional. Everything feels boring and pointless though. Sometimes I think of a job or something id like to do. I spend days looking into it. Then I just forget about it because I'm bored. Why would I want to invest in a future if ill always be bored. Everything I try to do makes me bored and in turn makes me sad. I just do things to get to the next day. I'm not looking forward to the next day, I would just like to sleep so that I dont feel bored."
2426,depression,A very shortened version why I rather wake up dead tomorrow,"idk if I can even form in words how much I hate my life. How much I go to bed not wanting to wake up in the morning, that's the dream right there, you die by something that isn't even your fault. You do nothing everyday but yet you still fall behind in school ruining the future if you did stay alive to get, and wanting to die at every given moment. I once had to stop myself from going downstairs because I had the urge to jump down the stairs but it wasn't because I wanted to stop myself from dying, it was because I know there was a likely chance I wouldnt die. You watch in a front row seat everything you once love slowly becoming terrible in your mind. How mostly everyone leaves you and the people that stay are doing it out of sympathy, effectively changing the entire friendship dynamic. You also watch as your room gets messy beyond belief because you dont have any motivation to clean it because you dont have motivation to live the next day. How you constantly have to put on a fake smile to try and trick your mind as if you're ok for just long enough to get through each task you are forced to go in. How you know nothing can make you happy and feel even more hopeless. But you feel and see all that constantly as you remind yourself taking the easy way out to end it all would traumatize people and it would be your fault, and only your fault"
2427,depression,Thoughts on medication(personal),"I don't like medication.

When I discovered that I had depression and anxiety all sort of stuff,I really wanted to fight it myself.

Medication?A way of tricking my mind, pathetic.

And after years,I had changed a lot,

I felt worst day after day,so as my health. Then desperate, suicidal.

This is an abyss.

Until...I don't remember,
I get myself into dark humour,
drive myself into another way rather than just being positive.
Finally,I developed my own thought pattern (sort of),
I see myself a tiny creature, competing for live.
This is REALITY,and people including me can die for real.
I need to be better than others to stay here.

I used my survival instinct—fight to help myself.

I thought I am on the right track,
but again another instinct emerged—flight.

I can't stop backing up.

Even worse,with a 'negative' signal from my brain and a slight panic attack,I relapsed, reset all my progress I made on being 'normal'.

I tried to manage it and minimize the effects it brings me.  However,when I reached a certain spot,I got stuck.

I can feel the limit my genes set up,as if as I try to trespass it,my nerves would be triggered and send me back to the place I was before.

Medication, maybe a solution to this,I can tell it can help me.

Although before I am an adult,I don't have access to it.

Guess I need to keep suffering for a while *chuckles*"

I fail at almost everything that I do, I failed school because I was too much of a piece of shit dumb cunt to progress any further, I can’t seem to talk to people without sounding like a fucking moron. I struggle to talk to people socially and I hate going out into public. All I want to do is just curl up and die somewhere. I’ve attempted suicide a few times and failed at that as well.

I squandered my entire social life as a child and teenager by being so fucking weird and sometimes creepy that I eventually I had to leave school and get homeschooled when I was 13. I got bullied a lot.

Theres 2 years till I leave my house and theres a million things I wish I'd done or got to do but I feel like I squandered any opportunity to make any friends, learn any hobbies that I wish I had, or just generally not be a social recluse with no social skills or academic skills.

I wish I could redo all of this and redo this pathetic attempt at life.

I wish I was born into better circumstances and a better area. I constantly fantasize about how my life would be better if I had been born elsewhere or how it would be better if I just was a better person for most of it.

2438,depression,My life is over,"\- I have been this way for most my entire life. I have had parents who are racist and bigoted and rather believe someone else over me. 

\- I work in a crummy job that people don't listen to me at all.

\- I have no friends or people my age or anyone to listen to me. I also live in a crummy town that has absolutely nothing.

\- No matter what I say or do, nobody cares to listen to me. Plus, I am jealous of people who have good things happen to them and even though when I work for it, it is never good enough for anyone.

\- I feel like sometimes I wish I was never born and everyone would be happy about it. All I am is a burden and a waste of space in life. 

\- Nobody wants to me at all what is going on with me. All they say is 'I know' or 'I understand' or 'Here's a number' without really hearing me.

2448,depression,I dunno,"i’m currently laying on my bedroom floor, unable to get the energy to take the three steps to my bed and fall asleep. I have to wake up in 3 hours. oh well, I never sleep nowadays. I used to be able to escape life in my sleep, but now all of my dreams just examine my life in greater detail, leaving me even lower than the night before.

I’m an 18 year old guy from utah, currently attending college. i’m a perfectionist, and have always done pretty well academically, but have no energy to act on the impulses. for example, at the start of the year I was taking more credit hours than necessary for full time, but I had to drop classes because I couldn’t focus in class, let alone even find the motivation to attend. lose-lose situation. either i hate myself for failing a class, or i hate myself for dropping a class. hooray. everything is online, so I have no social interaction. my few “friends” from high school have completely disappeared and stopped responding to me. I currently have no friends. 0. no irl friends, no internet friends, not even any imaginary friends—those just make me long for something real now.

i’ve been depressed for over 5 years now, each month getting lower and lower. last summer I did an experiment to see how many people would text me first. I spent a month not initiating any text conversation. I received 1 text. and they were asking for a favor. I have had suicidal thoughts (and plans) for years, and I actually acted on one a few months ago. unfortunately my parents found me. but that’s a long, unnecessary story. if i’m being honest the reason i’m here tonight is because I have the urge to act on it again. I just hate everything about myself. I hate how I look, what my voice sounds like, how my life is playing out. everything. i’ve been on various medications for months, and i’ve been in and out of therapy. nothing helps.

my girlfriend broke up with me a month or so ago because I wasn’t religious enough. no joke. everything else was great. we were happy and fit together great, I though that maybe my life was turning around. then she surprised me one day and ended it because I wasn’t as religious as her. she knew this from the start. I never asked her to give up her values or activities. I never asked her to choose me over religion. all I asked her was to love me for who I am. guess that’s just too hard. I did everything I could to make her happy. I made every compromise because she “couldnt.” everything. I guess i’m just not enough. i’m not enough for anyone. anything. i’m just a total failure. I like to think that i’m not rude or selfish or egotistical or inconsiderate or anything like that. I do my best to never judge people. I accept everyone around me. i’m always willing to help others and give up everything if it means that i’m able to make someone else happy. I see people I know and have given everything to help in the past getting married and having interesting lives, I just feel left out and like a failure.

two years ago I had another relationship with a girl. I knew she was way out of my league, but we had always been relatively close, so I didn’t think twice about it. long story short, she ended up using me to pay for everything and drive her everywhere. she cheated on me twice. that was a great time.

I just don’t understand what i’m doing wrong. I don’t understand why i’ve never been able to have any real, long term friends. why i’ve always just been used in my past relationships. why I always feel left out, and like everyone jokes about me behind my back. does anyone know what i’m doing wrong? is there some secret thing I had to do when I was 12 to be seen as human? i’m convinced that it has to be me. i’m willing to take any suggestions. any criticisms. 

obviously this is just brushing the surface but I already feel like a jerk for wasting your time, if you’ve read this far. and if you have? thank you. thank you for listening to me rant and complain. I’ve never asked for help or posted anything like this before. i’ve never wanted to waste anyone else’s time, and i’ve always felt like a coward. I just didn’t have the energy to fight it tonight. so thank you."

2451,depression,Eating Disorders from Depression,"It started as me drinking to drown my sorrows the past month or so, worsening in the past week due to personal events that lead to me drinking so much that i blacked out and lost an entire day, I've never in my life drank like that.

I've still alcohol here.. but new issues have cropped up where a DR has pointed out during all this I've formed 2 eating disorders..  Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) as well as Purging disorder.   


I've been with friends where I've maybe picked at food a tiny bit then hope they don't notice i entirely stop, when i try to eat more than my stomach is used to i get uncomfortably full and it begins to hurt.. then i do what i can to purge it.. AKA I'm lactose so I'll drink milk or eat something i know my body hates and will reject.. that also being alcohol on occassion.  


Honestly I've emotionally lost all of my fight, I've lost it before, many times.. but bounced back within weeks-month and been back to my old self, but this has been a constant spiral and the thing hurting me has pushed me to a point where i don't have the energy to return, nor do i think i want to..  


I've avoided my family, i've not spoken to my son in weeks and feel its better off i don't get in touch, he hasn't seemed to notice anyway?.. seems everything i love has fallen away from me and I'm just slowly killing myself..

i truly believe no one else feels and thinks like i do. i feel so alone in such a huge world of people. No one is real everyone acts like bots. i don’t know how to feel normal again. i am not meant to be here. who cares if i get everything i want. its not enough. i will never be happy no matter who i am or where i am. i shouldn’t be a waste of a form of life. i literally can’t understand why the universe put me here. i am too different from everyone. i don’t know why this soul chose me to be here. to live this lifetime. i have tried to put good things out in the world i never receive anything back. i have asked the universe for help. nothing. i have begged to all those watching over to help my girlfriend to get better. i have prayed on my knees to the moon and stars to give me a sign, nothing. i am at my lowest point again i’m in this deep hole and i really can’t get out this time. i hate this place, there’s too many evil stupid people. why does no one see the world like i do??? social media is truly evil for those who look up to it to be themselves it has changed every person’s personality i know once you get hooked you change. i’ve seen my friends become demons. i don’t trust anyone maybe that is the lesson my spirit is pushing me to learn but i can’t dude. what will it matter im dead in the end anyways. i am constantly shut down by circumstances in my life no matter what. why did my soul choose for me to endure this life i don’t understand what the universe wants from me i’m stuck and i can’t get over this frustration i am going in fucking loops and at the same time i feel like i’m in a fucking dream that never ends this pain will never end i’m so tired of being sick of humanity because they’re fucking dumb as rocks bruh

i ruined everything i literally fucking ruined everything. it was so fucking good it was great it was amazing. and then bad shit happened on like 5 different occasions and i died and broke my brain everytime bc i mentally can’t take emotional pain because of having a traumatizing past. i felt like i could be safe with 1 person but when they’re black out drunk and start yelling at me like a demon has taken their body over from the underworld and is speaking manipulative shit in to my head from HELL,
just demonic horrible mind stripping  soul killing heart drop to your stomach head aching things that someone who loves you would never say “you really think someone like me ever would love you” “you think i loved you this whole time i faked it”
repeating all the same type of things to make it seem like my fault just literally everything at once is thrown at me i would say it just really hit me hard and haunted me so bad and every time this happens she says she doesn’t remember. i can’t be hurting anymore like i’m literally going to drop dead whether it’s intentional by suicide or if its from a broken heart i cant deal with any more brain damage pain theres a fucking knife being jabbed in me as slow as possible i don’t feel like finishing this i just dont know what else to say"
2454,depression,I feel like I'm doomed,"I ""woke up"" an hour ago, assuming I had even slept but I'm uncertain. Upon becoming more conscious, the first and only thought I could think of is questioning if I am doomed. I keep a journal to record my thoughts, which I had started doing recently, and I figured I would share what I had written to the internet, though I'm convinced nobody will really read it. I may or may not omit some things, I haven't decided.

Before I get started, I'd like to give a little background to who I am.
I'm a 25 year old line cook, and I like to believe I'm fairly good at my job. It's probably one of the few productive things that I'm actually good at, so I've maintained and improved my work skills over the past five years. Two weeks ago today, I had gotten COVID and luckily avoided many negative thoughts because I was too sick to focus on anything. I have recovered enough to return to work today.
But I think I'll just get started now.

______________________________

AM I doomed? Am I going to continue this path until I'm dead? Is there no way out of my financial hole, where I could possibly achieve some of my dreams and live the life I want, instead of barely scraping by and being forever in debt?
I'm starting to think-- well, not starting, but I think I'm fucked.

I don't think I'm ugly. I don't think I'm necessarily unfortunate in many cases. I'm fairly skinny, tall, and despite my glasses that make my eyes look huge, I've got that going for me. I have a family that loves me, even if it's only immediate.
But I feel like that's it.

I have few friendships, and I believe that the number is few because I'm a bad friend. I miss my dad (who had died ten years ago), partly because I feel like he could have taught me more on how to be a better man. I may have come a long way in the past ten years, yet I feel like my life is ultimately useless. I benefit no one but myself, and only I am to blame on that front.

My debts weigh heavily on my shoulders. I spend too much to actually invest in a vehicle; I spend too much to actually pay my debts. I make too little to do what I want to do. I have spent less than a day, in the last five years, vacationing. I think I'm absolutely fucked. I don't think I can fix myself.

So what do I do? Get counseling that I can't get to? Or continue dwelling on my problems that my father had asked me not to do in his farewell letter to me that I had lost?

Sometimes, like this, I feel like death is my only answer, only I'm too much of a fucking coward to do it myself. I don't like thinking about it because of the implication, but my mother is the biggest reason. My sisters may be able to move on, but my brother would likely be devastated, though I feel he's not long for this world either. That's why I *wish* for death. It's an excuse that can keep my family going.
I really do not believe my life is going to improve; It's only going to get worse, and it's my own damn fault.

I wish for my own death.
______________________________

After I finish posting this, I'm probably going to write in it again, telling how I'm a whore who expresses his emotions on the internet as a cry for attention. In a way, I don't think I'm wrong. I don't know who is going to read this, if anyone, but regardless of whether or not *you* believe any of this is of no concern to me. I know this is how I feel.

No, I'm not going to call a suicide hotline, even if the thought does weigh heavily in my heart. As of right now, I know I'm not going to kill myself. I'm too much of a bitch to actually carry out *anything*, even if it was initially a plan to make my future better like getting a car, or even further, a fucking license. Regardless of if I even *had* a plan of any sort, getting COVID and recovering took a long enough time to set me back even further than I had anticipated.

This is all a burden that I carry always, and have carried for longer than ten years. I bought myself this expensive personalized journal and received it two weeks so I could at least *attempt* to get better mentally, and I had bought it because I know that I'm still going to be financially fucked any way I look at it, but so far it's just me complaining about my roommates and recent symptoms.

This excerpt was among the first things I actually bought the journal for. A hope for my future? Perhaps, a step in the right direction? I doubt it.
As I wrote, I'm fucked."

I don’t know if I am digging a hole for myself right under where I am standing in life or not.
2460,depression,My cat is missing,"My cat ran away from home about two days ago. She helped immensely with my depression and anxiety. I thought she was happy here and I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault. I feel like I just lost my best friend. She’s gone outside many times, but this is the only time she just left for good. I’ve spent hours walking outside looking for her. She’s not at shelters or anywhere. I’m trying to be positive and keep hope that she will come home, but it’s exhausting. Every time I go search and get excited thinking it’s her only for it to be another cat. Which others are great too, but I just want mine back. I’ve never had a pet runaway before and I just feel so sad"
2461,depression,My friend wrote an article recently,"He sent me his writing to read, it was not even a great article. He's not great at language.

But this made me realize - he had motivation. I wanted to write since forever but can never make myself start. And it felt really strange to see a person who just... does something. I saw that it's impossible to be understood by non-depressed people, since I can't understand their healthy, motivated perspective.

I started thinking about other situations, where I saw people doing things they're interested in, just because they can and want to. It made me realize that I'm not ""lazy"", but there is something seriously wrong with my mind. It's a scary realization, but somehow comforting. For the first time I was able to accept that I'm not just weird, but actually sick."

Everything right now is painful and I’m not sure how to escape it. I don’t want to fight with anyone, I don’t want to have any chaotic energy or interactions. I just want that light in my life to find it’s way back to me. Or for me to find it?  I love Avery with my whole heart I can say that for sure but I’m just now realizing how much I’m holding back on her cause I’m so lost and on the verge of breaking down. Nothing excites or stimulates me, I’m a failure.  Even when trying to go to
school to pursue the thing I loved, I was not energized or fulfilled enough to pursue it properly, I just simply exist, there is so sound or motion in my life. I want to escape this repetitive and stuck body but at the same time I don’t try to, and I don’t have the drive, I have burnt out and I feel like death is the only remedy. Suicide if the only thought that seems logical."

I dont like my major and i dont think i could live a life doing anything with it as a job. Why am i making myself suffer when i have no passions or aspirations or anything i find joy in."
2466,depression,I never NEVER do anything right,"And when I say this I truly mean it, there is always something I do wrong or can't do by myself.. Some stupid mistake I make that nobody else even thought of doing, misunderstanding things, forgetting them, not being able to keep up, not being independent, giving up before even trying, not knowing how to say no, being insecure, being bad at literally everything that isn't blindly staring at my phone and mindlessly scrolling for hours.
I have no brain power at all and I have never hated myself so much. I used to be smart (at least in school) and I thought that I would start getting smarter (life wise) but that just isn't happening. I'm in my second year of college and my course work is already a disaster. I missed my first exam because I didn't study at all during the weekend. I don't know my way around the city all that well, I am in a friend group but I don't talk to any of them outside of uni or when we decide to meet up because I don't feel like they would even want to talk to me. I would like to think that I am like this because of my mental health (I don't mean to self diagnose but I'm pretty sure there is something wrong with me tbh) but maybe I'm just dumb and I'm now being forced to face it instead of just hiking myself in my room and remaining in blissful ignorance.
I gave no hobbies that actually require skill, I don't know how to swim and everytime I need to use my brain I go into a state of confusion that makes me do the stupidest things. I don't if it's anxiety or what but it sucks.
I don't want to get up in the morning, I always do tho. I go to my online classes but I never pay attention (I'm in one rn actually), I need to organize myself but I don't know where to start, I need a lot of help but I'm ashamed to ask because it just forces me onece again to realize just how dumb I am.
I always tell my parents everything is fine but everything is not fine and all I want to do most of the time is quit this year of college and go work and make my own money. Get my driver's license and actually prove to myself that I'm not useless. But the truth is that it isn't that easy because I actually have people I consider friends here and breaking the news to them would be nothing short of awful. I don't see things getting better unless I make a radical change but I'm always putting it off.
I don't know where I'm going with this but if you read this far thank you truly."

My grandma is old,she is in her late 80s and I overheard she threw up again, and she already has a stroke and now the thought of losing her while she can't remember me makes me hate my life more.

Im really sorry I just wanted to vented so bad."
2471,depression,Depressed and badly heartbroken,"I have recently came out of an abusive relationship with my ex girlfriend. She used to abuse me emotionally psychologically and then finally physically. 

I found out she was escorting and dominating for money and took her back. I also found out she was sleeping with other men and I took her back from it all. I loved this girl so much. But when I look back on it I don’t think she ever loved me. I think she was dominating me and getting off on it. She displayed real narcissist behaviour such as gaslighting me. Building me up and tearing me down. Used to even call me her little lost puppy. Never used to show empathy. She used to regularly laugh at her ex boyfriends she claimed she “broke their hearts”. 

I couldn’t even tell my friends What was happening out of sheer embarrassment. 


I live in a gang area in the us. And come from a low income housing project. Once I was on the way home and saw a man killed while on the phone to her. There was nobody else on the road just me and this guy. We was both wearing “urban” style clothes. He turnt out to be an innocent man. This could have been me if I hadn’t gone a different way, I only went that way because my ex had called me and I wanted to talk to her. So I took a longer route. I used to smoke weed but it just had me thinking of me watching this guy die. It used to give me anxiety attacks. Uncontrollable shaking. She noticed that and used to play on it. Saying she gave me a place out the hood to come to. 

She used to always hit me and strike me and I used to restrain her. Until the last time. 
It ended with a big fight and I finally hit her back. 
Her last words she ever said to me before I hit her was “can’t you see I don’t respect you. You’re f***img me after you know I have had sex with other men”


She went to the police and filed false reports on me which broke my heart so badly. I was in jail dreaming that the charges would get dropped and she would tell the truth but she never did. I felt so betrayed because I stuck by her through everything. She used to cry in my arms while I rocked and kissed her to sleep. She was my first love. 

I am now facing legal battles against her vicious lies trying to defame my character. She always promised I couldn’t be happy if it wasn’t with her. And now she’s going through with her plans. 

I find it hard to eat regularly. 

I go to sleep and wake up in the middle of the night and can’t get back to sleep. Then sleep all day. 

The “hood” I live in regularly innocent people are killed by accident and it’s not advised to be out by yourself for no reason. But it’s weird I’m not scared of anything anymore just numb. 

I have thought about ending it all but I been through so much even before her. 
I can’t have been through all that to go out like that. 
That means she will win. 

I’m a really good hearted person and sometimes
I feel to become a heartless villain and never show anybody love again. But she would still win because she would have changed me forever. 

All this while she’s enjoying her life. Has a new boyfriend. And regularly cryptically taunts me through her social media accounts. 

Tldr; I’ve been broken by somebody who was my bestfriend. I don’t know what to do. I’ve never felt so low in my life."
2472,depression,Martyred by hands his own.,"This is my first time writing on reddit. I used to have a passion and a focus in my mind and I had a whole plan of what I wanna be in 5 years. This was back in 2015. I'm 22 years old now and shit couldnt have hit the fan harder than it has in these 5 years. And the worst part is it's all my own fault. I wont blame fate or life or anything  like that because I am the architect of my own undoing and I've dug myself deep enough into rock bottom that I cant climb out of it now. I want to live and thrive but there seems to be no hope. I hesitate to call myself a martyr but that's what comes to my mind when I think of the difference between who I am today and who I was 5 years ago. There seems to be no way out. And even if there was, my lazy and worthless ass would destroy that hope too. I sound disgusting. I am. And I wouldnt expect to not be berated here for what I've done with all my time and my means."
2473,depression,rant,"am I a product of my environment? are my sexual tendencies caused by the constant slut shaming recurved from my parents since I was young or am I making up excuses? 

I remember vividly the time I did my makeup when I was about 10 years old, I was so proud and went to show my dad, in which he called me a whore. I ran away crying and later he came and apologised, saying he was upset and took it out on me. 

I don’t think I’ll ever forget that, and alongside the more subtle slut shaming by calling my outfits slutty or “whore-ish” and my mum constantly assuming whenever I go out I’m secretly hooking up with someone, I think I’ve finally lost all self respect I’ve ever had. 

At this point I don’t even care, I already know what they think of me and I’m not surprised, but it still hurts knowing your own parents look at you that way. 

These are the same people who vow to love me no matter what, and to never make me feel less than enough, yet they manage to make me feel the absolute opposite AND make it feel like it’s my own fault. 

Is it? I can’t tell. Maybe it is my fault, maybe I shouldn’t have kissed that one guy, maybe I did this all to myself. Is this a form of self destruction? I don’t know."

2475,depression,Am I depressed?,"I know self diagnosing is the worst, but I am too afraid to go to therapist and I tried to talk to my sister and mom about it. But my mom says ""just think of happy thoughts and you won't be sad anymore"" or ""Do you think a mother wants to hear their daughter being depressed?"". And my sister rarely replies to me or read my texts. 
In the past I was very suicidal because how my mom used to treat me. When we argued she would say that I'm trash, a piece of sh*** and she would hit me, sometimes threaten me with a knife.
She doesn't treat me like that anymore, but it left a scar on me.
Now I am attending college and live in a dorm so I don't get to talk to them face to face.
 The reason why I  believe I may have depression is because I feel numb, worthless, and a waste of space. But these feelings are hidden and I have always kept it hidden. I blocked these emotions for years and it started to come back to the surface.
I want to talk to someone about feeling depressed, my roomate at least or my Uncle (who I rarely talked to, but I know he knows what it feels like), but I have trust issues. I don't want them to report me, or tell my mom about this. Since I'm not going to take action, but I just want someone to talk to.

Sorry if its confusing to read, I'm not that good at writing."

But I think we're not good for each other as friends because we've been getting into a lot of fights and to avoid a lot of fight I let a lot of things slide with her (she won't was the dishes for a few days after she's cooked) and I don't really do a lot of housework either. We don't really hang out and I can never seem to be on her level intellectually. When ever we fight I'm always the bad guy and maybe I am... I moved in with her because I thought we would be able to help each other out with negative self talk and obviously it hasn't worked. I feel like I'm getting worse and I'm passing that onto her but I also just want to never admit I'm wrong anymore even though I have to....

2479,depression,My mom finally understood,"This last month has been the worst of my life. I started seeing a psychiatrist and a psychologist in September, but I still haven't gotten a diagnosis or started with medicines. A couple of days ago I attempted suicide, my mom doesn't know but my psychologists do, and they want me to go inpatient. I will know when on monday.                 
                
Recently my school has started online classes again, and I can't bring myself to focus. No matter how hard I try, I can't. I don't remember the last time I did my homework. I talked about this with my therapist and they told me it's okay (which made me feel a lot better, because I was blaming myself), and that it's better if, until I start feeling better, I stop trying to focus or do my homework or to do anything in general. I told this to my mom, and finally she said that it's okay. We cried together for like an hour, and decided that I will take a break from school. I feel kinda guilty, but I do feel better. Even though none of my friends checked up on me today that I missed 3/4 of my classes. But it's probably because they're used to me skipping school lol.

The law won't do nothing about it, the police officers simply said that they don't believe my X stole money because military veterans don't do bad things. So now I am wondering on how do I tell my young daughter and autistic son that we will be struggling this month cause all I got to our name is $15?

2481,depression,Understand thy neighbour,"What happens when you no longer feel like doing anything anymore?  Laying in bed until the afternoon.. Binge eating or under eating. Gaining lots of weight or losing a tone of weight. Spending countless hours on the phone scrolling through media that means nothing to you. Losing confidence in one self, suicidal thoughts, suicidal attempts.

Do only “weak beta fools” experience this as some of us like to say? As much as it is wise to not be a victim in life we do have to accept the fact that our environment can play a huge role in our mental state. You will find it difficult to thrive when you feel you have no control with your life, you cannot create when working a job that is unfulfilling. You will find it hard wear a smile on your face when those around you lack understanding of why you might behave in a certain way and you certainly will find it challenging to want to stay alive everyday since you feel nobody has interest in your wellbeing. “Uh but life is tough so sit down and shut up and make better choices!” Do not say such things to an individual you would suspect to be depressed. “Depression is just an excuse for laziness!” There is nothing I dislike more than those who speak like that, thinking that what worked for them is going to work for everyone else. Don’t be a fool, parents, friends and teachers make this mistake all the time when someone closes to them is having a difficult time with their mental state. 

If you know anyone in your household, work or friend group who you suspect might be going through this, avoid your pointless un-empathetic nagging with your “tough love” you might eventually actually drive them to suicide just in case you didn’t know.. “oh but it’s not my responsibility if someone kills themselves or not”. Well... Of course it isn’t and to be quite frank the whole world could blow up tomorrow and it will not make a difference to the rest of the universe but I will say this... Everyone is different, circumstances do affect someone’s choice makings in life and does affect the way someone is going to respond to adversity and those people who had any form of hardship no matter what the hierarchy of the pain was will be sensitive. “Oh but you can grow out of it”. Sure but not with those around them who mock and ridicule them. Make an effort to listen to your neighbour, love your neighbour. It’s hard time for all of us for sure. Don’t be a fool and make the effort to understand the other person before making irrational assumptions please. ❤️🙏🏽"

2489,depression,"How does someone with depression and potentially toxic behaviors deal with being single, feeling so lonely, yet avoiding relationships because they don’t want it to become toxic or abusive? What can I do?","I don’t know where to post this, but hopefully it’s here. If not please delete.

I (25F) have had major depression since elementary school, but I believe I might also have something else a bit stronger, maybe bipolar or BPD. I’m not on meds because I’m not in a position where I can afford therapy and medications because of physical illness I’ve been dealing with that’s taking up my money right now.

A bit of backstory, I was bullied often as a young girl, particularly by boys, and sometimes it even got to the point of physical abuse (yes, by boys). A lot of times it was because of my depression symptoms or my physical illness symptoms (struggling to stay on top of self-care, bloat, weak muscles, ) In college, I was sexually assaulted twice. My only relationship was technically a lie (he told me it was a prank). I have had flings but, they resulted in me developing feelings of attachment so I purposely sabotaged them because I didn’t feel like the feelings from the guy were legitimate, and I was just being used for humor or sex, and I didn’t want to get hurt. My feelings of attachment became toxic, somewhat obsessive, so sabotaging the relationships I thought were good even at the expense of me being “crazy”. I don’t want anyone roped into my mess and hurt them, I do not want to be a toxic or abusive person. 

In my early 20s, being single was more or less ok, because most of my friends were not in serious long term relationships and I wasn’t alone, I still had people to spend time with. I also was still getting some male attention some of the time, as this was before my autoimmune disease went to hell and I gained 70 pounds in six months with no diet or exercise change that I haven’t been able to lose. This is no longer the case. I have lost most of my friends at one point of another due to my mental instability and ghosting, and my family has all started to move across the country. I don’t use tinder/dating apps and I don’t like going to bars alone, because this is how I got assaulted. And my self-esteem is so low from the weight gain I feel extremely unattractive. I feel like I don’t have anyone anymore, and I’m at a loss on how to meet people in a way that is safe and comfortable. My mom recently made a “joke” on how I was gonna be a “cat lady” when I got older and I cried that night. 

I feel like like anyone else, I want someone in my corner. A life partner, someone by my side who I can love and care for and do the same for me. Someone I can cuddle with, take road trips with, and spend Christmas with. It’s been years since I’ve had anything romantic, not that there haven’t been opportunities, but because of my fear of being toxic or unworthy of a healthy loving relationship. And then I feel lonely, and my depression gets worse. It’s a negative loop. I don’t want to depend on anyone to feel better, but I’m finding little reason to care about my current state when it feels like no one cares about me at all, and I would just be better off not putting my troubles on anyone and staying alone forever. I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I just want to be a loving girlfriend for a loving guy. Why is something so easy to say so hard to do..."
2490,depression,"Unable to answer the question ""Who am I?""","I feel like I'm running into the same walls over and over again. I'm sitting here questioning who I am, and what do I want in life? I'm a college student, a junior. I've lost all my steam for it. I'm in an art degree, a shitty choice I know but I'm not here to discuss the relative merits of an animation degree in a world where most animation is being outsourced to basically everywhere but here. I always had something that kept me happy about my major, some passion, some motivation that kept me saying ""Hey things are bad but I have this."" or ""I fucking hate school and don't want to do anything but I'll keep going."" Now I'm just at ""I fucking hate school."" I hate that I have to keep going, keep doing things. Meds are working in the sense that I don't want to hurt myself or kill myself. But when I think on whether or not I want to be alive I can't say. It just all seems pointless. No carrot, no stick, no desire to keep going. I think ""Who am I?"" And honestly I don't see anything there. I can no longer make sense of whether I actually enjoy the things I've enjoyed in the past or I just convinced myself that I enjoy them so I have some reason to keep going. The reason is gone, the motivation is gone, and any positive thoughts remain silent. I don't love myself, I don't hate myself. It's just apathy now. Something I should talk about in therapy for sure but right now everything just feels blank. Like sure I have good days but there's been this constant underlying feeling of emptiness. All I really enjoy lately is playing games and streaming but then I just feel guilty. That's my one saving grace lately is I've more or less stuck to my stream schedule. I stream because I like it, and because it's fun but of course I need to be overly critical. ""It's not like you're going to become popular. You should be doing other things, you can't just play games all day."" And I know this, I have other things in my life. I have a girlfriend, I go to college, and I have a boring desk job I attend twice a week that I dread but I need the money and it works with my schedule. On the outside my life seems pretty good, but on the inside it's mostly just this empty feeling. Like I'm doing things because I need to or other people expect me to and I can occasionally distract myself from this void with games and streaming, or watching movies with my girlfriend but even those things are starting to lose their shine. Everything just feels like it's melting into this big grey void. I get pockets of light, pockets of dark but more and more I find myself falling back into this emptiness, and feel like I'm there longer and longer each time. Sorry for rambling, and sorry if my post was nonsensical. I just don't know, I just felt like I had to put it out there. Thanks if you read this mess."
2491,depression,I’ve been having a really hard time lately and I’m scared I’m pushing people away.,"
I’m not sure if this is the right place but I just need to get a few things out. 

This year has had a lot of ups and downs for me mental health wise and it’s been really rough. At the start of the year I was struggling significantly and that resulted in multiple hospital visits and a psych ward admission. After my admission things didn’t get easier but I started having a good run a few months later that lasted for quite some time. 

Lately my negative emotions have started creeping back and my anxiety has been running wild. I’ve started having suicidal thoughts again and they scare me. I have a good support system outside of my family setting (which isn’t the best) and this makes me feel guilty for having these feelings. 

My boyfriend is one of my biggest supports and he’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met. He’s helped me through the toughest part of my life and is always there for me. Sometimes this leads to him having to experience me having these emotions. I know it doesn’t bother him but I’m always worried about how me feeling like this will effect our relationship. This has caused me to become slightly withdrawn and I’m terrified. I sometimes overreact about small things and although he’s show no sign of strain in the relationship I’ve convinced myself I’m ruining it. 

He’s never done anything and is constantly reassuring me it doesn’t bother him and he loves me but I’m absolutely terrified I’m going to ruin what we have. I love him so much but I’ve never had anyone support me like he has so it scares me a little. I feel like it’s unfair of me to constantly be telling him I’m scared he’s going to leave me because I’m depressed when he’s done nothing but reassure me of the opposite."
2492,depression,I wish Jobs took mental health more seriously,"I’ve always been prone to depression and anxiety but this pandemic has made it worse tenfold. I’ve tried telling my boss and another co worker in non direct ways that I’m feeling mentally drained and I am doing the best I can with the job I have. But he never gets it. He and my other coworker always are like “ oh you would never make it at my last job, it was so high stress” or “be thankful we have jobs while the economy is tanking” and I feel like he makes it worse and makes my anxiety worse by saying these things. I had to use a couple of PTO days just to recharge from dealing with him. When we have meetings, I try my best to engage but I think I sound a little down and not fully there. And then he makes it worse and is like “well you sound like you hate your job so maybe you should find something else” 

My depression is not that severe so I can get out of bed and I can do work but it definitely makes me irritable, zone out, hard to focus, and general anxiety abut the state of things all over the world. I wish the workplace had more sympathy for mental health wellness in these times and I wish managers specially were more sensitive. Has anyone else dealt with this? If so how do you make things better?"
2493,depression,How do I tell my parents I want a therapist?,I've been dealing with bottling up everything for a while now and it felt like it wouldn't come out now. I think I finally know what's making me that way but I really don't feel comfortable telling my parents or people I know because of what it is. I think if I needed to talk to a therapist they'd support it just because they're nice parents but I can't tell them what it is.
2494,depression,I hate,"School makes my depression worse and worse as every day goes by. I am failing with &lt;30% on every class and the people around me only make it worse. My family is just loud and unhelpful. I can barely finish an assignment without breaking down. Everyone only puts more pressure on me and makes things worse. I just want to disappear where nobody can find me and I won’t have to worry about school. This online class doesn’t make it any better. I feel like I can barely communicate with my teachers. I am lost and confused and angry at everything. It feels like nobody will help me; just loud chattering and the distraction of phone screens.

Sorry for the broken paragraph. I have too many things on my mind right now."

2500,depression,I was right,So I broke up with my girlfriend because the relationship was toxic and I was the only one actually putting in work. The thing was she kept asking for our group to hang with this one dude so I got real sus of him and turns out they like each other now which is great because I was right to be sus but it’s also not great because I feel like shit. Other than that I am a nervous wreck and honestly I hate every time I wake up in the morning because I have to see her. High school is the dumbest thing ever Atleast Ik I didn’t peak in high school because anything worse than this isn’t worth living. Thanks for reading.
2501,depression,What's the point..,"What's the point or purpose of life when everything feels like a dead end. When everything feels like it doesn't get better because once it does feel a bit better, it doesn't last. When everything feels like it isn't worth it anymore because there has been so much disappointments...I'm surprised I still am a good person in this world who cares more about others than myself when all I've been treated is like shit."
2502,depression,"Hit an ultimate low, and this is the first time that I've ever really considered suicide as being an option","I've hit rock bottom. My health has gone to complete shit. I have to force myself to eat anymore and I can only stomach one meal a day which I know is not healthy. I'm losing weight and my energy is depleted. My skin is dry and is sucked of life. My eyes burn and I'm constantly exhausted and unmotivated. My nails are falling apart due to obsessive biting and picking. My hair is even falling out in the shower. Clumps of it. I have bald spots. 

Emotionally I am either filled with rage or I'm numb. I'm having more panic attacks than usual and I've been having to take Xanax again after years of not needing Xanax anymore. I'm resorting back to drinking alcohol after months of giving it up and remaining sober. 

The one person who I had in my life has pretty much has abandoned me and refuses to talk to me because he claims that I fight with him too much even though all I wanted was for him to simply communicate with me and not ignore my messages for hours upon hours. 

I needed him last night and he wasn't there. He was instead playing video games and told me that he wished he stayed with his ex instead of trying to fix everything with me, whom I was cheated on by him with this said ex of his who he wishes was still around. 

Another person I try to keep in my life just consistently shits on me with his nonstop criticisms, judgments and unsolicited ""advice"" which only masks his true opinion on what he really thinks of me and overtime he has made it very clear that I am nothing but a burden to myself who is a victim to my own depression and that the reason I'm never going to beat my depression or become anything in life is because I am too weak and too stupid to do anything about it. 

I messaged him today just to try to talk to someone after my ex cut me out of his life just because me simply asking for some kind of consistency when it comes down to communication was too much to ask for my supposed ""friend"" blasts me about how ""resentful"" and ""judgmental"" I am when what I had messaged him had nothing to do with anything other than to just say hi. 

I am fucking beyond tired of this supposed friend of mine attacking me and putting me down and pointing out what the fuck is wrong with me every single goddamn day of the week when all I want to do is just be treated like a person and treated like a friend without having to be absolutely ripped to fucking shreds and seemingly so randomly scrutinized for every single thing that I say or do. I have never understood where it came from. And he is the most judgmental person I have ever fucking met in my life so where get he gets off flipping the script on me is beyond me. 

I have been nothing but nice to these people and they have just shit on me for years and I'm just starting to come to the conclusion that these people do not care about me at all and that I really don't have anyone to rely on. I am absolutely exhausted with my life. 

This is the first time that I've honestly considered suicide as a logical option because I am beaten up and I have no more fight in me to want to keep going on. I will never overcome this depression, like my friend said. It he's right about anything he's right about that, but it is not because I don't try because I do and I have and I've always ended up right back here no matter how far I get. It doesn't get better for some people and I am one of those ""some people."" I don't see a future for myself anymore. And I don't want to either. I want my future to be the ceasing of my existence since everyone in my life has made it very clear to me that I would not be someone they'd miss or even vaguely remember, and if they somehow did remember me they'd only remember that girl who was ""too annoying"" and ""too needy"" and too doomed from the start for anyone to truly tell her just how useless and unneeded she really was in their lives and in this world"
2503,depression,It hurts to see everyone succeed,I'm feeling down rn.

I keep trying to find things that make me happy but it’s just not the same anymore. Any satisfaction I get is only short term and it never lasts longer than like an hour. An hour till I go back to feeling like absolute ass. I’m so tired of this, I’m so tired of how hard it is to deal with the day to day when I constantly feel like I shouldn’t be here anymore. I’m starting to realize that that’s the whole survivors guilt nonsense but honestly I couldn’t care less about what it’s called when I am just tired of how it feels. I just don’t feel deserving of happiness, yet I’m so fucking terrified of a happy life. For some reason I have the bright idea to just go on and pretend that I’m okay when I haven’t been even remotely okay in a while. I feel like I don’t have anyone to talk to or trust. Which kinda fucking sucks but I’m starting to get used to just being on my lone sum, it’s easier to just not get involved. I’m tired of all of the heartbreak and sadness that comes with any form of relationship. I can’t tell if I’m thinking like this because I’m depressed or because I’m just loosing hope in humanity. Either way, it sucks and I’m just so tired of trying."

I feel like I'm just drifting through life. I don't want to kill myself.  I only feel good when I drink or eat or masturbation or smoke weed. Sometimes I think I don't belong anywhere. Used to believe in religion but now I question it. Ever since my mother died.  I pray sometimes. I just need a light or a spark in my life.

2507,depression,I wasted a month,"A while ago. I posted on r/unsentletters. I will leave the link to that post in the comments. Please read that, otherwise this may not make much sense.


For the last month, I have been working on my depression, trying to get better. I'll admit, it was probably for the wrong reasons as I was doing it to earn back a friendship, but whatever. I finally decided a few days ago to text her and ask her if I could have another chance. I told her that she was under no pressure to respond quickly, that I'd be fine. Now, one other thing I should mention. I only did this because in talking to her sister, who reached out to me, and my dad, who talks to my friend a lot, they convinced me that it'd be worth it. And so I did. Fast forward a few days, and I ask her sister how she thought my friend would respond. And she told me that my friend wasn't going to. I just wasted the last month fighting for a friend that had already moved on. And the worst things are first of all, this whole time I've been fighting fears that she had moved on. I kept telling myself it hadn't happened. Also, I can't even blame her. I completely understand why she left. I would have too. Maybe I should just save everyone the trouble and give up. I only cause pain anyways"
2508,depression,"Feeling that ""soul exhaustion.""","Sleeping is hard, feels like I never even went to sleep. I toss and turn, and then wake up in the middle of the night. I feel trapped in my own bedroom. It's all I ever see anymore. Maybe I should go on a hike. I gotta put down my phone.. social media sucks, I don't even really care about Instagram. Or Facebook. It's way too addicting. Usually buying clothes makes me even a little bit happy, but now, when I receive the clothing item, it's not like I can wear it anyways because of the pandemic. I stay in the clothes that I don't like. I miss people, not just my friends, but even just meeting new people. I try to socialize with my existing friends, but I never have much to say. Sometimes I don't have the energy to socialize, but I want to. School keeps me busy, along with extracurricular clubs and applying for scholarships. My soul is exhausted. But I don't know how to help it."

2510,depression,So you can know where I was at.,My mom is dying of alzheirmers. I'm struggling with my sexual and physical attraction to you. I resented you for not letting me live with you when I really needed to. I couldn't get past the mental barrier that was your affair. I hated when you gave other men more attention than me. I hated that I was barely in the loop when it came to the friend group. My dad is an abusive alcoholic. I was panicking every day. I failed college. Cooper was struggling with his kneww surgery. I was trying my hardest. I hope karma is real because I did not deserve the treatment that proceeded me this year. I will cut ties with my friends and old life. I wish you'd join me but I'm done waiting for a day that will never happen. You're behavior is sketchy and questionable. You stalk me on reddit while Ina committed relationship. You ciritized my ex for doing this but look at you. You hide your relationship status on Facebook with me and your new guy. You hang around the friends that would always put me down. We were best friends but you left me for my worst nightmare. Y'all still hang around each other with impunity and honestly it's kind of weird. I won't be reaching out to anyone you know. Best of luck to you. I didn't think I'd end up like your ex but I did
2511,depression,I feel lost and life is passing me by... What do I do?,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I feel like people here might understand... 

I’m 25M, I graduated from college a few years ago, and I’ve basically been living at home since then. I went through college and did really well academically. But besides my GPA and diploma, I didn’t come out with much (no job lined up or history of internships during college). I’ve had the luxury/curse of having my mom’s support, at least financially. So for the past few years, I’ve just been sitting on my hands, making no progress towards anything, at all.

I’ve never had an actual job. And it’s not exactly because I lack desirability. I just haven’t applied much. In the past few years till now I’ve thought a lot about what the hell exactly I want to do in life. No answers. I deal with major depression, so that’s been a huge weight on me (and I’m now working on it). But I think the bigger problem here is that, although I see a lot of things I’m interested in, I don’t see anything I actually want to pursue. For example, I’ll get interested in the work consultants and portfolio managers do, but then I’ll think more about it and realize it goes against what I envision for myself. I’ll just be a cog in a wheel that churns out money for people who don’t need it. I feel like I would make good money but feel like I’ve betrayed myself... so I drop the idea. As another example, I see myself possibly working in a NGO which promotes a cause I actually care about like poverty. But then the job that’s available to me is something like a social media manager or fundraiser associate. Sure, the cause is good, but the work is something that would make me feel like a slick bastard buttering people up and playing politics. And you might say I should maybe go to graduate school so I can get a position I’d actually like, like researcher at a NGO. But the thing is, I need to have the passion for that kind of work to pursue it and make it through the years it takes to finish graduate school. I’ve never felt that passion post-graduation.

I feel like I can’t do work that has no meaning to me, that doesn’t “purpose” written all over it. I realize that I have a lot of options open to me. It comes down to me picking one. But that’s what I’m stuck on. I kind of want to pick all of them and none of them... I know I’m extremely picky, in so many aspects of my life. And I so wish I wasn’t.

I’m sorry for the long post, I just wanted people to understand exactly what I’m struggling with. I’m wondering, for anyone who’s had these struggles similar to mine, 
Did you find something that gave you a feeling of purpose in life, something you work hard on because it’s important to you personally? How’d you find it?
If you never found that, what did it take for you to go on with your life and stop being static?

Thank you for reading... hoping I can start living because I’m just here watching it all go by and I’m starting to feel invisible. Thanks."
2512,depression,I’m afraid of my own mental health,"I am in my early twenties, just graduated college and moved across the country. I’ve had a lot of ups and downs with my mental health, but I’m really afraid because my dad has an emotional break at about my age that spiraled his mental health since. I see signs of this in myself and even though I’ve been in therapy before I’m not now. Idk what to do and I’m afraid my depressive and anxiety filled days will overtake the others."
2513,depression,tired.,"it takes courage for me to open up with someone and im really shy and quiet in person.

it's funny how the person you thought will help u overcome your anxiety and depression is the person who will just make it worst.

i will never and ever talk about myself to anyone, no one really cares anyway. :)"

2515,depression,I can’t handle this constant pain anymore.,"I’m so fucking tired of everything. I’m tired about being anxious over everything. My family life is shit and I won’t get to live normally for potentially upwards of 2 decades (I’m trans with no support network and help of that nature is exceedingly hard to get and expensive). It has me reconsidering what I really want to do. 

Sometimes I consider turning to drugs or other such pastimes in some attempt to gain even the remotest sembalance of happiness. Only thing that stops me is my own guilt &amp; the law at this point. 

I want to sleep but I’ve even dreaded that as of late. If I go to bed it’ll be morning again and then I’ll have to deal with other people’s problems piled on top of my own mental anguish. 

I’ve lost my dream career. (Film - it’s inherently public and I’d rather not show my face or anything else about myself on account of being trans and not wanting my entire legacy to be “you were trans!” - I’d rather just live a normal life where I get treated as I see myself but in order to have the slightest chance at achieving that I pretty much need to give up the rest of my youth and my dreams.) 

Everything else is so boring or tiring that I just don’t even bother at this point. All I want to do is sleep and watch YouTube. I generally don’t even get the ability to do that seeing as my friends dump their own problems on me and I’m generally worried sick with anxiety over how they’re doing. 

Please help. I need something. Some words of encouragement. Something to tell me that there’s hope. It feels like I’m being punished for existing. I never got a normal childhood or adolescence and it seems the shit will simply continue until i die."
2516,depression,Boyfriend of 3.5 years cheated on me for 6 months,He's the only person who's ever loved me in the way I thought I deserved and now it feels like I can never be loved completely and fully by anybody. I'm so alone and I'm so sick of my life it's hard not to relapse. It's hard to be sober. It's hard to care about anything going on in my life. I want to die. This is not something I can come back from. Too much has happened in my life for me to start over again just to be betrayed like this again. 3.5 years of my life down the drain. I cannot function. We had a cat. We were signing a lease. I did not plan to be alone like this. I did not plan for my life to be filled with hatred and sadness and just numb. He should have been helping me with dinner tonight. He should have helped me build the chairs today. He should be paying half the fucking rent. I'm all alone.

2517,depression,I Don't Want to Do This Anymore,"I don't have a life. I want one, but I don't have one. I don't know how to meet people. I don't know where I'm supposed to meet people. I don't even care it's a global fucking pandemic anymore. 

I'm tired of having to answer the question ""So what did *you* do this weekend?"" with ""Nothing."" I'm tired of having happiness fill me with rage.

I'm tired of everything making me bitter.
I'm tired of everything just letting me down. Online dating? Fucking sucks for average people, even worse if you're a loser. Writing contest? Haha. Good luck. Luck of chance meeting of people? Yeah like that's going to fucking happen.

Not like any of this matters since we're either going to end up in a dystopian hellscape or get fucked by climate change anyway, so I don' t even know why I care about finding happiness so much.

I have goals that keep drifting farther and farther away and no one gives a fuck.

So I don't want to do this anymore."
2518,depression,I lie to myself everyday about not being depressed.,"Every single fucking day I have to lie to myself and say I won't get depressed. It's a tangible thing inside me that if I give it one second of attention I get fucked. It's so exhausting. Any day now I'll finally give in again and just lay in bed all day praying that I don't wake up. 

I'll go to work. Come ""home"". Lay down. Pray that I don't wake up. 

Praying that I don't wake up makes me feel at peace. But when I wake up, it's like fuck, now I have to wait until tonight to pray I die again. 

I really made a lot of stupid decisions in my life. And I constantly go through a rollercoaster of depressed / pretending I can fight it. 

Fuck medication, it didn't do shit. The only result I get is when I get angry and say I'm not going to be depressed anymore. But it only lasts so long. I'm not as strong as people in my life think I am. And I know that they're just taking advantage of me. 

My body and mind are deteriorating at an alarming right recently for no apparent reason and all I want is some fucking relief. Oh yeah, I can't tell anyone because in this day and age I'll get fucking committed to the hospital, or better put, hospital jail. Fuck that place, I'm not going back."

She is dating another close friend and might be pregnant. Oh, then my friend died in a car accident last Thursday. I should also add I have recently started suspecting that I was molested when I was young.

I've had drug problems in the past, I've been sober for 7 months, but it's hard right now. Not even just the temptation to numb the pain, I just feel too young to be sober. I'm 17, I want to just be able to smoke a joint with friends or take some shots, I'm not even really wanting to do pills again. I don't know what to do, I don't want to do anything to numb the pain, I can live with the pain, I just want to be able to be like that with my friends again, unwind in that way.

2531,depression,Feeling locked in,"Recent events in my life have caused me to spiral even further. I've called a crisis line every day for like five days. They just tell me to hang in there, to keep doing what I'm doing. I'm taking care of myself as best I can but I can't get to sleep until like 3am, can barely eat, can barely leave the house. 

The few things I have on my plate aren't serving me well, I don't look forward to them each week and I often cancel. There's no one there or here at home for me to speak to about anything.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't identify anything that I want to do at the immediate, minute-to-minute level. I don't want to watch TV, or eat (not even junk food), or do things around the house. For whatever reason there is so much internal resistance at the thought of doing anything. I'm in unbearable emotional pain. And separately, the thought of doing nothing triggers anxiety over never changing anything, being told that I'm the only one who can pull myself out of it, never making anything of myself or having anything to respect myself for.

The only things I would probably have any motivation for would be things where other people show me they actually care about me and want to spend time with me. I was staring at the wall for a little while before I got the idea to walk to the other side of the house to grab my laptop, to check another post I had made a few days ago. 

I feel completely powerless. I dread the thought of things coming up that I am not preparing for (bands I play with for which I am not practicing music). I want to be doing well enough to keep going with those things, but I'm not. But I can't let go and I end up stuck doing things I'm not prepared for, which then makes me feel bad when I'm not doing things very well."

Been filling a little down for about the past year or so, and its been getting progressively worse.   The past 4 months or so,  suicidal thoughts have been happening more frequently.   I can honestly say the only reason I'm still here is because of my kids.  My wife found out about a week ago when I finally broke down and told her.  She does everything she can to help, but she struggles with slight depression and anxiety as well.   While at work,  I had time to think about it and pinned down the issue,  I think.   About the time it ask started all my friends I was stationed with PCSd.  Being an NCO, I'm usually the guy who has to be the bad guy and issue paperwork to the lower enlisted, so in my off time none of them want to talk to me much less be around me, and all the other NCOs seem to do their own thing.

I hate myself. I just want to stop it all. I just want to end it all. I keep wanting to jump off my house and land on my neck tonight.

In addition to this I live alone with no friends or family in a single room and sometimes feel like I'm in a prison. Lastly my girlfriend is in the US and is unable to come to Canada due to closed borders. Canada recently allowed partners to come visit, however since I am not a citizen I cannot ask her to come visit. All of this is really weighing on me and I'm losing my mind. I don't know how much longer I can hold on"
2541,depression,"You don't know me, but let me introduce myself.","I'm 16 years old and I've struggled with depression on and off for  6 years since my parents got a divorce. My dad neglected me for a while and wouldn't buy me food. He made comments about my weight and I started eating by myself and alone in the dark when I was in 6th grade. My dad worked long hours and he'd ignore my sister and I whenever we would try to talk to him. I had to raise my sister after that. He always invalidates my feelings after harassing me and telling him I have to tell him how I feel.

My mom struggles with mental illness and she was depressed after the divorce. She'd never come out of her room. She always picked fights with me and told me she couldn't wait until I went to my dad's house. My mom told me that I was almost the reason she killed herself and that I'm the reason she's on antideppresants. 

Plus so many other details, but I don't feel like writing them out.

The one thing that made everything better for a while was having a support system. Since the pandemic, I've lost all of my friends. Not a single person will answer my calls. I had my heart broken earlier and I was crying and I had nobody. Not a single person wants me or wants to talk to me. 

I would stay up all night to just have a normal conversation with the people in my life. 

I feel so let down and hurt. I just need to be told that I'm loved and I need support. I feel like I'm going crazy. 

As my depression has worsened, I've stopped eating as much and I'm just laying in bed all day. I didn't even think I'd make it to 16. There's truly no way I'll make it to college next year or to 18. I don't know if I want to run away or kill myself. I just can't do this anymore."

2543,depression,Just thinking,I moved from Alaska to Florida with my girlfriend that lived in Alaska with me for 2 1/2 years. Been here 10 months now. I have no friends. Nobody back home checks on me to see if I’m okay. I’m hardly making enough money to pay my bills and get by. Life has never been easy for me and it’s always been a struggle. I just want something to look up for me is all. I lost my grandpa last year to cancer and it still really affects me to this day. Mine and my girlfriends schedules never match up so the only time we get together we’re sleeping most likely so I don’t get to go out and adventure or do anything. I’m home sick and alone and sad.

2547,depression,Is it okay to settle for a life of relative comfort and unfulfilling contentment?,"For most of my life I’ve felt kind of lost and alone, and I don’t feel any kind of drive or desire to do anything in life. Growing up I was allowed next to no time to socialize with my peers outside of school, and I moved frequently on top of that, so losing friends became a part of life for me. My parents were often cold and cruel on top of that, hurting me physically and with their words for the crime of existing as I am. They often humiliated me and belittled me, but were nice when they wanted me to do something. 

I stopped moving for the most part once I reached middle school, and things started to get better. I was friendly with my classmates, and talked with them outside of school as well, but after middle school ended, many of us went to different schools, and I lost touch with them not long after. When I reached high school I felt so disillusioned with life that I felt if more of this was all I had to look forward to, then I would rather have no part of it. And so began the most self-destructive part of my life.

Despite my reservations, I knew that what I was feeling wasn’t healthy, and I wanted help. I knew I couldn’t rely on my few remaining friends since we were friends mostly nominally, and I couldn’t rely on my parents either. If it still isn’t clear why I couldn’t rely on my parents, they couldn’t have cared less about my mental health, and as far as they were concerned, there was no such thing. 

I initially tried reaching out at school, to my guidance counselor. I was performing poorly in a subject my first semester, and she requested a meeting with me, which I thought would be the perfect time. Due to fear of the school reaching out to my parents if I admitted anything directly, I decided to “cry out for help” using doublespeak and body language. I know this may make it seem like it’s my own fault, but I sincerely hoped she would understand that SOMETHING was wrong and ask more about it, at which point I would’ve elaborated. Unfortunately, she reacted in the worst way possible, in a way I never expected. She essentially laughed at me and looked at me like I was some miserable creature unfit to live, and this attitude would continue through all of my dealings with her until I ended up transferring schools.

Before I transferred schools, found someone else at my school who I could talk to. They acquired a therapist to work in the building in my sophomore year, and I started talking to her after I found out about her in my junior year. She soon had me hospitalized for suicidal ideation and I spent almost one month there. I was scared at first, but it really did help, and I felt so good by the time I was released. Sadly, it didn’t last. Despite ongoing outpatient therapy and varying medications for a little over 6 months, I spiraled down into a hell I never even imagined before my hospitalization. I genuinely believed it would’ve been better to have died than suffer like that, but I could barely pull myself out of bed most mornings.

As for what triggered it? Returning to my old life. I still felt good on the first day back. My parents pretended to be nice to me, but my mom snapped back to her usual self almost immediately, yelling at me and cursing at me, asking what the hell was wrong with me and calling me selfish and useless, as she always has. I then realized that my actual life would never match the fantasy I was shown in that hospital. I soon started cutting all of my classes at school, instead taking a nap in a quiet corner of the school. Eventually I stopped going all together. I had no friends who would go out of their way for me there, as up to then, I preferred crying in a corner feeling sorry for myself over socializing. My parents did not take this well as you can imagine, but I won’t get into that. 

I don’t know what triggered it exactly, but the following summer, I decided that I would start working hard for my future, not to be happy, but so that I can be free of my parents like I’d always wanted, and so that I can suffer alone in comfort, rather homelessness. After all, money doesn’t solve all your problems, but it’s better to cry in a Mercedes than in a cardboard box on the street. Any similar shitty quote works too. I got into a decent college not long after, majoring in engineering, mostly off of my SAT scores, but my grades my senior year were the highest they ever were. I managed to get lucky and nailed enough scholarships to get myself a mostly free ride. If I hadn’t managed that, I would genuinely rather have killed myself than bother taking on that much debt, in fact I had planned to if I couldn’t manage a workaround.

Despite their flaws, my parents have been rather supportive of me in college. I don’t mean that they’ve changed their ways, but they are supporting me financially. As far as their attitudes go, instead of trying to change them, I’ve finally settled for manipulating them to serve my interests. I’ve realized that they will never be the parents I needed, certainly not ones I wanted, but I only have to suffer them a little longer, then I can cut them off when I no longer need them. If you think this makes me as bad as them, it may, but in a different way, and I probably will end up maintaining some kind of relationship with them anyway.

Right now, I’m in my second year of college, and I’m doing well academically, and fine with my extracurriculars, but more and more I’m struggling to get myself to be productive. More and more, i’m sleeping in and sleeping late, and spend hours everyday binge watching anime (which I love, and is one of the few good things in my life, the others being sleep and music, mainly).

Despite everything, I still only work hard because I want a relatively comfortable life, working a decent job until I die. I’ve pretty much given up on friendships and dating at this point, and all I want is a quite life where I can be healthy, comfortable, and do the things I enjoy (like watch anime) outside of work. A part of me still wants to die and in my mind I don’t see myself living past my late 20s-early 30s and have no desire to. But I’m ok with that. I tried counseling services at school before COVID, but it wasn’t doing much for me. I can’t afford any other kind of care right now, but I doubt it’ll help anyway tbh.

Sorry if it seems a little incoherent or if the majority of this post seems unnecessary, I just wanted to give a little context to make it a little more clear how I got here. What do you think?"
2548,depression,I hate this,"I’ve seen several therapists and like 4 psychiatrists, been on a bunch of different medications, and none of it helps. 

My core belief, the one that cannot ever be changed by ECT, therapy, medications, family, or any remaining friendships, is that there is nothing I want more than suicide. No amount of positive thinking or CBT or DBT changes that I want to die. NOTHING WILL EVER CHANGE THAT, AND I DONT WANT IT TO CHANGE. I WANT TO KILL MYSELF AND NOT BE JUDGED OR STOPPED.

I’ve tried suicide several times, but unfortunately get my stomach pumped or am reported before I get to attempt. I’ve been to several psych hospitals, including Yale, and am still just as hopeless and worthless at the beginning. Nothing has changed my mind, only wasted my time. If anyone besides the terminally ill should qualify for euthanasia, it should be the people who don’t want to be alive. The people like me, who can’t and won’t be helped. 

ALL I WANT IS A HUMANE AND EASY WAY OUT. THERE IS NO ESCAPE FROM THIS. 

There is no end to the loneliness and wish to have never been born. Fuck everyone who waste time trying to discourage suicide. People who are determined eventually find a way, and others end up happy to see them go. I hope you all hope I can finally kill myself. I know you all can’t wait to see me leave this Reddit community alone."
2549,depression,Title,I’m a disappointment I’m useless that’s what my parent says about me it’s true i was never good at anything i get bad grades on top of that i’m lazy. But it still hurts a lot but recently i been getting numb i got into a fight with my dad a few days ago and instead of breaking up the fight my mom was helping my dad and then they told me how i shouldn’t hit back when my dad was the one that hit me first multiple times. There’s this one girl she’s like the sun in this dark world of mine but she left me too few days ago i’ve always imagine how great my life will be when i get older dating girls hanging out with friends but i never once imagine it’ll end up like this. I honest just want to die in a place where nobody will find me i don’t wanna cause any trouble to anyone after i die i’m tired i don’t have anyone. I keep telling myself it’ll get better but it isn’t i’ve only grown more numb as time go by. If you’re reading this i want you to know there’s always someone going through the same thing you’re going through you’re not alone. Anyways have a good day everyone.
2550,depression,I'm not attracted to anyone,After my first girlfriend broke up with me it just left me with wanting. Ive talked to countless girls but not a single one have I been attracted too. There's always something wrong with them whether I dislike their interest or something else. The worst part about my standards is I put myself on those standards too. Every time I do something that I find cringe or something I judge myself I know I mostly do this because of my judgemental parents and it's rubbed off on me a lot. I feel shackled to my own standards and I feel as if I'm destined to not meet anyone I can give affection too.

I'm talking about my closest friend, though I'm probably not his closest friend. We'll call him Karlson.
A few months ago, Karlson told my (In a joking manner) that he was depressed. I realized he was actually being serious, and whenever I think about it, it makes more and more sense. I shrugged it off at the time, but it's been eating me up inside ever since. I feel terrible about it, but I have no idea how to bring it up to him, and I really feel like I should.
Any help would be greatly appreciated."

I think I have know about them for a while, but just put it off as no problem. Well recently I have been waking up in the middle of the night, not being able to get back to sleep for hours, having constant day dream/ nightmares, and just being heavily ""unbalanced"".

I just wanted to share This hopefully someone gets it and gets something from it maybe I can motivate someone els."
2556,depression,"Moments of true happiness are obscured by feelings of fleeting, sadness","I’m sure this is normal. I’ve talked about it before.

I’m confident and have few serious body issues. I like my job. I love my wife. I love my parents and my friends. But I’m still sad at night.

Moments of joy are ruined by the creeping feeling of temporariness. 

Today I had a wonderful day with my wife and an extremely positive and optimistic evening. But the feelings of death, that this moment can’t last forever, and the death of myself and the subsequent ruining of my loved ones lives... all of those feelings distract me and bum me out. 

It makes me almost want to spend less time with my wife so that the feelings of happiness aren’t there in the first place.

I love her, and we’ve been together since we were teens, and I don’t know how either of us would function if one were to die. 

How do you deal with these feelings? The fear that all of this will one day end, and others will inevitable be left with sadness and incompleteness? How do I stop being sad when I’m happy?"
2557,depression,Why is it insisted I stay alive?,"Trigger warning I guess, I need to go off. If you're feeling down, please don't read this, I'm going dark. I need to ask some hard questions and present some hard angles as I've seen them. I decided against the suicide reddits because I'm really not planning that or feel near it. Quite the contrary, I'm at the moment feeling a bit angry that I don't feel free to.

Now I know I should be grateful for the stigma because it's helped me stay alive, but that again assumes, circularly, that I want that.

Why does everyone care so much if I kill myself?

So here's the story of me, a screwed up trouble child depression kid who beat the odds, won it all, and just fucking lost it.

Now I grew up... I was a dick, to be short and understated. Maybe I deserve all this, but here's why I don't feel up to the life thing rn other than not wanting to hurt people...

My Fiance is leaving me, we've been together since just after highschool, met in school. Classic highschool sweethearts, but we were everything but normal. My life was really really shitty before we got together and she made it amazing. We made each other's lives better no doubt, got along decent, pretty common there. Won't share details but we're still great friends (for now, more on that later, I might just be deluding myself honestly) and staying rooming together for the time until certain things can get sorted out, but there's no chance of getting back together, or rather, there's ridiculously little chance, and nothing I could purposely do would really help. No one did anything wrong, I don't get to hate her, it's just over.

Here's the fucking thing though. I just don't want to live without her, and fighting for her back just isn't a thing here.

Now when I say I don't want to live without her, I'm sure a lot of people's first thought is ""codependency for sure"". But here's the thing, chaps, it's not that life is the worst thing ever without her, it's not that I can't breath because she's a drug I need (although mild versions of those things have certainly been felt recently). I just loved her, and it just hurts that she's gone, and everything seems shitty now, I don't want it. She's gotten over it super quickly, that's how she is, and she's pretty much just excited now, I'm still devastated. 

Now look I'm completely aware I could make this life whatever I want, but I don't fucking want anything. I want a person and you can't have whatever person you want, they're people, when they go they go. So what is the fucking point? I start over? I go, ""oh well yeah that hurt like fuck let's go another decade with someone and maybe we'll get lucky and someone will die before the relationship collapses""? Or I could just fuck and be single my whole life, and die lonely, both great options /s.

So here's the big Q.

Why can't I just give a calm no fucking thanks, honestly? Exit the game?

If everyone wasn't pushing stigma... just no thanks. If everyone would just let me leave, just no thanks. I want to exit the game, it's just fucked and I don't like it. People don't even have the same concept of death, how is this so universal? 

And thus here we are with the only reason I remain in this world being that it hurts other people if I leave. Is this hell? What kind of place makes you beg for death while telling you it's off limits and will cause other people the pain that makes you want death? What a mind job...

I just wanted her. That was it. I was simple, I just wanted love and I was good, other shit sucked ass but I didn't care, I had her. As far as I was concerned everyone and everything else could suck it because I had finally won. I saw people talking about how much dating sucks these days all the time on facebook and shit, thought it just seemed disgusting, unfulfilling, and I was so grateful. I was so grateful y'all. I wasn't snoody about it like ""these people are stupid for dating"" I was just so happy I had my person and she made me happy and we were set. We weren't having sex near the end for various reasons, but I saw all the sex and stuff on TV, thought ""don't need that, I found the one, that's all I need, that's all those people are doing is just looking for what I have right here, thank fuck"". 

That was a couple weeks ago, that guy was on top of the world. He worked hard to get there, too. Fought depression his whole life. He thought for a brief moment, ""wow, it really IS worth hanging in there"". He thought every once in a while a good thing would actually happen, that real lasting happiness was real. It's not, it's fleeting, best case scenario you die. So that's why I can't die? I'm waiting for the best case scenario, which is also dying, just at a less convenient time?

Now she's leaving, and maybe we'll be friends, but single me (long time ago) was a jackass who made any woman (really anyone) hate him within a week or two tops so we'll fucking see. For a moment I though, I REALLY thought, that I wasn't that fuckup of a guy anymore, but I'm already kind of stirring up trouble to be vague. 

She helped me get through college, I'm 6 months tops away from a degree, I should have a car soon, I have some cool projects in the works that should bring in some money...

But all of that was for us. I never had much ambition, wanted a pretty simple life, liked to have fun with friends, was always crushing on someone. But after I met her, oh man, I wanted to build the world for us. I could finally picture the townhome with the picket fence that used to disgust me, and the home projects, and the dog, and we got a dog, we have a dog, I always always wanted a dog. I didn't want a dog alone. They were my family, I don't much talk to the rest of my family, they're mostly angry and judgementally religious. Now I'm sleeping on the couch because sleeping in the same bed is uncomfortable.


So now I'm stuck in this position where I materially speaking have near nothing, though I don't really care. I have a lot of material potential though, but I don't fucking care for it. Im working on my projects because I know I'm supposed to. They'll make me money which I won't want, so I can buy things which I won't fucking want, so I can go on living which I also don't fucking want. I'm doing all of this mostly just to look okay for other people.

I'm exhausted. I fought hella mental disorders my whole life. It was so hard. I fought for our relationship, we both really, really did. It was so hard. Battled financial struggles, family struggles... All hard. College? Hard as fuck and I tried to start a business while doing it, which I had to leave after sinking a year into it, which was hard. It was all so fucking hard.

All the while I believed it would get better.

And it did.

Then it got worse, fucking collapsed, all at once. It's not poetic, it's not well written, there's no fate, no comedy here, no happy ending. Certainly no choose your own ending. Just a shitty twist that made no sense and a ""to be continued"". To be continued with what? Fuck this book, right?

Like, just why? You fight like hell just to get shat on.

So here I am, living for all of you I guess. Living with a figurative mask on because I told her she shouldn't worry about me because I don't want to be a burden, even though I want her to worry about me because shes the only person who really ever gave a shit about me. Here I am living in a world id rather exit because you all demand I stay. Figuratively speaking, I have to wonder if you're demons or fellow prisoners. Do you convince me to stay in attempt to convince yourself it's worth it? Or perhaps a sense of obligation created by higher ups?

The children's stories speak of love, and tell you to ignore the material world.

Then people inevitably lose someone they care about in one of infinite ways and we turn around and say ""you'll find someone else, don't worry about it, look you still have money, isn't that great?"". 

One soul is equivalent to another and money matters most? What happened to the happy squirrels vibe?

This existence is pain for me, so I'm sorry if this post was hard for anyone to read, or scary, or dangerous.

But I need someone to explain to me what the fucking point is right about now. 

Why am I being detained? You have nothing to show me, I. had. everything. And I don't want it again. It hurt to lose it and I liked the one I had. God is a little too fucking giddy up there with replacing shit sometimes if you ask me.

Am I supposed to be happy even though I no longer get to be with the love of my life? Why would I keep fighting depression just for another shot at fighting depression? I'm supposed to take just money and go find someone else and just say ""this one will do then""? No one even fucking stays. I always felt that way and thought ""you're just traumatized"", but then this shit, and even if I found one fucking person to stay, great, good job me, I get to be with them until one of us inevitably dies?

I already had it all. I had everything that everyone wants. If everything is temporary I'll take my memories and leave, thanks.

Anyone who made it here, thanks for reading all that. Ftr I'm not a danger to myself (or anyone else (somewhat-obviously)) at the moment, and I have several people I can call if I'm feeling across a certain line. But I'm irritated atm that the world considers it wrong for me to leave, and I could use a non shitty reason for anything to exist in a way where nothing stays."
2558,depression,I’m so alone and my life is going nowhere.,I don’t have anyone or anything anymore. I have 1 friend (kinda) and we only occasionally talk. It never gets deep and I dont feel like I can’t go to him with my problems. I’m failing all my classes and the end of the semester is coming up in December. It’s a struggle just to keep myself living let alone keep good grades. I just don’t know what to do anymore or where to turn to anymore. I’m running out of reasons to live and reasons to care. If I died today people would only care for a month max. They would get over me quickly and live their normals lives but that’s honestly what I want. I get to end my pointless life and be forgotten while everyone gets to be happy and live theirs. It’s a win win. I don’t think I have much time left.
2559,depression,I've lost all motivation.,"it's always bad, but it's so much worse now. i don't know what to do anymore, it's my last year of high school...i have to apply to colleges and what not this month but i've lost the little motivation that i had. i let my grades drop so badly and although i have time, i can't bring myself to do anything. it takes so much out of me and i feel like shit because of it. i never thought i would make it this far, but i did...and for nothing it seems like. as of recent, i've been looking forward to going to college, i'm hoping a new setting and surrounding will make me feel a little better. but how will i get that if i cant do anything? i don't know what to do anymore and watching myself sink just makes it worse."
2560,depression,where im at in life,"hey! so lifes been fucking terrible lately so im just gonna type some of my fustrations out.

i was so fucking depressed during highschool. i would just skip days, sleep through entire classes, not do any assignments, all that hreat stuff. i thought about ending it every fucking day. after school i would go home to a super toxic household. my mom has so many mental issues and my dad gets angry at anything. i went to therapy, shit got better. i powered through senior year with a positive outlook on life for once. so covid hits and im done with highschool and i got into a pretty alright college. i was so ready to really start life. make new friends, see new places, blablabla. but it didnt turn out that way. now im here doing online school and i have never felt more alone in my life. like its genuinely painful how lonely i am. i see friends every now and then but i still feel nothing. my depression has gotten worse and so has my anxiety. life is just so terrible rn i cant even try to explain it all

stress, isolation, depression

the only times i feel at peace are when im asleep or listening to music.

besides that. life is miserable."
2561,depression,I want to die but I know I don't want to die.,"Hello. I'm 23, Asian, Female, with a Bachelor's degree that I don't need. 

Like most people, I'd like to be alive and happy because dying sounds painful and I hate pain.

But sometimes when I feel so much pain mentally and physically, I wish I could just drop dead because I can't go see a doctor or get emotional support from my family and friends.

I don't have money for doctors and I'm too afraid to talk to my family or friends. I tried before and it was either they start talking about themselves or say ""it'll pass"", ""push through"", ""everybody is having a hard time"".  It hurts that I can't just talk and someone would just listen and nod.

I know I'd do the same as my family or friends tho. I'm not a therapist.

Anyways.

I always felt alive while I draw but now it's really painful to do it. I don't know what I did to myself. I just wanted to succeed as an artist. I wanted to be noticed and loved for creating great work. Make money and show my family that artists don't become homeless. I wanted to prove to myself and others that being an artist isn't something you should constantly worry about or be told ""if you don't do what I want, I'll make you do nursing major"" or ""stop doodling and make something great"".

Now I can't even draw without feeling so rotten on the inside. Thoughts are just going on in my head.  They won't shut up. Constantly whispering, ""this'll make money"", ""this'll get lot of likes"", ""I'm such a failure"", ""I can't even draw so why try"", ""I'm not an artist. I draw for likes"", ""I should just give up"".

Only I can get myself back up but I have no motivation and have no clue on how to get motivated.

I feel like I'm losing everything. Just rotting away. I hate my family for saying those things at me. I don't care if they came from a loving place. It hurt and it sucked.

I don't trust anyone. I don't trust myself either.

And I have no idea what to do about it. I tried so many times to fix it but I failed every time.

I'm done trying. It's like swimming with a rock tied to my leg.

Life is sucks so hard. I want to die but I really don't at the same time."
2562,depression,Rant,"I want to die so, so badly. Life is just a ton of effort and suffering, sprinkled with rare happy bits here and there.

I've never actually been diagnosed by a doctor with depression but I think it's safe to assume I am very depressed. Some symptoms I've been having are of the following: Getting extremely tense and breakdown because I can't do simple tasks (I had a mental breakdown because I failed misreblely at washing a fucking cheese grater), Never want to move or get our of bed, Almost lost consciousness because I wasn't eating, Crying every day and tried to self-harm on multiple occasions with a particular serrated kitchen knife. I have no fucking idea if I do have severe depression or if anyone will read this and quite frankly I do not give a shit anymore. I'm wasting my youth with tears and soon I'm going to drown in them."
2564,depression,"I'm at the point now where when people ask me what's going on, I tell the complete unfiltered truth.","I'm exhausted. I just stopped talking to everyone. I don't even have the patience to lie anymore. In the very rare instances when people ask me how I am, I just say I'm miserable and I want to die. I'm not even joking or trying to be edgy about it. 

""No! Don't say that!""

Why not? I am miserable. I want to die. You want me to lie about it? You want me to say I'm okay? I'm not okay. Why should I tell you any different? Don't want to hear it? Don't ask. 

I feel like I'm preparing for the end. I think that I'm being very flippant about my feelings because I just care anymore. I know that this is never going to end. I know that I just have to take this all into my own hands. I know that I'm running out of time. 

""But you have so much to live for?""

Like what? Why does everyone keep lying to me about this? I have a lot to live for? Life is so wonderful? Everything will be okay? How? How on Earth is everything going to be okay? Nothing has been okay for 32 fucking years. What do I have to live for? Why don't you just tell me what it is that I have to live for? If I were hungry would you tell me about food, or would you give me something to eat? I don't need to hear that it will get better, I need it to get better. 

Sometimes I envision my anger and depression as a fire raging in my chest. I daydream that one day that fire will burst out of me and devour everything. I can see the entire world engulfed in my hatred."

2578,depression,"My parents believe depression meds and therapy is bad for you and ""for the weak"".","Ok, so I'm a 14F and I have undiagnosed depression. It has negatively affected me a lot recently because I have had to do online school where you work at your own pace and I have bad procrastination habits and I get distracted easily. Not to mention the motivation issues I have because of depression. Also the constant worry that my parents will contract the coronavirus and get very sick and/or die because the US is handling the pandemic horribly.

So about my parents... They are very religious and they believe that mental health isn't that serious of an issue. I love my parents but I am struggling everyday to the point where it affects the rest of my family (with my depression I am having problems with my sleep schedule and the amount of sleep my body craves) as well as my grades (I have gotten all A's up to this point).

My parents seem to only want to argue with me why they are right instead of actually helping me with my mental health. They have sat me down and tried to have a conversation with me about my mental health but when I share my struggles with them (which is sometimes difficult because I have a hard time explaining some things in a way that makes sense) they tell me to ""just do __, it's not that hard"" (for example, I say that I have trouble motivating myself to do things like schoolwork and they say something like ""oh, well I have to do work at my job, if I can do it you can too."" And ""motivation comes from inside you, you're just telling yourself that you aren't motivated because you want an excuse not to do it.""

(TW?) My parents also like to use mention of depression medications and therapy as a way to mock me (for example, I tell them that I am having a hard time coping with my mental health issues and they say things like ""oh, so what do you want me to do about it? Do you want drugs?"" As if depression medications aren't effective and the only reason I am bring up my depression is because I want to get addicted to drugs or something. They also strongly imply that wanting/taking depression meds is weak because other people can ""just deal with it and get back to life as normal""). Another thing that really bothers me about that is the fact that they bring it up randomly when I'm just going about my day. Like I would just be watching a movie or something with the rest of my family and the movie would mention something about mental health medications and my parents would address me in some way. Like, I'm already struggling enough with depression, I don't need everyone to point out that they think virtually the only thing that could help me is bad, especially if I was having a good time before.

They do kind of have a reason to think that depression medication is bad, though. I know a lot of my family members from my mom's side had a history of taking depression medications and seeming to lose some of their emotion. For me, though, I've had worse depressive episodes where I felt like I had no emotion, so would the medicine have any different effect? I also think that it would be more healthy in the long run to cure my depression than to have worse symptoms in the future. I mean, given the circumstances, I could be having worse effects because of the pandemic and once the pandemic is over my depression could not be as bad as it is now and I wouldn't need as much (if any) medicine anymore.

So I guess for now I'll just have to find some healing crystals that will magically take my depression away.  Either that or I will have worsening depression throughout my life as it gets more difficult to function every day until eventually I overwhelm myself to the point of not existing. If only it were that easy."

2580,depression,At this point idk what this page is I just find myself coming back during bad times,"I am actually so close to just doing it, at this point I don’t even know who I am or what I want in life , I have no personality and I’m always negative , my confidence is all fake and nothing means anything anymore , my passions have died out and I have nothing I want in life , I thought I had everything needed to get better, I thought Being successful in my career would make me happy but it hasn’t , I’m not happy and seeing that I have a good life and not feeling any of the joy makes me feel worse for being ungrateful,  “no reason” to be depressed just makes me more upset to why I feel this way"
2581,depression,I think I became dumb,"I’m 21 and suffer from depression and social anxiety. I can’t study, think critically or focus and I start losing all motivation to even try to. I have very strong issues with my concentration and memory at the moment.

I’m inarticulate when I used to be well spoken.

I don’t have opinions on certain topics. I can‘t find anything to talk about in conversations. I can‘t follow conversations because I just can‘t focus.

For the same reason I just can‘t focus in uni online classes. I‘m present all time but I don‘t remember what the docent said two seconds ago and so after classes I leave without remembering anything from it. You can imagine how this makes university and life even harder for a person that already suffers from depression and social anxiety.

Often I don‘t remember what I read in books or texts, what happened in a movie I watched, what I talked about with someone, what I experienced last day/week/month and so on.

I feel like I can’t even think anymore... like my mind is empty. I feel like I don’t know ANYTHING. It’s like I forgot everything I’ve ever learned or experienced.

I start to skip classes more often because of this adding up to my depression and social anxiety. It‘s just so incredibly hard focussing and understanding. This really fucks with my self worth and self esteem. I mean being socially anxious (not talkative, not open, asocial), depressive (low mood/anhedonic) and then dumb, too?

My brain turned completely empty, unable to function and dumb in the last time. It seems like I can‘t access my head, thoughts, knowledge or memories. I have no concentration and memory, I can‘t learn new things anymore. I read things I’m interested in and and then I forget them. And seriously how could someone develop not being able to learn?

I‘m not sure if I‘m able to complete my last two semesters of my psychology bachelor being like this. Even if I would complete it, I don‘t know in which job someone like me, a young man with depression, social anxiety and now also cognitive deficits, could work and get his job well done. Then how would I ever be able to socialize when now even my cognition lets me down. How would soneone like me ever be happy and confident or create real friendships/romantic relationships? These thoughts worsen my depression but it‘s so realistic when I stay like this, disabled.

I think having depression and anxiety for many years is the cause of my cognitive deficiency. Does/did anyone here experience similar? How can I demolish those problems? They really took the last ability I had in life as depression and social anxiety took the others..."

2586,depression,How I got depression and my Zoloft success story,"The year was 2006, and it was my 1st day in a new school. I was 8 years old and amped up and ready for my 1st day as a grade 3 student. It was an international school and I had 23 classmates. Our class teacher was a fair nice looking lady who also taught us maths. Let’s call her Miss. S. The 1st day went pretty well with the one exception of my 8 year old brain registering that Miss. S liked to have things her way and that meant I couldn’t use the addition and subtraction methods I knew, but had to follow the exact steps she taught us. I found it confusing as I already had my own way of doing it.

The nightmare that would haunt me for the rest of my life came soon afterwards. A few days after school started Miss. S asked the class about who ‘s parents complained about her to the office(the office meaning the principal and the vice principal). None of the kids responded. I think she repeated the question (it was 12 years ago my memory is not picture perfect) and when no one responded she dragged me to the front of the class BY MY EAR. I was shocked, did not understand what was going on. She accused me of complaining about her( I did not). That is all I remember from that day.

The next day onwards I didn’t want to go to school. I cried and straight up refused to get ready for school. My grandfather used to drive me and my sister to school in his van and that day my mom also came. I did not wanna go inside the school I wanted to stay in the van. Someone they coaxed me into school but all I did was hang by the gate and cry. My mom would stand outside the gate crying too not knowing what the hell was going on. There were days when I left my bag at home or didn’t properly wear my uniform. Since I refused to go to my own class I studied in my sister’s class. She was an LKG student and her teacher was so nice that she would collect my lessons from my own class and I would study them in a corner of my sister’s class.

Anyway I told my parents that I was afraid of Miss. S. They let the principal know. Mr. M , our principal who was this old gentle yet strict man is the reason I continued going to school while still crying and hanging to the gate. He bought me chocolates and peanuts and let me study in the principal’s office. Mrs.N , the vice principal was also very nice. They got the head prefect, someone much senior to me to be friends with me so having the big kids as my friends gave me a little confidence.


 However I was still crying, not eating and straight up refusing to go to school so my dad, a highly educated man took me to a counsellor. Mr.F. He had me do this meditation stuff and breathing exercises which I confess did not help me at all.  I also had OCD from birth(just some small obsessions like putting my hands in a bowl of water to fall asleep and having trouble choosing socks to wear feeling sorry for the socks left out and that kind of thing) so counseling was pretty much useless. My dad worked far from home and only came home on weekdays. Because of my condition paired with my OCD I wanted him near me always and I would scream and cry when he got ready to leave for work on Sundays(he had to leave on Sunday to be at work on Monday). I would cal him when he leaves and sometimes he would turn around and come back although he is already half way gone. They would buy me gifts and get me cakes to cut on my birthday at school. Miss. S was still my class teacher though. I guess they thought if they created happy memories around her I would start to like her. She is there near me and the cake in my school birthday celebration photos. Note that my parents did not know about the dragging me by the ear incident. It took me a long time to tell them that. 

Sometimes she forcefully kept me in class. I remember that she was pregnant. She would keep me trapped between her desk and the wall and I would try to crawl through under the desk. I would throw my shoes which sailed past my classmates heads and sometimes even hit them. By now I was the most popular kid at school. The “crying kid” they called me. Even some parents called me that. 

Eventually Miss. S left school and went to this new big school. I still don’t know if she was sacked or if she went on her own I would also like to tel that during the term I spent in my sister’s class , I still wrote the exam and got the 4th position of class. However Miss. S was the supervisor at the maths test and I wrote about half of the paper , faked a headache and spent the next hour in the sick bay as I could not stand being next to her. I still remember her smell, the smell of new born babies after they’ve had milk combined with a flowery smell . A smell I had never come across ever since yet a smell I would recognize instantly. 

My life at school became normal after that. I was a model student and I went on to become to head prefect at school and I was loved my all the teachers. I’ll be forever grateful to my principal and vice principal for being so kind to me. I remember that when I was in grade 6 a new kid who was in grade 1 cried in class daily and the principal had me talk to her. Fortunately that kid just missed her mom and was not bullied in any way.

So today, 12 years later I was talking with my grade 3 classmate who I was with for a few months before she left to another school. She brought up my crying incident and I told her about the Miss. S ordeal and she was shocked. She never knew the for my crying because she left school soon afterwards but apparently she was also bullied by Miss. S. In 2 different schools which she left because of her only to see that Miss. S was in the 3rd school too. And that’s how I got to know that Miss S didn’t just ruin my childhood but my friend’s and also get this, she bullied 2 other kids I know! I will let them tell their own story. This is my story. Bullying is NOT okay. It hurts my heart to know that other people went through such a painful time because of 1 rogue teacher. She was sacked from the last school she taught in and eventually migrated and lives in Canada with her husband and daughter now. I wanted to tell this story because I cannot stand knowing there are other kids going through the same rough patch as I did. So if you know anyone who is going through or went through a similar situation please ask them to talk. Parents please make sure to look into your kids. They might be going through a traumatic experience that will stay with them for the rest of their lives. 

I still have depression. I have been on Zoloft for a long time. It is all under control now. What I wanted to say is please pay attention to your kids or colleagues. They might be going through a lot."
2587,depression,Feelin pretty worthless," I feel like I'm not worth anything. I'm just someone who exists and wastes space. Tried to talk about a shit day and got some half assed response that didn't help. I told them thank you but I don't need that kind of support rn. Then got jumped from every angle. Now I just feel like I'm some ungrateful asshole who really is more a waste of space. I don't even know what I'm typing I'm just rambling stupid shit but needed to get stuff off my chest.

I'm always in the middle of family drama, being dragged from one side to the other and then just trying to be supportive for everyone while struggling to even help myself.

Depression has literally taken over my life, constantly stressed about family, money, no ability to hold down a job, being on the verge of being homeless and other things that I'm not even prepared to talk about or deal with. 
Not to mention I've been neglecting my physical health for years now, let alone my mental health. 

I just feel like I'm stuck in a few fucked up situations with hardly any way out. 
Honestly I don't think I'm here for advice because I know what I should do, it's just finding the motivation to do it and putting the time in. 
I think I just needed to vent a little.

2604,depression,Idk man,"I’m here on reddit cuz I’m tired of bugging my friends with my problems :/ Im 19F I struggle w depression,anxiety, social anxiety and bpd. I’m pretty good at masking the symptoms of my illness when I need to but I’m mostly just numb to them now to cope. Beginning of summer was great. But then my friends made new friends and yea I try and force myself to like them so I don’t feel alone but I’m tired of pretending. I got left in the dust... So I’ve been distancing. Isolating. My friends don’t seem to care, my dad doesn’t notice(he wouldn’t notice if a brick hit him). I just take benzos to numb myself even more. Like I get why I have no friends. I used to have so many but that’s when I was just a party girl and I’m not like that anymore because I got sober for senior year and lost all my “friends”. I can’t date people because I just don’t feel anything, anything I don’t even get horny I’m so dead inside. Ik this is all my fault. Self medicating pushing people away and being a controlling freak when I feel I’m being abandoned. I’m just so tired. I’m giving up. I just want it to end. I don’t see that light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I thought getting sober (something I never thought I’d do) would save me. It didn’t. now I’m just alone. Ik Ik “find sober friends” easier said than done, I’m not really a approachable person girls tend to think I’m a bitch and guys only want one thing, even as friends. I’m just so lost. I miss having a group of friends and being invited to things and feeling loved. But I feel nothing. I hear death whispering my name so often. The voice in my head is growing louder and louder saying I’m worthless and “no wonder you don’t have friends u don’t even want to be alive”. I just hope my 3 friends are happy without me (which Ik they are) (they only hang to pity me) they deserve to be. My dads a douche so he can rot in hell and I have no other family so. Not much to live for anymore. Killing yourself is so hard tho even when I was deep in addiction and prayed to die in between fleeting moments of consciousness I never did. So now Ik how hard it will be when the day comes that I snap. I really just want to go man. I’m so tired of pretending to be ok, fuck that I don’t even pretend. NO ONE CARES and I don’t either I’ll be gone before the end of the year I have a deep gut feeling. I’m tired of being used and thrown away like I’m nothing when I’d cross oceans for people I love. Fuck everything man I wasn’t made for this world it would be better without me :("
2605,depression,Kitten passed away.,"Trigger warning.

I broke up with my boyfriend (we’ll call him A) 3 weeks ago. Still very attached and a few days before the accident I was thinking of telling him I wanted to make it work. But I figured it’d be good if we both took some time for ourselves. He invited me to lunch for last Sunday, and I initially said yes but I was still anxious so a changed my mind. He was understanding and said it would be good if we took time apart. 

Sunday came, the day we were supposed to hang out. He called me unexpectedly. He was sobbing. I’ve never heard so much agony in his voice. The kitten we had raised together got run over and he wanted to let me know. He was going to bury him right after the call. I was in shock. I asked him to come over or for me to go with him but he refused. He went on his own. After he hung up is when it hit me that our kitten died. 

After the call he turned his phone off and didn’t tell me where he was going. He had been saying some suicidal stuff and drinking heavily because of the breakup. so I was worried for him. I called his mom and asked if she knew where he went. She didn’t know, but told me to call her if he responded.

I asked her what happened to our kitty. And she told me all the details, and the image is haunting me. The kitty was only 16 weeks old so he was a tiny guy. He got out of the house and went across the street, and when the mom went to look for him he ran back towards the house as a car was coming. His little body was flattened. She described to me how his body looked. I won’t go into the details, but just hearing about it traumatized me a little. 

She went inside to grab a bag to pick him up and that’s when she told A what happened to the kitten. He was in shock at first, but then he took the bag and went to pick the kitten up himself. I can’t imagine how he felt in that moment and that’s what hurts me the most. His biggest fear has always been losing a pet. He had a kitten 3 years ago that passed away from poisoning and he had to watch as the kitten seized up and screamed. He had to put that kitten down and it took him a long time to heal. He also raised that one from the beginning and it was just a kitten when it died too. The last cat we got last may ran away, but we weren’t too attached to her. Now this happened. We were so so attached to this little guy, very committed to his care. We were looking forward to watching him grow up. He were so in love with him. 

He literally watched his biggest nightmare come true. He had to see the kitten. He had to bury him. And now that we’re broken up he’s going through it alone. I so badly wish I could be there for him.

He called me back once he finished burying the kitten. His mom told him I was worried so he wanted to let me know he’s going home. I told him I really wanted to be there for him, that I needed him, that I had been wanting to talk about getting back together and that I still cared about it. He didn’t want to hear it, it was too much for him at the moment. He was upset. He said if I wanted to talk to him I should have said something earlier, and that he needed space. He texted me afterwards saying he didn’t mean to be rude and he was going back home. I told him to be safe and he never responded. 

This happened this past Sunday. I keep imagining his reaction to what happened, the pain he felt, I imagine the kitten because of how his mom described it to me. I’m angry at myself for being so selfish to bring our relationship up after that happened. I can’t stop worrying about him. I feel like I can’t breathe. I want to text him, but I also want to respect his space. It’s just so hard I miss him so much and I’m so sad. I’m angry at the world. Angry that the kitten had to die, angry at myself for causing A pain in the first place. If I had gone to hang out with A this probably wouldn’t have happened. We would be happy. 

The only comfort I can give myself is that he’ll talk to me eventually. But what if he doesn’t? What if this time he realizes he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore? My heart aches unbearably. 

I have a therapist I talk to. But I don’t see her until next Thursday, and at this point I’m struggling to keep going everyday. I lost my faith in god. I was never one to follow the church, but I always had hope that someone out there was controlling everything. There’s no way god did this to teach us a lesson. So many terrible things happen in this world. 

I can’t sleep. I can’t stop imagining the kitten and the pain that A must have felt. I go from not having an appetite and forcing myself to eat to bingeing on food just to feel something different. 

All I ask for is encouragement. Maybe someone can relate to losing a pet, or seeing a loved one in pain, or having second hand trauma, or feeling so sad you can’t breathe. I just want to feel like someone understands me. 

Thank you to whoever read. I hope this wasn’t too confusing."

Besides, even if I did it’s not like I hadn’t tried before. When I was 7, after a solid 2 years after beginning to absolutely hate myself, I asked for help. I was just pushed away, I had the phrase “You aren’t depressed, kids don’t get depressed.” thrown at me.

What do you think, should I try again? Should I open my heart to my own parents just to get it shattered again?"
2622,depression,Help for a friend who's depressed(SERIOUS),"Sorry english is not my primary language :(

My friend 35(F) is severely depressed and and at times she's a bit suicidal.

To begin with she's a victim of physical, mental and emotional abuse starting in her late teens, kicked from home when she was 16 survived on her own by doing medium wage jobs, working late, pull in favours. There's no parental love, no partner/spouse/boyfriend in her life. She used to have boyfriends but they either cheated or abused her. She has no degree/diploma to her name, wants to study law (wants to be a human right activist or some sort of environmentalist) but realising that it will take 5 years and will cost a lot of money &amp; she will be in her 40s by the end of it  plus the fact that young people are always preferred first in job applications. That idea is also losing it's value. Every time i tell her to study for it she gets emotional and starts crying because this opportunity was denied to her in her 20s and the trauma that comes from thinking about it. For the past 4-5 yrs she has been living with her parents after not seeing them for more than a decade there's almost always fights and arguments which end with her crying to bed because she feels like her life is done and everything's over. 

I don't know what comforting words i could possibly say to save her every day feels like a spiral and a loop."

2624,depression,I’m tired and simple,[removed]
2625,depression,what should i do?,"i’m not happy and i’m tired of living like that. if i’m not happy now i will never have the chance to succeed in life for my future. even my family says so. i just wanna die now i have horrible luck, no one likes me/loves me what’s the point in all of this"
2626,depression,I’m scared of what could happen,I’m mentally strong I’ve seen a lot been through a lot but watching a girl take my newborn son away and not letting me see him and saying it’s easier this way but she doesn’t understand that I love my little baby boy I wanna see him everyday I wanna hold him and make sure that he’s always alright but I feel like she doesn’t want me to be there for him she wants me to leave so she has an excuse to tell everyone she blocks me on social media and blocked my family everyone tells me they see her with another guy already I don’t know what to do I just want my baby boy 😔
2627,depression,I wish everyone hated me so I could have a reason to kill myself.,"but they don’t. I tried so hard to push people away and isolate myself because they are the last real obstacle in my way, but instead they all came together to talk about how much they ‘cared about me.’ This is not what I wanted. I wanted everyone to hate me so they would be happy when I was gone. why can’t they just let me have this? Why can’t they just let me leave? I fucking hate everyone and everything...but I hate myself most of all. Everything that’s wrong in my life is because of me, but I’d rather die like a pathetic piece of human garbage than fix it all because I’m literal trash. I’m trash. Fuck everything."
2628,depression,Is it possible to be content?,"I often catch myself repeating negative phrases about myself, like ""I'm a piece of shit, I want to die"" etc. But sometimes, those are more conditional phrases, ""someday, I'll be happy."" ""If I do X and Y, I'll be happy"" but I'm afraid that even if X and Y do happen, I'll be waiting for Z.

Is contentment an illusion? Is it even possible to be a generally happy person?"
2629,depression,Is there something wrong with me that makes me unlikeable?,"Sometimes I wonder if I’m even thought of by other people, do they think about me as much as I think about them. Do they think about me and then exclude me or do just not think about me at all? Like am I a thought in their head when their choosing who to invite to parties, who to drink with, who to hang out with.

I’ve heard so many empty promises from my friends “bro you don’t get out enough I’ll invite u over sometime” “oh you’ve never been to a party I’ll invite you to one”. I mean the opportunity has come up several times, and I know you’re doin what you said you’d do with me just without me. 

Maybe they think I wouldn’t enjoy parties and alcohol because I haven’t done any of that shit before, so they exclude me purposely because they think I’d have more fun that way, despite showing interest on several occasions.

I just can’t tell if I’m unlikeable because I’ve been told I’m not on several times but also I never get invited to anything, and sometimes it’s rubbed in my face that I’m excluded all the time.

Maybe I’m overthinking"
2630,depression,I feel like I’m being discriminated against for my mental health sometimes on reddit,[removed]
2631,depression,i feel happy?,"ok i’ve been depressed for a really long time now, it was pretty bad. but ever since yesterday i’ve felt super happy and energetic, i cleaned my nasty room, washed all my clothes and a bunch of other stuff. food is even tasting better now. idk what’s going on, if anyone knows what happening please comment thx."
2632,depression,I dont have anyone,"My only friend online doesn't want to talk to me anymore. They're running out of compassion and they just can't deal with it anymore so they're cutting me off. I don't blame them. I try to keep my issues and emotions to myself as much as I can but it was still too much. I tried to beg and grovel for them to stay but it wasn't enough. 

They meant a lot to me and now they gone for good, just like that. No closure. 
I don't have anyone now.
I've been crying for hours now. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I ruin everything I touch. My life is a total joke."
2633,depression,I’d prefer to bear the pain everyone faces,"I sit here writing this, and it’s not a suicide note... surprisingly. That was supposed to be last week. It’s not a fuck you, get over it. Many people have spoken those words as “treatment”. It’s not an I can save you. Lord willing I would, but I absolutely cannot... not because I don’t want to, but everything to do with I can’t choose what you do. All I can help with is taking the hurt and pain I feel and try to facilitate to the best of my ability a way for me to make it more clear to you that living depressed is a lot better than not living at all.
I write this on a not so great night, from a dark and melodic place where the harmonies of depression bounce around.... constantly singing their tunes of sorrow in my head. 
My one wish in this lifetime... to be allowed to take your pain away. Take whatever has hurt you and wear it myself like a plate of armor. I wish to the god, gods, universe, I could take what you have for myself and leave you free to live. Most would say you wouldn’t truly take that. The thing is I undoubtedly would, no questions asked. I cried tonight not from my own depression, but from reading all your posts on this sub and realizing how widespread depression is. I want you to be GOOD. I want you to LIVE. I want you to have a FAMILY. I want you HAPPY. I don’t need to know you because I already do, we’re all the same. 
I wish I didn’t have to lean half my body over a bridge last week, just to feel like I was finally alive. But in an instant if I had a chance.... just know I would choose to bear the pain of the world, and suffer myself so that you could all lead beautiful lives. That would make me feel more whole than anything else in this world could.
I have nothing but love for all of you ❤️ 
My hope in you reading this is you realize I don’t need to know you for you to feel like I care. My tears from commenting on ‘strangers’ posts to try and help should suffice as enough evidence. It kills me to know how many of your are hurting. I wish upon no one. And I only wish I could take it for you.
Please, even on your worst day, do not take that last breath from your own hand. Fight with me. Live with me. Grow with me. And I can promise you, you will realize if you keep going that you are worth more than the universe holds. You are unique, special, goofy, most importantly loved. DONT YOU EVER FUCKING DO IT."
2634,depression,I want to support you,"Im batteling depression, have been for 5 years, monthly therepy sessions... but some days nothing helps, and suicidal thoughts are the second worst, worst is homisidal thoughts about my children...

Some days i just want to leave everything and start again... no one know this side of me, even my wife just knows im depressed, she has no idea how far dowm this rabbit hole goes...

I find talking to people who understand is a powerful tool, to actually be acknoledged, it helps alot.

If youre ever at the edge reach out to a stranger, its alot easier than showing this to people who know you, also you never have to talk to that person again if you dont want to...

If you need me im here"
2635,depression,im considering killing myself soon,its just too much anymore and im thinking ill be better off dead
2636,depression,I was so close to telling a close friend how I feel.. and I couldn’t do it,"I’ve been depressed for a long time and I’ve never confessed it to anyone. Today, I feel that I finally built up the strength to do it and I couldn’t. Am I wrong for hiding it? Is there an easy way to tell someone what you’re going through? I need help but I don’t know what to do. Thankfully, I’ve never experienced any dark thoughts, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t feel worthless. I wish this was something easy"

2638,depression,My father finally accepts that I have the big sad.,"After hiding my growing depression and anxiety till I was 18 and technically not my parents problem it took only two more years to tell my mom how unbearably sad I am for no reason. She accepted it very quickly but my father has been telling me “depression is like the flu you’ll get over it eventually” all my life till I realized that I am in it for the long haul all the way to the grave because as a catholic I am too fearful to off myself (my mother is happy to hear that). Three nights ago after talking to my father in person, he went hope and told my mother “so she’s sick..” apparently sounding so lost. Of course he went through the stages of grief and questioned whether he took part. (A bit but overall a good father and would absolutely devastated if I said he contributed in comparison to my mother who will take what I say and accept it with a “who cares” attitude”). I am joining this sub officially today and literally they are the only two people in my life who I believe care about as I have absolutely devastated myself because I am incapable of maintaining  any relationship. Texting gives me so much anxiety and I let messages sit and then time just passes and I open it or don’t reply. Well that’s the tip of the ice berg but at least my father will finally accept this part of me. It feels okay to be seen I guess."
2639,depression,"I can't live with this thought, I feel sick."," During last summer, I developed a sense of high anxiety around being in the company of young people/babies that I'd never had prior. This was a result of feeling intense distress over finding out that an ex teacher was a pedophile. I came to realize in March this year through research that this is called POCD, which provided me with a lot of relief.

In the late evening of Monday, 23rd September 2019 after having moved back into university halls of residence for my second year a week prior, I basically watched pornography for around about 2-4 hours intermittently when my depression was as its worst height. I'd already experienced false memories by this point.

Anyway, for that whole afternoon and night, I would go from grinding/humping against the bed (an awkward way of doing it that I developed when I was in my early teens) while watching Porn Hub on my phone, to then sitting up and watching random videos on YouTube.

The second to last video I watched was a video of Kurt Cobain and his 2 year old daughter, that appeared on the homepage after going back from Porn Hub and sitting up in bed again. At this point, I remember thinking that if I were to watch this video, I shouldn't watch another video afterwards, purely ''because this YouTube video had a baby in it'' - even though I knew deep down that the two videos were entirely separated by tabs on my phone, not to mention obviously by content. Nevertheless, I watched the interview video, scrolled through the comments and paused at a specific point then went back to Porn Hub, and only then did I kneel down to grind the duvet again, but with a video loaded.

Finally, I remember sitting up again and going back to the YouTube homepage and the first video shown was a slideshow of Cobain's daughter through the years and I remember feeling so much guilt for having watched the prior porn. The reason for this is that - as best as I can describe - seeing her (as a baby, the pinnacle of innocence) exemplified the essential humanity that we all have, including the adult performers. As a result, I felt heavy guilt (that I now realize to be misplaced) for being what I considered to be ''anti-feminist'', and an ''evil person''.

Perhaps I overthink the morality of things, I don't know.

My brain at the time immediately started to go into overload and overlap what would otherwise be two separate actions of watching YouTube then lewd stuff. I remember going to the sink afterwards, and dry-vomiting.

With regards to the actual first-person recollection of possibly staring at the Cobain video, I have no explicit sensory memory of this. The 'image' in my head is grainy at best. I wouldn't have been able to live with myself were this the opposite.

After leaving the bathroom and panicking a lot, I walked through it step-by-step, and eventually felt comfortable enough that I hadn’t done anything wrong and so I left it. This, as a general worry didn't reappear again till May 2020, with the rest of 2019 being spent going from day-to-day worries and false memories. I even felt happy and content on New Year's Day this year.

Surely, if I'd done this horrible thing, I wouldn't have been able to feel anything happy ever again?

At first, I wondered if I did do it, and I just repressed it, or I didn’t and actually it’s just my overactive imagination mixed with my anxiety. I know that in my heart I didn’t do anything wrong, as I had listened to Nirvana plenty of times afterwards, and didn’t feel pangs of guilt or shame that I know I would’ve if I’d done anything wrong.

Things have gotten better mildly. My first appointment with an OCD therapist is soon. I'm currently on the fourth day of taking a beta-blocker to regulate my heart-rate and blood pressure that helps ward off the panic attacks I have about it. I'm trying to sleep better, but sometimes the image creeps in too much. I'm due to get a new set of the anti-depressant mirtazipine soon, too.

But even with that, it all feels like too much right now and I'm more suicidal than ever about this. I don't want to die over an image in my head, but is this a belated guilty conscience? I feel sick and can't think or sleep. I have moments of 'you know you're being silly, start living again', but then it hits my head over and and I end up in bed depressed for another week.

I worry that I might, out of a morbid curiosity, have done it. I remember faintly thinking how awful it would be to do it, and then - as far as I know - not doing it."
2640,depression,"No, I wont tell you to get over it...",[removed]
2641,depression,My biggest insecurity is being second choice.,"It always has been. And I’ve always been exactly that. I always try to put my friend’s happiness over mine, but in the end I will still be the partner-less one when there’s an odd number of people at an amusement park, I will still be the one who is only invited because someone else dropped out last minute, I will still be the third best friend, the one who walks behind them when there’s no room on the sidewalk, I will still be the person who no one checks up on unless I reach out first, I will still be the person who gives and gives and I don’t expect much but a damn “How are you doing?” once in a while when you asked and I told you I was suicidal again would suffice.

I’m just asking for once, I want to be someone’s first choice. I want to someone to reach out first. I want someone to care about how I’m doing and mean it.

All my life, even after my diagnosis, they all said I was suicidal for attention. Is that so wrong that I want someone to at least care a little bit? Is it so wrong that I’m still clinging to the last bit of hope that someone, just one person, would care enough if I was gone? 

In the end, everyone will have someone if I’m gone. They won’t be partner-less at the amusement park, they won’t walk behind one another but besides one another on the sidewalks, they will have people to check up on them if they’re sad, if they were drowning they’d have a hand to lift them up. I’m not needed. I’m only, ever will be, the second choice."
2642,depression,i just want to die,"this is like the 3rd consecutive year i'm studying for my exams since i failed and had to retake. it's been tough. i initially had friends who would study with me but they all moved on to uni while i'm still here fucking struggling. now i'm just all alone. constantly waking up with a panic attack. and before anyone says ""just exercise! meditate!"" i am on SSRI and lift twice a week. the anxiety doesn't get better. the depression doesn't go away. i'm so old already and will probably be about late 20s when i graduate. just so depressed. i also don't know how i'll be able to fund university since i don't think i'm eligible for scholarships (shit grades no extracurriculars)"
2643,depression,When I was young I said I would kill myself this year...,I vividly remember being in 5th grade just sitting in class. Not sad at that  but not satisfied. I couldn’t see the light at the end of the tunnel so I gave myself an ultimatum. A little fat boy. And promising myself that if I wasn’t satisfied with life by 10th grade I would kill myself... I was serious but hopeful I’m 5 days from my first day of sophomore year. I’ve lost some weight gained some good friends and have a proper support system. I was righting this because I was gonna consider honoring my promise to myself but though I’m nowhere near where I want to be I’m no longer that boy. that being said give yourself time to grow don’t be hard on yourself just live let the river of life sweep you in its currents and take you to your next destination in life.
2644,depression,Don't know,I don't know what's up with me. One part of me feels like I am just making things up just to ruin my time I have got while the other half just wants to stop living. I have been considering booking a session with a therapist for almost 4 months now but feel like they are going to not be worthwhile.
2645,depression,Zone out a lot and hardly have any real emotions,Sometimes I just feel like I am just zoned out most of the time and just mellow toned when I talk I don’t really have many emotions atm just fake ones that I put on when I am around people when I get back home I am tired of being around people of having to talk to people if I don’t have to go anywhere I sleep half my day away because it’s the time I can get away from my self.
2646,depression,Depression and tattoos,"Sounds weird right, i have a few tattoos and they all have meaning... im currently thinking of more designs i cant aford, depressing enough right? But being in the midsts of a depression i cant feel passionate about anything, everything  is just meh...

Also ive been thinking of getting an armour plate tattoo... scratched and beaten... what are your ideas?"
2647,depression,Just trying to enjoy my life,"I don’t know what to do besides try to enjoy the present moment. What do I do after that? Don’t know exactly how long I’ve been feeling like this but I haven’t figured it out. I guess the answer is to try to make it out the other end with a good job, social life, e.t.c. I wish I could care, I really do. I’m tired of half-assing things and I’ve turned into a lazy person. It’s probably going to make me fall behind but there’s nothing that feels worth pushing forward for. Aside from the fear of things worsening because I already have trouble living myself without any problems. And suicide is hard, I used to be pretty serious about it a year or two back. I can’t imagine another year like that without having the strength to finish it."
2648,depression,I wish I would have the strength to reach out (again),"Around this time last year I changed schools, I didn’t even manage to attend the first lesson because of my anxiety disorder. I went to two Psychiatrists and even they stated that I’m pretty hopeless. I didn’t want to go into stationary treatment or take meds but now I don’t even care anymore. I also told my friends about it and they were fairly supportive but it seems like everyone forgot and I’m way too afraid to bring it up when I feel down. Ok two of them definitely did not forget but every time someone brings it up I get really defensive or try to deflect, even though I would love to talk about my problems. I also never find the right words or know what to say, even if I could find the right words, what would be the point in talking? I’m most likely won’t change, I can tell myself three billion times that I will seek help or try something but in the end I probably won’t because I couldn’t find the strength because I think that everything is already hopeless. It’s a never ending cicle and I wish could break it somehow."
2649,depression,[19F] I've messed up horrendously and I've absolutely no idea what to do.,"I knew as soon as I completed compulsory education that I didn't want to attend university. Having said that, I made the mistake of applying and of following through before the very last minute. Come August last year, I called up my choice, told them I was no longer interested, and told myself I'd get work experience under my belt.

Skip a year and here I am: still depressed, unemployed, suicidal, an anxious wreck. The list goes on. I'm terrible at functioning. The worst part is, I repeated my past mistake and decided to re-apply, thinking that if I tried hard enough to convince myself, I'd actually want to go, somehow persuading myself prospects would be better with a degree. At times it seemed all well and good — independence from parents, socialising with new, different people, joining societies etc, etc. But, yet again, just two weeks before I'm supposed to be going, I've suffered a massive nervous breakdown and have admitted to my mum that despite everything I'd already invested, I don't want to go. Needless to say, I've disappointed her, and rightly so. 

And I don't. Genuinely. But somewhere in my mind, and I apologise for how obnoxious this may sound, I've got this idea stuck that without a degree, I'm completely and utterly fucked — and that I'll be spending the entirety of my life stuck in full-time minimum wage work. And for those who do it and love it, massive kudos to them — but the thought of spending another sixty odd years just working full-time, it makes me want to die. Genuinely. 

Every time an opportunity comes along, I self-sabotage and I've absolutely no idea why. I become anxious and quit before I've the chance to either try it or get used to it. I'm not saying this in regards to university, but anything. And I keep catastrophising that I'll be 26-years-old and still living with my parents, still unemployed, and eventually they'll get sick of my shit and kick me out.

I just don't know what's wrong with me. I'm so incredibly scared. I'm stuck in a slump and it just keeps getting worse, and worse. I've absolutely no passion in anything whatsoever — at least no passions I can turn into a career without a degree, damn it. I feel so dysfunctional. I've tried going to my GP multiple times but they've been of little help, ever. I've so many gaps in my CV that I doubt any hiring managers will want me. Plus, there's a whole damn pandemic out there, and we're on the brink of economic recession.

I genuinely struggle to see myself in five years' time. I feel so dumb, incapable, and inferior. I genuinely keep thinking about ending my life. I'll try to go to the doctors on Monday and sign on to receive unemployed payment, but that's all I can do for now. Pales in comparison to what my sisters have achieved. 

I'm such a damn failure."
2650,depression,Should I see a therapist again?,"
I [25F] have been diagnosed with depression, depersonalization/derealization in the past. I think I've been depressed most of my adult life but did not get diagnosed till I was 21. I took therapy for 1.5 years, was put on medication. It helped a great deal and I am off them since December 2019. 

Lately I have been under a lot of stress from work. To make it worse, I have been making a lot of mistakes and the quality of my work is suffering greatly (I am not sure it's because of the stress or I'm just not doing my bit properly). I have suicidal thoughts once in a while, especially after I fuck up my work. I have been depersonalized most of the time. I feel paranoid that someone is going to hack me to death (doesn't happen very often). 

But the worst part is that whenever I think of work I get extremely nervous. I have tingling sensation in my hands and feet. It's difficult getting out of the bed in the morning but I can't stay in bed either because my heart palpitations do not let me sleep. When I decided to take a week off work, I just couldn't relax and ended up working to avoid the tingling and palpitations. I cannot sleep till I tire myself out by watching/reading. 

I am certain that I have made it sound worse than it actually is. I don't feel depressed as much as I used to 2-3 years ago. Back then I wouldn't have been able to get out of bed, least do any kind of work. I am not sure if it's worth going to a therapist. I contacted my old therapist but she forgot to give an appointment, I guess. I am in my hometown for another month, so I'll have to discontinue meetings after I move back to where I work. 

Any advice?"

2652,depression,I can’t think of a good title,"I don’t really talk about my feelings that much so this is weird for me, but fuck it. All my life I’ve been an isolated nerd that can’t muster a good conversation with anyone other than my immediate family or fellow outcasts. About three years ago in high school I met the most amazing girl ever. She reached out to me all the time and thought of me as a real friend. This was around the time that I seriously contemplated suicide and wrote up plans to go through with it, so this phase in my life came as a shock to me. The entire time that I knew her I was always super respectful as I usually am, but I always had an issue of showing no emotion or making any interesting conversation around her. The best way I could describe it is when you’re taking a history test and when you have to remember something but your mind is completely blank. I had this same experience for the 2 years that I’ve known her. She was supposed to be so easy to talk to man. We had similar interests and hobbys in video games and our life goals. But I couldn’t even talk to somebody like her like a regular fucking person. I haven’t seen her since I graduated high school, and I thought to myself that there is more fish in the water, so I kept on trying to meet new people in college, but it was the same shit as before, no development of interesting conversation or many friendships. I honestly don’t know what’s wrong with me, as I’ve even tried losing weight to fix my social issues, but still nothing. The only option I really have now is blowing my fucking brains out cause I know I can’t be happy. Once I get my own place and after I secured my parents’ future I’m gonna buy a shotgun and wait, since i cry myself to sleep at least 5/7 days a week so it’d only be a matter of time before I muster the courage to do it.

It just results in me getting hurt and them blocking me and refusing to bother with me thinking i'm a smart ass. I had to block a guy from another sub for doing this to me. Again, I got hurt out of it. A lot of folks have written me off as a lost cause and it just makes me even more sadder than I am.

I've contemplated waiting until the end of this year but I don't know if there is any justification for waiting that long. I am estranged from my family and living in a home by the grace of a roommate who resents me. I don't leave this room except to go shopping. My legs don't work as well as they used to. Nothing does. Life is hell. I regularly hope to die in my sleep."
2657,depression,Dad doesn’t care,My dad kept screaming at me today that the only reason I’m depressed is because I’m not doing normal teens things like going to school and then kept telling me all my issue is i worry about everyone else’s life white trying to explain to him that i was extremely unwell and mentally ill and have been in isolation for 4 yrs kept saying no it’s because your not in school .. and saying i don’t want to go outside and be with other teens because I’m not in school but it’s more of if I’m mentally ill and he won’t listen then i snapped and told him one tramatic experience that happened where i was drugged and sexually assaulted and that i told him this 2 yrs ago and he said no but i remember my mother being on the phone with his girlfriend bc i think she was shit talking me in messaging telling me there’s nothing wrong with me 2 yrs ago and then she said oh she remembered but “i didn’t say i was drugged “ !??? So yeah what’s the fucking difference if i was drugged or not i also was sexually assaulted the year before that in school!! And she tried saying oh no i thought you were talking about while trying to save her ass when i know i didn’t talk about that incident when i snapped 2 yrs ago then told me my drugged up story wasn’t making sense the “gf”... and kept asking me questions and told me omg why didn’t you tell anyone ?? Why didn’t you call the cops maybe because i don’t remember ?? Maybe cause the last time cops were called nothing fucking happened ?  But yeah when i snapped and said about that he said you want to tell me this now ??? Something from fucking 7th grade ??? You know what I DONT FEEL BAD ! I DONT GIVE A DAMN ! I felt like i had my heart ripped out of my chest i have been trying so hard this year to have my mind in a different mindset i feel halfway healed i just need to go to get treatment then my father kept going about how i need to get over everything and move on with life with not understanding my mentally ill in the head and then said the reason i have been going to the doctor for my headaches is to find a excuse ?? A excuse for what.. ? He told me so much other shit today that hurt me so bad i got told multiple times that I’m just fucking lazy oh yeah he’s also a alcoholic when he dropped me back off at home i couldn’t hold in the screaming anymore and started screaming that i can’t do it no more and that i need to go to the doctor now and i couldn’t stop saying that i have been crying on and off for 8 hours i was so pose to be in the physc ward in 2018 but didn’t stay bc i was scared they were gonna make me take pills since my aunts are herion addicts but now i understand antidepressants i also been trying to do something productive i have suicidal thoughts everyday i don’t act upon them i only tried 3 times i think about it a lot though but i have come to the conclusion i can’t leave my mother with that pain knowing my brother has autism i would just make the family shatter i been wanting help all year but I’m tired all the time and never end up leaving then i overthink i feel me being anonymous on here i can vent but face to face with some random stranger makes me nervous

2660,depression,"September, 05. 2020.","*Diary Entry: Rainy Days*

Woke up on Friday with suicidal thoughts. Had a nightmare on Thursday. Had anxiety last night. Woke up depressed on Wednesday. 

It’s Saturday and things are so... blurry. I wonder if there’s ever any end to my mental sufferings. I feel so lost in life, in my journey. I feel tired all the time. 

I’m really struggling with suicidal thoughts right now. I want to end my life, and not continue this endless self-disappointment, imperfection and struggles. These pointless fantasies of having a great life. Anxieties. These mini-heartbreaks. These resentment, anger and envy I don’t even know where to direct. 

Whatever I will do will not fit into the narrative I love and perfect picture continuation of the story. Whatever I do will disappoint me. I will continue being hit by life and myself, again and again.

So why can’t I just finish it?

How easy would it be. These thoughts are obsessively rolling in my head like old cinema tapes. I know life is all about misery but I can’t endure it. I am indeed really weak, not tough enough, I’m sensitive. I’m a snowflake. 

No matter how productively and perfectly I finish my schedule, I still get no satisfaction to its fullest. 

I don’t love myself, I bore myself. I think no man should love me either. There’s nothing good about me and if a man loved me, he’d be fooling himself. And how can I let my lover be dishonest to himself? It’s the best if I just die alone and not bother anyone, not even the nurses should bother with me. 

I want some peace of mind. 

I really envy people who just... exist. Have no thoughts, heavy ideas, have no crazy ambitions they can never realistically achieve that hurts them, have no anxieties, or a tyrannical figure in their heads telling them every single thing they do is not enough. 

Every time I think about suicide, I disappoint myself. I feel like all the growth and progress I’ve made since my last suicide attempt with my mental health is lost. I feel like I betrayed myself again and again. 

Then, when I feel good, something in the back of my head tells me this happy moment doesn’t matter because I will have suicidal thoughts again. 

I have no friends. I feel so lonely.

I love to assume that I don’t have social circles because I’m quiet and introverted. 

Maybe at the end of the day I just have a really shitty personality that nobody wants to deal with. 

It’s honestly surprising how good I am at keeping my composure when I feel like breaking down and cry out loud in public. I always suck it up. I always carry myself elegantly, very calm, very ladylike, and wait until I get home. 

I really fucking despise myself. I hate the way I look, the way I sing, the way I dance, I hate the way my voice sounds, I hate my heavy ambitions, I hate my dreams that don’t let me live in peace, I hate the way I dress, I hate my habits. I hate the way food tastes. I hate the way my stomach rolls when I sit down. I hate the way my chin doubles when I lay down. I hate the way my eyes get puffy in the morning. 

Most importantly, I hate how complex I am. My personality, my thoughts, my mind, they are too hard to understand, too hard to analyze. It I was another person watching me from external world, I would never deal with me. Too much labour. Too much hard work. And joke’s on me for dreaming about a man I can bond with and call my soulmate. No person would ever want to deal with a woman whose mind is as heavy as an airport baggage. 

Honestly, if a car hit me, I would thank the driver.  I hope someone accidentally runs over me today. 

Oh, wait. I don’t even go outside my house anymore. No drunk drivers for me. 

I feel like there’s a big authoritarian, abusive tyrant in my head that makes me write those awful things about myself, the very tyrant that makes me do the greatest things in my life, overpushing myself, allowing me reach the perfection, the same tyrant that inspires me to do great art is the same tyrant that pushes me closer to suicide. If I didn’t have this tyrant, I’d be happy, but I would also be absolutely untalented. 

I understand Kanye West so much when he said when he takes his meds, he can’t be creative. When he said his mind is in genius mode when he’s depressed. 

I think artistic people are born to suffer. 

It’s not that artists do art, therefore suffer. It’s that those people suffer, they cope by doing art, then become masters in their craftsmanship, then become great artists as a consequence. 

Great artists suffered long time before their first artistic debuts. 

It is so tempting. If I had to describe my suicidal thoughts, it’d be like putting a cheesecake in front a of a girl who has been dieting for months. She knows she needs to stay on diet, she knows she should not give in, otherwise what’s the point of all of this? But it’s still so tempting and she salivates, because it would be something that relieves her. And it’s so painful to watch the cheesecake and hope that hunger will ease down a little bit. But once she gives in, the diet is over. Diet symbolizing life and the cheesecake being death. 

I am the starving girl on diet right now. 

If I had to describe my depressing thoughts, It would be “sounds very irrational, but feels very convincing.” Because I know, I KNOW how irrational they are. I know they are probably not true. But it JUST feels convincing. Just like when you turn the lights off and feel like someone is staring at you from the darkness even though you KNOW there is nobody else in the room and you turn back the lights on from that convincingly scary feeling because it overpowers your rationality and logic, I feel the same way about suicide and depression. 

Sounds irrational, but feels convincing."
2661,depression,I just wish my father could’ve shut the fuck up.,"My father did tell me that I was his little Princess and that I was beautiful growing up only to tell me that I was too fat or that I needed to straighten my teeth afterwards.

Because of that whenever anybody compliments me, I don’t believe it. I don’t think they actually mean it, because neither did my father.

I just wish he wouldn’t have even tried at all to be a good father to me. Because he fucking failed every time. I just wish he was never a part of my life. I wish he never spoke to me. I wish I never knew who he was. I wish he just died before I was born. I just hate him very very very very very much and because of my father I am the insecure, miserable and hopeless piece of shit I am today. Because of him. All because of him. I hate him."
2662,depression,I am nothing more than a failure.,"I fear I’ve reached the end of the road. My depression has completely taken over my life. Fucking COVID MAN. If I never would’ve had that time off work I’d never realized how much I hated that job. Then I lost it. Now I’m unemployed, and I’m supposed to support my fiancé. We’ve been together for ten years and I’ve done nothing but hurt her. I’m such a terrible person. I think next time I dose DXM I’ll end it all."
2663,depression,Help! I'm seriously thinking of killing myself,"I can't do this anymore. It's too hard. My whole family hates me and blames me for everything. They never considered me a part of them and always treated me as I'm some sort of unwanted guest in their home. There is nth working for me. I didn't study or work what i wanted, I have both physical and mental health problems, I have been used a lot by my friends and I have financial problems. I can't think anymore. It's just too hard and no one seem to want me here so why stay? I can't even get a professional help because my family thinks I'm an awful human being who doesn't deserve anything. I really can't keep up with what's happening to me. I have ptsd, depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, I oversleep to 16 hours sometimes and recently I have been feeling like I'm on autopilot (depersonalisation). I have been trying so hard but life isn't getting easier and it feel like breathing is rather a task and a chore."
2664,depression,I’m so alone,Everyday feels like a monotonous void. I want to be with someone so bad but I know my lack of confidence and quiet characteristics are holding me back. It’s the worst when you know you have no one to blame but yourself. I just wish things would get better.

But I haven’t, and honestly I don’t know why.

I know I need to live, in order to be punished. But it's too much ai can't take this anymore. I Always compare those punishments to what have I done there's no punishment for my existence. I don't need to physically harm people of mentally harm them, just being next to them, existing by their sides is the worst thing someone could wish for. 
 I haven't eaten in 3 days, I am not planning on eating until I feel safe for eating food. I can't eat my mom's food, I can't eat my bought food, I can't drink water not even alcohol. I am crying I guess that speeds up the process of dehydration. I should have died a long time ago. My mother, won't let me see my friends until I clean all the house, I can't get out of my bed, what a pathetic failure I am. My Mom won't let me see him, but I solely exist to love him and I can't be close to him, why?... Why that's not fair... Any of this is not fair. I am tired of suffering, I can't do this anymore. 
I hate myself, I hate my family, oh god I should have never been born. What a burden I am. I should be dead. 
I don't have a father but he showed up last month because he saw me with my only reason to live. He went nuts. I don't understand, why?. Why whybwhywhywhywhywhyhwyhy. What the fuck have I done?! .. My mother won't approve him, my brother is 13  and acts like I am his property, he takes all the decisions about me. I am tired . If this is what being a girl is like I fucking hate it. I hate it. I should have been born with a dick maybe then I'd have the right to beat my sister, throw chairs around the house and insult my mom. Because I'm just a boy! Haha! Everyone wants me out of their way. 
Perfect. My life actually is perfect why am I overreacting. Obviously perfect. Perfect in every way. 
I'll lose myself and it's gonna be perfect, perfect. 
No more pain, no more bruises I won't know, I won't know. 
No more tears, I'll pull those eyes out that his left to cry with, perfect.
Love me I'll turn your love to endless lust, there's no way you're gonna leave me I've given you everything, You can't go. You can't make time for me. That's a waste. 
That's a fucking waste. Please, if I die. Just think you won't be spending more money on me.i never wanted you to buy me things why did you do that? 
I told you i didn't want clothes why did you buy me. Clothes. Now... Where are they gonna go?. 
If you wrap them around my dead self. They are gonna stain, all of your hard work will just end up with pretty stains.
I can't,  keep this.. Going.. Anymore.. 
I am. Officially done... I'll stop loving him. 
I'll stop seeing my friend... 
I'll stop talking stop eating and drinking water. 
Hopefully I'll stop breathing one day. 
Then I'll fix this world, by removing myself. 
Forgive me, for I have failed you. All."

2669,depression,Last Thursday I decided to kill myself. [Trigger warning if you are suicide sensitive],"Do you wake up in your bed, thinking about ending your life?

Do you think about how it would be if you end this constant charade that you play with your life?

Do you feel not good sometimes?

Do you feel not good all the time?

Do you have to tire yourself to sleep?

Are you fidgety and restless?

I have a few answers to the aforesaid questions, but first let me close the doors of this dusty old attic so that no one walks in on me. I don’t want anyone to see me like this. This naked. This vulnerable. This empty. This hollow.

It smells of dust and old furniture herein the attic. It makes my nose itch, but this dark dusty old attic is the only place which lets me confide. It is the only place in house where I don’t suffocate.

As I write this I feel like I’m holding a mic on podium of a theater and staring at the empty faces of the audience. It haunts me. So I’ll haunt them. I have decided however futile it seems I will go out there and speak.

If I think thoroughly about how loneliness has effected me. It helped me a lot when every time I was being told that I was not desired.

I joke about how hollow I have been.

For me vanity was like a pesky little sister of greed and runt of the desire. It filled me like a balloon is filled with air, only for some time and only to be hollow. It filled me just enough. But it always left me hollow. I kept sucking emptiness in this shell like a vacuum craving for void.

It was like cigarettes. I needed to burn another as soon as one ended.

I smoked my last cigarette by quarter past 01:00 at night. Smoking excessively throughout the day had made my head pound. At least it helped me not to feel empty, even if for a short while. I figured, it was ok if I burn and suffocate instead of feeling hollow and empty.

In the endless trail of solitude and longing, my hollowness has only deepened.

Morpheus! Even he betrays me nowadays. He never gives me dreams anymore. It’s like he is saying to me “Your time is up Foziwi, your account is closed now. I don’t have any more dream funds for you.”

I appreciate his japes. As for such emptiness, dreams can only be illusion and not some self-reflection. On the other hand this harmlessness suits me. My hollowness. My emptiness.

I darkness I kept staring at my ceiling and I don’t know when in between the agony headache and suffocation of my lungs I slipped into the realm of Morpheus.

I woke up at the brink of dawn, staring at the sidewall with the only thought to kill myself. My head was still pounding. I guess, while my mind was in nether-realm, my body was in agony.

I peeked outside to witness whether the sun is dead. Unfortunately, it was not. So I did the next best thing, which was to close the curtains. It’s not like I don’t want the sunlight to enter. However, I don’t want to witness my personal void escape.

This fight with life has been very futile for me. This fight with poverty, unemployment, relations of birth, relations of choice, relations imposed, to have a smile or to simply exist in this life appears futile to me. Sometimes I exist only as a witness. I witness the next day, the next person.

The façade has stolen everything that it offered. Yet I never disappoint it. I’m always lured into it. Only to be shattered again.

I don’t know when I became a poor excuse of man. But, I have been functionally living like this for quite some time now and I have figured how to exist. But unfortunately, I will always be part of those others."
2670,depression,Hollow,"I've made a lot of positive improvements to my life. Engaging in my hobbies more, working out, hanging out with friends and getting my life together. I feel better than i ever have before. Though, to get here i've ended up hurting a lot of people i care about and messing up relationships with wonderful people who don't deserve what i did to them  


Despite all of this, I feel so empty inside. As if, all the happiness i feel is just on the outer surface and inside there's nothing there, like i'm a doll.  


I've worked so hard to get to this point. I've sacrificed so much, ive hurt so many people, ive hurt myself. Yet at my destination, there wasn't anything there. I'm struck with waves and waves of guilt and suffering reflecting on whats happened the last year.   


But am i truly happy? I would say so in a more superficial sense i suppose. I'm enjoying life and looking forward to a lot more things. I smile and laugh a lot more now. But, its like the chains that hold me down are still there except i'm just not in complete darkness anymore. Yet, despite that my eyes are still closed so i can't see the light anyway. It hurts so much and i'm in so much pain but i still don't consider myself depressed. It's such a foreign feeling and im so lost as to what i should do."

Then the shadow grows and grows until it's impossible to ignore or distract myself from.
I don't know what I want from posting this. Maybe I just want to let it out publicly for once rather than in my notes that no one will ever read. Not really looking for advice or anything because I've been through this countless times. There's just some lows that feel really really low and writing about it seems to help a bit.

2673,depression,My head is racing with countless thoughts yet my heart just feels so empty,Is this what depression + anxiety is like?
2674,depression,Making Friends and Taking Care of Yourself,"In all the suggestions to help raise you from a depressive state, you would see the mention of exercise. Going to the gym, going for a run, etc.  
I've tried many times to exercise at home. Some times I start for a few days and then stop, or I don't start at all. There's also the embarrassment that my mom lives with me(she couldn't and now I can't afford to live separately), and she would mock me if she saw. That's not me being paranoid, she really would. She's done it before. She tends to paint a dim view of my ability to do anything new that I would like to try.   
So I tend to try to do these things in hiding, and I can, but then I always excuse myself that I'm feeling too exhausted. I mean it, though. I'm always exhausted. Basic tasks sap most of my strength. 

So, I look for alternatives. I can't go running, because I live in a dangerous area. There's no sports clubs or anything around here.

And to be honest, I don't like the gym. I don't want to build muscle or change anything about what I am(for now). And when I was a bit younger, I was mocked by gym-goers for being skinny and not wanting to change that, so I don't necessarily like the environment. 

I honestly like my body frame. I'm somewhat tall and lean. When I was young, I prided myself on my athleticism and being light on my feet. I was the fastest runner almost everywhere and I was an excellent swimmer. I hate the idea of people telling me how I should look.

But the problem I have is that I'm no longer even remotely fit. And I hate it. A simple burst sprint will have me huffing and puffing and that's not good enough. I'm also starting to put on weight, which for me is a sign of how much I'm letting go of myself. It really just increases the already intense state of self-loathing I have for myself.

I love sports, I really do, but as I said, they're not prevalent in my area. I did find a place to go and hopefully join up with a football club, and when I had talked myself into being brave enough to go and try, mentioned to my mom where I was going, and she told me that I'll just embarrass myself. In turn, I didn't go. I flaked. Again. 

In my country, there are massive problems with how people socialise. For example, it is a heavily racially obsessed country, and so people tend(I need a stronger word) to associate with others of their own race. I've been a witness to this since my school days. In many ways, this has been a problem for as I am heavily mixed race. There isn't really any understanding of my heritage or what demographics I am descended from. My parents were mixed race, and coincidentally their parents were mixed race, and not much from a racial standpoint is understood beyond that point. While this doesn't bother me, it's always been a problem for others who constantly want me to fit their perception.  
And so, I am indeed scared of being the odd one out. The anomaly. I feel like that in my own home, and I've felt that way a multitude of times throughout my life, and I don't want to go through that again.  
Which leaves little in the way for friendships and spontaneous moments. Fear.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, after my intense rambling, I do have a question.

For those of you who partake in regular exercise regimes and have kept it going, if you ever felt like me, where you had apathy towards everything, and chronic exhaustion, how did you manage to combat it and get started?

I typed all of this just for that. Apologies. .\_."
2675,depression,I think I may have depression but I don't know how to tell anyone.,"Sorry for this long post, I just wanted to get this off my chest.

My negative thoughts kind of started when I was in college (2016) and started doing really badly in school. Eventually after 2 years, I got really bad grades for my final exam. So while most people I knew were going to top local universities, my only real option was a private university. Because of this, my mother and I got into a lot of arguments (2018-2019). During these arguments, she would often bring up how I wasn't hardworking (she is half right) and shit talk me just because she wanted to shame me over my bad results even if the argument had nothing to do with education at all. She often threatened to kick me out or not leave me any inheritance. For these 2 years I was serving conscription and had some time to re-evaluate what to do next. But frankly, her constant attacks on my results has dragged me down to a point where I was afraid to talk about it at all. In addition most people who go to college here do really well so it made it extra shameful to talk about my results among my peers. Because of this I distanced myself from most of my friends but none of them really bothered to reach out to me as well. 

Last year, I was really tempted to shoot myself a few times during my duties/live firings because I felt I had let everyone down and it didn't seem like any of my friends ever genuinely cared for me. And my whole family was always harping on my poor results as well (too many details to go into). But I never did because I lacked the balls. 

This Covid situation hasn't really helped either. While I am definitely not suicidal now, the lack of opportunity to get to know new people from online lessons while seeing my ex college friends expanding their social circles in their top universities makes me feel really unwanted and more depressed. I just want to be normal. I just want some friends to care for me.

P.s: I know my mother loves me and I am definitely flawed (and to be blamed in many aspects), but I feel really lost, direction-less and miserable. And honestly a huge part is because she kept dragging me down.

Thanks for reading."

I just think if you have depression and need help you should be able to get help and get taken seriously relentless of gender identity, race, or wealth. Cherry on top is when I reached out to professionals and they denied help because of covid (I reached out to 5 in my area), I just feel like the whole world just wants to get rid of me."

Everyone is fanatic,  they do not hesitate to say bad things about people against them. Going into traffic is like suicide. It is guaranteed that you will be involved in a meaningles fight.  Bullies never go to jail,  never get punished. 

  Our currency has no value, government get extreme taxes.  there is no social activities for poor people. There is no way for poor people to buy things except basic needs. Even foods are expensive. 

  I have never been a child. I have never played happily. I have never learned any sports.I have met the language english when i was 18 years old. I learned it by myself.  No one has  taught me anything. The education i got was no good. I just strived and strived.  Everything i learned belongs to me, no one has any contribition on it. I am not egoist, it is a sad fact. I wish my schools and my teachers were quailified enough to make me well educated. 

People born in europe, or usa are just lucky. You can get well education,  if you start working you can have a car within a year with your minimum wage.  Now i am 20 years old. Altough my conditions were bad, not proper for studying, i won  the best university in my country. I will be computer engineer  4 years later.  I am not making any money as a student . I will live 4 years too as a poor man. After that i can get salary let's say 4000 turkish liras. 2000 tl is rent, 1000 tl is basic needs ,1000 tl is savings. 

To buy a  car i sould work 100 months. Cheapest car is around 100 thousand turkish lira. After that to buy a house i should work 400 months. These  are  just two basic needs. Travelling is luxury.  1 dolar is 8 turkish liras. It is not possible for me to travel europe, USA or any other country. I have never been abroad.   

How can i not be mad about my country, my faith.  My life is worthless, i was born to suffer. Enjoying this life is not possible for me. My question is how can i go back to year 2000 and be born in well developed country?  I just want live my childhood and youth. I want to be well educated. I want to feel secure when i go out . I want to say my opinions without fear of getting arrested.  I want to do sports in  well facilities. I just want to enjoy this life"

All the bad things, the anger outbursts are esting me from inside
how could i forgive myself for all the suffering, the ruined moods and days of people close to me
Why i do not want to have fun but only be alone and dwell on my feelings 
Day from day trying to find an anwser which probably does not exist
Short burst of joy when I find an explanation are diminished by my lack of motivation to help myself get better.
I don’t believe anymore that one day it will get better, i do not believe that there is an answer to my problems and I just can’t stand the idea that I would have to learn and “cope” with this feeling.
How can You cope when the motivation, the joy, the charisma, the energy, even the basic feeling of reality is being taken away from You.
I feel worthless, like a big lump of fat, junk food, nicotine and all the shit that comes into my body. 
I can’t be persistent in things like working out, yoga and meditation as one day i just wake up and say “fuck it”.
The idea of taking my own life seems more appropriate every day.
Why not? Why not because I am afraid to live, I am afraid to have fun, every day I am accompanied by feelings of depersonalization and derealization, on each step I question reality, most of the time I just zone out.
Even suicide starts seeming not an answer because I cannot believe the notion that everything will be over, peaceful and loving on the other side. Everyday I feel like this, how could I cope with sudden feelings of relief and hapiness. It even becomes as a place of comfort - feeling depressed, angry, worthless.
The idea of everything being ok and that my brain would just forget all this stuff I went through. 
Would I feel happy if I got relief? Probably not as the traumatic experience would remind of itself in my memory, keeping me from living my life.
Everyday I spend hours searching for an answer in neurobiology, genetics, spirituality, psychology with no help as I still feel as an observer watching myself trying to crawl out of an ever growing blackhole."

I’m depressed for many reasons but two of my main reasons is cause of my dick and performance in sexual situations. I’m so insecure about my dick and it’s driving me crazy (6.3in X 4.3in) lmao. I’m pretty tall so it looks even smaller and it’s putting me on edge of suicide. My anxiety makes it even worse and makes me super worried about my dick every second of the day. To make matters even worse is that i have really bad premature ejaculation. I’m starting to get in a relationship with this girl and as u can tell i’m already beyond insecure about my size. A few days ago she started feeling me up and then eventually grabbed my dick and honestly i felt like i was going to bust right away. If it’s already not bad enough i’m worried about my size but now i have to deal with not lasting more than a few seconds. Like if that’s not suicidal fuel then idk what is. I honestly don’t know what to do besides obviously killing myself so my problems can just go away. I don’t see any point of living like this for the rest of my life lmao.

2692,depression,Things have been tough.,"Hello, I'm new to this sub. I'm thankful for it because I need a place to just put all the shit in my head down in front of people who at least understand. I'm not usually one to create a post but this sub seems like a safe place to so thank you all just for reading in advance. Also, sorry it's a long read but I can't stop typing.

I've been clinically depressed since high school. My older brother, my best support, is 4 years older and was out of the house by then. My parents got divorced before my freshman year and since I was the only one around spent the next 4 years, they funneled all the horrible shit they had to say about each other through me, and used me as a tool against each other. My dad would pick me up from school and force me to go out with him to eat before we got home, and spend 2-3 hours using me (middle schooler) as his personal therapist and telling me all the horrible things that he could think of. They never got an official custody ruling, leaving me to choose who to spend my nights with meaning I never got a guilt-free night of sleep knowing I'd left the other parent alone. 

My mom has always been supportive, but my dad is an extreme narcissist and control freak who genuinely believes he can do no wrong. He verbally bullied my mom, my brother and me my whole life. He'd call me a fatass, my brother a loser, my mom an idiot, etc. One time I made a bad pass in a hockey game and he screamed at me while I was trapped in the car with him for two full hours, telling me I embarrassed him. I told him I wanted to quit because he was ruining the fun and then he said ""fine, then just be a fat loser and quitter"" or something to that effect, then continued yelling even after we got home and sporadically through the proceeding weeks and months (yes, for the same pass which affected nothing). When my team won the state tournament later and we went to celebrate with our parents in the locker room and I told him how excited I was that we won. He said I didn't deserve to be excited since I was useless and contributed nothing to the team. 

Despite all this, he's my dad and I always make excuses for him. He moved away during my senior year of high school, basically abandoning his fatherly duties, and then guilted me into going to college near where he now lived.  He would ask me to come out to his house during the school week to help him with his stupid fucking projects and scold me and imply I was a bad son if I told him I was too busy and had homework. 

He ended up getting sick and demanding everyone stop what they're doing and attend to him or he'd stop paying for school. He's always needed to be the center of attention and his problems are \*always\* worse than yours and he's not afraid to let you know every time, and he can run his mouth for 2 hours easy just to make you feel like a piece of shit. I got too stressed because my brother has become a heroin addict due to our whole childhood being fucked because of our dad, and I in turn became a severe, at death's door alcoholic.

I spent the next few years as a functioning alcoholic, trying to support my brother now since his addiction was getting worse. Eventually though I hit a tipping point and lost my job, my fiancee, and eventually was forced into a rehab after drinking myself into a coma. I learned there that my alcoholism is because of all the stress of my family and their bullshit, even though I always convinced myself they weren't \*that\* bad. They said I had to address my reservations with my family members, but that's impossible because my brother is always fucked up and my dad will never listen.

I actually rebounded pretty well out of rehab. My fiancee took me back, I landed a job and was promoted twice very quickly and earning good salary, and my brother was stable enough to help my dad out where he lived. Things were finally coming together. Then my dad calls me at work one day to say my brother attacked him by hitting him in the eye with a piece of wood when my dad was trying to wake him up from a heroin nap. This is a regular occurrence, my dad calling me telling me I need to drive 6 hours to help him because my brother OD'd again, me either finding a way to go and help or telling them that I can't, then feeling guilty and worthless and hopeless after. The stress was adding up, and I wanted to drink again, so I had to quit before I went back to the bottle. I had a chance to move to FL and take a job with the same company, but my fiancee told me not to since she wanted to move somewhere else and she made a big emotional show out of it, so I don't take the job and COVID hits. I had been trying to go back to school and made it one semester but now with no income and the creeping stress daring me to drink it wasn't do-able.

  
Fast forward, despite her asking me not to take that job, she's upset that I'm unemployed and not in school and starts seeing someone else. I can't find a job. I get a call that my brother was arrested dropping off a girl somewhere while on heroin AND meth now. I call my dad begrudgingly to ask if I could borrow some money and he basically turns it into a pissing match about how bad he has it compared to me and that I need to be his full time caretaker if he gives me anything. I can't have that and hang up. He then sends friends of his to where I live to try to pressure me to moving to his town to be basically his personal therapist/slave. I applied for unemployment months ago and they've barely made any progress, and I'm now borrowing money from my mother to eat.

I can't drink, I have no money, my fiancee fucked off, I can't find work, I can't sleep but I do just lay there for hours, I don't enjoy anything I used to, I'm constantly riddled with anger, guilt, regret, and sadness over my family situation, I can't afford gas, my internet is getting shut off in a couple days, I'm uninsured and have an infected tooth that is just throbbing, I can't afford my antidepressants, I'm in massive medical debt from my coma, and sometimes to reassure myself I'll think ""well maybe you'll just die tomorrow and then it's all solved at least"". I have no hope for myself or my future, and each day that passes just mocks me and I don't think I'll ever escape this cesspool life of mine."
2693,depression,I don't think I know how to maintain or be in relationships,"Friendships in general. Just recently I've came to realised that I'm really bad at keeping relationships with people. I'm usually the one who tries to start the conversation by asking how they are doing if they are okay and that's all we really usually end up talking about.

There's no constant conversation like how I usually see some of my friends have with their other friends, and yeah there is definitely some sort of envy somewhere. There's only ever one friend that I talk to on a day-to-day basis, he's considered a like a brother to me since we've been talking years back online. The number of friends I have can be counted just using 2 hands. I'm not particularly bothered by the amount of friends that I have because over the years I've adapted more to quality &gt; quantity, and I would rather have just few amazing friends that I can trust.

But part of me sometimes hopes to just stop talking to people and actually see if anyone is gonna try to initiate anything but that's a pretty asshole move right there. I'm also not the type for being too socially active and most of the time I'm extra careful about what I say before hitting send.

I feel like I'm the type that most people would probably find boring and uninteresting to talk to. I believe I have a pretty low presence as well in general (like people can actually take some time to even notice that I'm there). And well, interacting with people is more difficult than I thought, especially when it comes to keeping conversations going."
2694,depression,Feels like people just put up with me,"All my life I've felt like a parasite but over the last few months those feelings have intensified. I don't feel interesting, funny or kind enough for anyone's time. I don't have anything to offer anyone, I am just annoying and some people take pity in that I suppose.

I wish that I didn't feel this way but honestly how people treat me just reinforces that mindset. Needed to get that off my chest"
2695,depression,I’m tired of being lonely and i’m shit at writing titles,"I always try shit like this but it never works so whatever here goes nothing. 

This is gonna be a long one so idk buckle up if you feel like reading it. 

When i was 15 i was a sophomore in high school and i had some friends. Not a lot but i mean.. some. Well i started dating this girl that i had been friends with since my 6th grade year. First relationship so not a lot to go off in terms of reference of what was a red flag. Well not to get too into it but she was extremely manipulative and abusive (in a lot of ways but especially in a social aspect) and before i knew it, it was 2 years later and i had no friends bc i wasn’t allowed to talk to anyone she wasn’t friends or didn’t approve of. (which was literally every damn one. Except her fucking brother who ALWAYS turned a blind eye to how she treated me. Anyways.) But she was allowed to do whatever she wanted and i was never allowed to get mad. So boom i had no friends, or anyone to go to. Well finally i broke up with her bc i got tired of being sad and feeling worthless bc of her. Well that didn’t work too well bc like i said i had no friends to go to. Her and her brother (and one of her friends who was in love with her brother 🙄) were all i had. And obviously if i didn’t speak to my ex they wouldn’t speak to me. Well most ppl would cut their losses and move along but i was 17 about to finish high school and i was severely depressed due to home life, that situation and some other things, so being lonely was literally awful and i couldn’t do it. So i decided to be her friend bc everything was okay when we were friends before. 

plot twist: everything was not okay. 
she continued to control all aspects of my social life. dating life, platonic relationships, family relationships while she got to still do whatever she wanted and at this point of the abuse cycle i honestly just believed her. So that’s really all i really have to say about why i didn’t just drop her 

Fast forward to the present. I no longer speak to her. Idk where tf she is thank god. I now have a gf who treats me well. and actually cares about me. We’ve been together for a little over a year now. She’s great. i only really went into details bc i don’t want someone to just be like “ah nah. no friends?? this dude must be weird as fuck.” 

Anyways I said all that to say this: i still don’t really have any friends. I would like some (specifically guy friends tbh bc a dude needs some damn guy friends 😂. but i’m not gonna ignore you solely if you’re a girl) I have a few friends but only bc they’re my girlfriend’s friends. and i mean they’re cool. But 1. they’re all girls and 2. i would like have some of my own friends to talk to and joke with and chill with if you live around me. Anyways yeah 
So if you wanna be friends hmu. I live in GA at the moment so if you’re close even better 
i’d prefer around my age so like 18-25
uhhh that’s about it. 
i play ps4 if anyone cares. hmu for my snap or any of my socials"

My boss likes to have daily team video calls. I find them so difficult. It's like my brain just wants to shut down. I find two people talking at me, talking over each other and being so hyper too overwhelming.  
Also, when we had voice calls, I could easily fake being happy and upbeat. But I have no poker face at all and when we do the ""how is everyone today"" / tell me your mood bit of the call I'm too tired not to be honest. Whenever I say I'm really tired or down, my coworker immediately starts questioning me.   
""But why?""  
""I just am.""  
\*coworker head-tilt, eyes narrowed\* ""Yes, but why?""  
This happens every time! It's much better with my boss; she approaches things differently. I just don't want to be scrutinised/questioned every time my mood isn't as good as my coworker thinks it should be. It tanks my mood even further.  
Does anyone else struggle with video calls or have any coping mechanisms?"

2702,depression,I'm Just Lost about what to do.,"This is a two person question.  In May my husband was laid off work.  At first he seemed to be taking it as well as anyone could be, and I thought I was doing the same.  But as time goes on, he is getting more and more depressed.  He is having a very hard time finding work and he is questioning the choices he's made in life.  I have been sliding down as well.  I find myself just sitting out on the balcony for hours at night not knowing what to do.  Today though, it seems as if my husband broke.  Half way through the day, he was talking about leaving because that was the best option because he was not a good husband or father.  I tried to rationalize with him, but I also knew that would probably be futile in his current mindset.  Meanwhile, I am trying to deal with this whole situation myself, while trying to not let my own depression take over.  Everyday feels like a struggle and I feel more tired each morning. I am trying to be supportive of him, and trying to encourage him, but I can't seem to say or do anything to help.  I suggested that he talk to someone and his response was, ""What are they going to tell me that I don't already know?""

This evening we were supposed to have a movie night with my son, but my husband left half way through dinner and went to the bed room and closed the door.  I assumed he wanted to have time to himself, so I let him be.  After my son and I finished dinner, I put on the movie for him and got him set up, but I went to our office and had some alone time because I am so completely overwhelmed by this situation. I guess my husband had fallen asleep by accident because he woke up about and hour later and was mad at me because I was down there by myself.  I tried to tell him that I just needed some time, but he is still mad, and sad, and isolated, and a whole host of other things.  He accused me of trying to make this about myself.  I just want to know what to do.  It is so incredibly hard to deal with all of this, and I can't talk to him because it makes him feel awful because he thinks it's his fault because he lost his job.  I tried to tell him that 30 million other people are in the same position and he is not responsible for any of this, but I know that it just isn't getting through right now.  I guess I just need some advice and someone to have a conversation with.  I am all out of ideas."

I've tried everything every pill, every drug, gone to the best doctors of every feild, tradicional medicine, therapy... Everything.

Eaven the days I feel strong and try to have a fucking normal Life, anything (high pitch sounds, lights, smells...) triggers me and fucks me up for the rest of the day.

It sucks. I'm tired. Nothing helps. I spend most of the time on bed or numming away the pain with drugs.
I try to maintain my relationships, but when i'm in pain i'm rude and I push people away. I don't want to do this, I don't want to treat people like this. I don't want to be like this.
i don't know what im gonna do with my life, I culdn't study so I droped out of highschool. My pain has pushed me away from everyone I love, i spend most of my the time in bed and the rest of the time i go out and get as high as i possibly can so i can forget my shitty life for a while... It sucks.

I've been too close to killing myself over this so many times, I can't belive i haven't done It jet

2705,depression,Traumatising my best friend (sh tw) please help,"So I'm on holiday in Spain atm and I found something I could use to sh. Long story short I got a bit drunk, purged, hated myself and ultimately ended sh-ing. Before this I had been clean for about a month and a half so was already feeling super shit about purging and breaking my clean streak. Turns out I had harmed really quite bad, I suspect that I needed stitches. I was too overwhelmed and weak from blood loss to sort myself out and clean up so I had to text my friend in the next room down. She had to walk in on me in that state and help me clean up. I feel fucking dreadful about it because I'm sure it was a horrendous traumatic experience for her and I feel so so guilty. I know that I should but I physically can't bring myself to apologise because that means a conversation about it and I'm not ready for that.I know that means I'm an awful person but I just can't do it. Any suggestions on what to do? I could really use some help/support"
2706,depression,I hate this,"I've had a headache for the last three days. I have lost interest in so many things. And every God damn thing I do feels like a fucking chore. I'm miserable and irritated... to the point where I am sick of hearing my family's voices...and talking to people in general. 
I don't want to die tbh i just want to leave. My life, family, friends all that. Just throw my phone in a random dumpster and just leave so I won't be a burden on anyone anymore and I can't just be left alone.

There's no one to talk to. I feel very alone despite being surrounded by so many fucking people."
2707,depression,I sleep a lot and stay in my room.,"I have always been like this for a long time and I just usually spend my days sleeping or laying in bed watching movies all day without hardly seeing anyone ever. I have social anxiety, panic disorder and depression along with learning disabilities. I have no friends, no job or career path, no car. I basically have no motivation to do anything because I think what’s the point, we all die and nothing really matters and we are all pretty damn useless and meaningless in the bigger picture. I will probably die from depression and probably will never be able to manage depression."
2708,depression,I think the pleasure centres in my brain are fucked,"It's like they simply stopped functioning. I could be in a room full of puppies, or across the world at some resort, I could stumble upon a million dollars tomorrow and I'm pretty sure I'd feel just as dead as I do now. Food doesn't taste good anymore. Music sucks. Video games bore the shit out of me. Movies and shows can't hold my attention for longer than a few seconds. Hell, I can't even feel anything during sex. I think my brain is just faulty and it goes beyond mental illness."
2709,depression,I don't want to hang out with my friends and I'm not entirely sure why or how to tell them.," So, I know that question must sound confusing, so I'll elaborate.

For   reference, I am a 16 year old girl in high school and I have a close   friendship with three other people. We would always do things together   and we all get along great.

Another   important note to add that I think ties into all of this is the fact   that I lost my father about 6 months ago. It has been a really hard   process, and I have had my ups and downs along the way so far.

During   the coronavirus, it was difficult for be to be able to go through a   ""normal"" grieving process, which can include therapy and constantly   being surrounded by friends and family. Aside from my mother and sister,   there really is nobody else to talk to regarding these things, and I   believe this has caused me to become closed off towards people. I've   developed unhealthy eating habits as a coping mechanism, and overall   these have made me insecure about my body and less confident as a whole.

So,   I've become closed off, and I don't want to hang out with them. Don't   get me wrong, I still love my friends and we text everyday and FaceTime  a  couple of times a week. To be honest, I wouldn't even mind just  hanging  out with them in somewhere private like one of our houses. But  they  always want to go on these crazy adventures at the beach or places  like  that, and I really just don't feel comfortable doing those  things. But, I  don't want to seem like a buzzkill either. I've been  constantly making  up excuses as to why I cannot hang out, and even  though they don't  outright say it, I know that they are getting annoyed  with me. I am just  afraid that this is going to affect our friendship  in the long run, and  that is the last thing I want to happen.

I   know this situation might not be the most relatable to everyone, but I   would really appreciate some feedback or advice. I really don't want  to  lose my friends, and I want to figure out what is wrong internally  and  try to work through the problem."
2710,depression,I feel dead inside,"So I’ve suffered with severe depression throughout my life. I’ve visited so many doctors and therapist but none seem to help. Recently I’ve been the happiest I’ve ever been because I met the girl of my dreams. She told me that she liked me and I told her that I liked her but we both mutually decided to wait to date until corona was over. She has a lot of guys best friends because she has no dad and her brother took his life a few years back and it helps her cope having male role models in her life. Today out of nowhere she texted me saying that she caught feelings for her guys bestfriend and how she wants to date her guy bestfriend. She then proceeded to push me away and tell me how our friendship won’t ever be the same. She was the only thing in life that made happy and gave me the strength to keep going forward.

2717,depression,I need help,"I am not able to move on from my last relation, my entire life is falling apart and I can't fix it. My ex-girlfriend is uploading photos of her new boyfriend, the more I look at it the more I hate myself. I have no idea how to get out of this. I need some help."
2718,depression,My life sucks,"Ever since I was born I’ve never had a great life, my dad left when I was born and then I find out I had a brother who died before I was born, then my sister was crazy she did drugs and had sex when she was 13 or 14. My mom always had heart problems and she got surgery too late so her new fake heart won’t hold up for too long, she only has a few month or if luck a year to live, and honestly I’m just 15, I don’t have friends or any other family and my sister lives all the way in Europe (I’m from the us). And I’ve tried to make friends and get a gf and everyone just said I was boring and left me, i had this one guy who said he was my friend but I didn’t want to be friends with him bc he told me he was a cannibal and wanted to kill his step father, but then I went to ask a girl out and she kept ignoring me and asked me to tell her about my “friend” and I told her he’s weird and she shouldn’t go with him but she refused and then a few days later she went missing and then turns out he got arrested for almost eating her. Idk honestly what my life is, I’m just gonna kill myself after my mom dies bc I’ll have no where to be or no one on my side. Good bye."
2719,depression,I cried in front of someone for the first time since October. I am now avoiding everyone who cares about me.,"The other day, after a long, rough day at work, I went to the bar and was feeling fairly tipsy. After I left, I went to the house of a regular at that bar and had a conversation about life, and how I thought things were going well for me. We were drinking as this conversation happened, and marijuana was involved too. I'm not sure what I was talking about, but there was a moment where I said ""I'm not sure whether or not I should-"" and stopped myself, but they finished my sentence for me: ""put a bullet in your head?""
It processed a moment and I broke down. I left as quickly as I could without being rude, and went to sleep when I got home.

Since then, I've been sliding downward, as I have done time and time before. I thought I was doing well. I thought I was fighting my depression and finally making my life better for myself. I guess I was wrong. Within a week, I've contemplated leaving my job that I enjoy, and I've been avoiding talking to people as much as I can. My work ethic has dropped from a hard worker to a lazy klutz. I've returned from being energized to exhausted all the time. I want to isolate myself entirely, not even for quarantine, and not go to work anymore. Why does this happen every time"
2720,depression,I broke today,"I don't know if I have the will in me to type it all out, but I got bad again. Why can't I just be normal, why do I have to feel like this all the time."
2721,depression,Is there a way to improve my mental state while continuing to keep it to myself?,"I want to get better and get out of this depression that I’ve been in for the past 2 and a half years but I also don’t want any of my friends and family to know about it. I had a plan to blow my brains out but I backed out cuz I’m a coward, and since then I’ve just come to terms with the fact that I don’t have the guts to put an end to it myself. I feel miserable and think about suicide almost constantly, I’ve grown numb to having the image of me as a corpse in my head. I need it to stop but I can’t let anyone I’m close to know about it but I don’t know how."
2722,depression,No one wants me and I don't blame them,It's really hard to not let the feeling that no one want me when ever piece of my life points to it being true.

2724,depression,"Back again, i'm slowly reaching rock bottom again.","Wow, I really just wish I could be normal. As stupid as it sounds, I do. I'm part of a band now, going to release music now, i'm social again and i've been writing music. But i'm getting tired of it, it's so tiring and boring. Playing music and being with people is losing it's pleasure. I can barely bring myself to play guitar, and I have to practice for real now. I'm tired of living the same fucking few months over and over again. Losing everything for 1 or 2 months, getting better and getting hopeful all for it to come down again. I'm losing this fight again, I wish I could just drug myself to sleep."
2725,depression,How,"How do u keep going.? When its so easy to stop. Im almost 19. I thought i would be so much better then I am. I have like 1 friend. My cousins birthday is coming up, my sister and her bf are gonna hang out with him and his gf. I wasn't even invited. She just told me about it. Im tired. Im so tired and I have been for a while. I have nieces and nephews to think about but its hard. Bc I really am so tired. Hos do u keep going when u don't want to"
2726,depression,Why I can never date,"I absolutely cannot date now and most likely won't ever be able to. Why? Because every girl out there is going to see my friends and go ""damn, why didn't I date them?"" they are all superior. They're stronger, taller, they can drive. There's literally no reason anyone would ever pick me. I'm most likely going to live out the rest of my days overshadowed by my friends who are all way above me in nearly every possible way.

I can't date. I know the second my girlfriend or boyfriend meets the friends I hang out with, whether they admit it or not, they will regret their choice and if they say they don't they're lying. As much as it sucks we're all materialistic to some degree. They will always want the taller and stronger guy."

2735,depression,Is social distancing or even isolation my ultimate medication?,"I'm bipolar. My highs aren't that high, but my lows are always very low.

I went for several different combinations of medications in the last five years and was still unstable sometimes. Turns out that coronavirus happened and I never felt so stable in my life.

I've always had problems with social anxiety, and I think that the fact that I'm having a minimal interaction with people in the last five months is helping me keep sane.

I was always so stressed going to the university because I had to see people and talk with them... Some people are freaking out because they have social interactions limited, and I have not a single desire to go to parties, family or friend reunions, even less to bigger events. I've always considered myself antisocial, but I don't know until when this can keep.

My only problem right now is that I have my master's dissertation to finish and anhedonia is preventing me to do it. It's been really hard to find something that can keep me interested and excited for long. When I have to do something is a gigantic effort, but at least I'm not thinking that ending my life is a solution anymore, but I miss the kind of manic behaviour that I have when I'm obsessed with something... This way everything has no flavour and I don't know what is worse.

Sorry for long post and thanks in advance for reading. I would love some comments about this situation."
2736,depression,stuff just feels off,"I've been depressed forever but stuff's really gotten bad this past week. Today it got to a point where it's not even sadness, stuff just feels off and sorta far away. Idk if that makes sense."
2737,depression,I never know what to say,"I never know what to say. I never know what to say. I have to think of a response that fits. I press a button in my brain and it falls into the conversation like a tetris piece. There’s no before or after. Just the next tetris piece and the next until there is no need for one.

I have to explain everything to myself all the time in my head."
2738,depression,I'm so depressed I want to scream,"We're all going through tough times and to be honest, there's no major problems in my life. I hate how this disorder, disease, whatever you want to call it, comes and attacks you out of nowhere. I have been blessed in so many ways. I've been fine since January. I don't understand what's wrong. 

This episode has been going on for days and it feels like real sadness. Not the sadness I'm used to with depression, but almost like grief. I've been feeling like something is going to happen to me and its embarrassing to talk about. I sound paranoid. I have this whole fun and positive outlook on reddit and in real life but I'm so sad, lately. Its based off of nothing. I know I'm the only me and its special to be alive but sometimes I just want out."
2739,depression,bullied,"Hi guys. I worked at my job for almost a year. Monday I finally got sick of being treated like shit by the ones who'd been there longer than I. I'm extremely depressed. My eyes are bruised from crying constantly. I have tons of schoolwork to do and can't focus. I had an interview yesterday.
It feels like I'm not doing enough, idle time sucks. I know it's only been 2 days but it feels horrible.
Management and HR failed me, to protect themselves and the other few coworkers it seems. I guess I wasn't important, no matter how hard I worked. 
Has anyone else had this happen to them or a friend? I need advice in general.
My spouse is very supportive and is the one who said I need to just quit, because I've tried to get along with the 'ol biddies' long enough.
This sucks. Sorry for the long winded vent."
2740,depression,I don’t want to live like this anymore.,"If you’re reading this, I think I’ve gotten to a point with myself where I can no longer function without feeling an overwhelming sense of emptiness. it has become a routine for me every single day to reach an extreme low in my mood, to the point where I must sleep or stay alone. It makes me unable to draw because I cannot see straight, and I can’t read because I get too deep into my own intrusive thoughts. It’s funny to be feeling this way right before I move to college and start the rest of my life, really. It’s even more funny that I felt this way much before and to this day, six days after my BIRTHDAY. Will I even be able to get to see what the future holds? Probably not. That is okay though because there is nothing for me anyways. I want to go into Biochemistry to help discover treatments for people, but I’m sure I won’t be able to find something the government doesn’t already have hidden away from the public until they can profit from it. No one really wants me around for long, in terms or friendship, and men only want be when I can feed into my sexual desires. I am so lonely and after dating someone for almost three years, them leaving you for a friend in a week, and being unable to find someone who loves me for over a year and a half now, I’ve lost hope with romance, even though it is my main pursuit. All I want is to be hugged again and told that I am special and worthy of someone’s time and to be held and understood for once. I feel like I can feel my chest hurting when I try to breathe. It’s hard to type with tears in your eyes. I wish I could be good enough for just one person. Or even myself, really. I don’t think I can ever truly be happy or make someone else happy. I can’t remember things much, often forgetting if I even ate. I just make mistakes and make people not like me or just be a burden. I don’t even know if the free counseling at my college will help me, and it’s getting harder and harder to try and wait for it. Why prolong this feeling of misery I’ve had for months when I could just finally be done with it? I wish no one knew I existed. I haven’t cried this much in a long time. All I want to do is stay asleep so I can stop overthinking the little things that trigger me into my daily downward spirals. I wish I had the guts to end it."
2741,depression,Trying to therapize yourself,"I’m always trying to tell myself why things are happening. I create these theories about my depressions and my emotions. The reasons for it. And by preaching to myself...it makes me so frustrated. I wish I could just stop analyzing everything all the time and just be. Is the analyzing causing it? Is the analyzing the one thing leading to a solution I should stick to?

I find that reaching these conclusions don’t do much...it’s an endless investigation...you can’t think yourself out of depression.

And then I started getting into spirituality. And I haven’t been spiritual since I was a child. Ekhart Tolle books, meditation, I just ended up feeling like I was forcing it all on myself. I’d get frustrated and confused. I don’t know...I just don’t trust my perceptions anymore...the way I do things...the things I’m writing right now...it just all seems like it’s floating around forever...and then I doubt if I’m even depressed. But this isn’t a pain contest and everyone’s depression is different.

I recently watched this video that said that resilience comes from accepting your depression and not keeping it a secret tucked inside of you. But I don’t think that means screaming out to everyone. So how do you make depression feel less like a secret impediment that you wish you could wish away? How do I stop automatically tuck away my emotions and snap into functioning. I don’t know... the thing is I’m not in a deep intense depression, but more that I don’t know how to make a decision or choices that will make me feel less like I’m trapped in a room that never changes. Like I can do all these things I’m meant to do...because it’s something. And something is better than nothing.

I’m rambling. But how do you learn to live with your depression rather than trying to solve it, because whenever I try to solve it, it just gets worse?"
2742,depression,I tried to kill myself yesterday.,"But I didn’t. I don’t know why. But I didn’t. I remember feeling frustrated that I couldn’t cut my wrist any deeper. 

Then I went to my father, and confessed everything. My feelings, my suicidal thoughts, what I just tried to do. And it went well. He responded calmly and told me that he was so proud of me for being strong. For not doing it, and for telling him. We had a long talk with him and the rest of my family. 

And he said that I’m not allowed to go to rooms alone, and my little sister should follow me everywhere. (My little sister doesn’t know).

But now I feel stuck. What should I do? I didn’t think I’d see this day. The feelings of numbness, and wanting to not exist is still there. I feel much much better that I told my family. But I don’t know what to do. I’m living for them, for my little sister, and I can’t give up. But I don’t know what to do.

Please someone just tell me what."
2743,depression,"etfh srtxirsuini,sxr6i","fuck my life, I cant find a job, no talent I cant even use what i have finished in college im too fucking afraid to kill myself idont wanna live anymore i have pushed everyone away, anything everything is fucking failure im a fucking bad luck god please stop fucking with me my liver is fucking screaming at me fuck this miserable fucked up life"
2744,depression,How my life is now.,"Now I know none of you may care but I just got the sudden realization that I have no one I can talk to anything about. Like every one of my friends has that person that they can say anything to and they’ll keep it a secret or they will try and help them through it. But I just feel like this is how my life will be till I die. No real friends, having to work 6 days a week, a college freshmen and just turning 18 having to live on my own. I’m honestly scared to start this new chapter in my life without someone there with me. Sorry I’ve been rambling but I needed to get this out somewhere and just decided to put it here for someone to find. Thank you for reading if you’ve made it this far. ❤️"

I never considered myself actually depressed but I don't wanna be alive anymore at times. I try so hard to please other people but I get nothing out of it. I pray to God about it as well but I never get an answer. Someone please help me."
2750,depression,I don't know what to think at this point.,"I don't know if I have depression, I've always been hesitant to call myself ""depressed"" because of the stereotype regarding it now. It's got a real bad stigma to it I don't want to apply myself to, and I like to distance myself from that word. I guess to give context, I have absolutely no self confidence and I constantly see flaws within myself to the extent where I actively turn away potential relationships because I feel they deserve better than whatever the hell I could give them lol. It's a little soul crushing constantly being reminded of my position as the fat friend and people showing visible disgust when somebody jokingly says I'd make a cute couple with someone. Maybe I'm just tired, especially since It's like 1:36 AM. If you bothered to read through some of this, hi."
2751,depression,Bouncing Around the Room,"I’ve posted this before - but I’m in that funky area in my mind again.   Funny how taking a break from work and resting can actually become a depressing experience.    Yeah, so the back story is something like this:

1. briefly homeless at age 15 - dad just didn’t pay the rent one day and was &lt;poof&gt; gone I never saw or heard from him again.
2. mother had a nervous breakdown at that time
3. due to a general instability in my micro family I left home at 18 and never returned
4. While still in my 20s I realize that I need to go to college or I’ll always be trapped so I made a plan
5. I went homeless again, on purpose, and started school - got my electrical engineering degree in 1995.
6. my engineering job paid for my master’s in electrical engineering
7. I bought a house in one of the most expensive areas in the country

I’ve got a few more cool achievements as well as a few more strikes against me during my early life - but, I’d best remain anonymous.  

I’ve never been more proud of this.   I’ve never been so alone.   I have no family at all.  The holidays really suck.  Aside from a few acquaintances from work - no friends.   If I were to die tomorrow only the bill collectors would miss my checks.    I’ve lost purpose in life.  But, you’d never know it if you were to meet me.    

Every now and again I offer someone $100 to talk to me on the phone - yeah, that’s kind of pathetic - but likely safer than taking drugs.   Not that I’d ever want to take drugs.   Just saying there are more precarious ways to live and waste money.     

Thing is - my ability to form relationships just isn’t there.  I blame my early life - mostly concerned with raising myself, surviving and gaining the edge that I had always felt was mine.   I got it.   I got nothing."
2752,depression,Tonight is normal,"My normal has twisted so much, a normal night for me constitutes of being lonely and melancholic and wishing I had someone with me, while dreading my own existence and awake hours.
I feel like I'm a hopeless person and no one will ever love me, never hug me, embrace me, cuddle with me, want to spend time with me. I feel like I'm dying as alone and as sad and lonely as I am now, there is no hope, no closure, no light at the end of the tunnel, and no light or good ending for me, as this is real life, and things are just happening, there is no good waiting for me, there is only perpetual and continuous suffering"
2753,depression,I feel like I don't have any options,"On one hand, I'm terrified about failing the entrance exam to the grad program I want to apply to. I was banking on it in order to be able to move out from my parents house especially when I was always told that I wouldn't be able to score high enough. It's not a matter of re-applying. I know myself, and I'd rather just be dead than fail. Similarly, I've just been thinking about running away to avoid taking it. I know it's not sustainable, but a huge part of the above is that I'm tired of living my life. I hate it here in my hometown, I don't have any friends, this was my only chance to move out. It doesn't help that I'm depressed to the point where I more or less am ok with laying down on the floor and crying. I don't know what to do and I'm really scared about messing up."
2754,depression,Yer Blues,"i dont know anymore, im only alive for two people at this point and i love them both alot but its getting to much for me to bear anymore, i just feel like the lyrics to the song fit perfctly ""so lonely, wanna die"""

2756,depression,"Cant shake this low, just wanna get out of my head","I just want people to know I exist. I want people to know I felt what I felt and saw what I saw. But I also dont want to feel this way either because it's so intense. My emotions feel so dangerous and unsafe to me because in the past when I let myself feel these things I'd end up in the hospital because my brain just couldnt take it anymore. I know repressing isnt the right way to go and I cant tell you how badly I want to have good relationships with people without feeling that heavy elephant in the room that is my recent diagnosis. I know I need to tell people but I dont even know where to begin. I chatted with a childhood friend today and it was weird because we were talking about places to camp. It was hard and weird because the thoughts that went through my head were things like ""that's the place that person takes to murder people."" Or ""that's where the downward spiral that led to my ptsd started."" Shit like that. And what can I say? It's just weird to say shit like that to your childhood friend. But it's still what I've heard, what I know, what I've been through. But what can I tell people? How do I deal with these emotions and the darkness that surrounded me these past two years? How do I get back to the happy upbeat friendly person I used to be before ptsd? How do I pull myself out of this low? It's been a long time. I want you guys to know that I exist, that the feelings I have exist, even if I'm trying really hard to get rid of them, and that what I went through fucked me up. 
Also, I dont even know how many times I've left and rejoined this group. Am I the only one? ""I'm good! I dont need to follow this page!"" ""Ah, nevermind, turns out I'm not all better just after going on SSRI's."""
2757,depression,I ruined my life,"This is as unique as it gets for many of you but here it goes.

So, as a kid I wasn't great at anything but had potential. My dad was basketball pro (he actually played division 1 bball) and well I had some talent. Anyways life was great till age 16 no mental health problems even close to me and I did everything normal till I finally got laid and it was a long time coming but I was confident anyways yenno girl was hot and we did it then her period blood got on my hands. I was young and naive and well right away I told my friend and the idiot he is like me he got scared saying I had hiv and what not. So, for 3 months I dealt with anxiety of having hiv and all. i researched endlessly every night I literally prayed and researched and all signs were always pointing in me having the virus. I was kinda convinced I had it. As a result I Didn't eat at all and eventually lost so much weight. 

My hell ended luckily when I found out there is a clinic just to do testing and all. After I went and nervous few days of getting test back they came back negative. Life great right? Wrong apparently being stressed for 5 month straight was too much and I would literally get anxiety in every situation after developing a stomach issues cause of all this cause anxeria or smt (pree much something related to the stomach and I can't eat anything with gluten(pree much everything I LIKE or I have to shit)

Anyways I would somewhat fix myself due to a summer break after high school but I couldn't fix my body. I wouldn't ever get to play sports again cause my height which was peaking around the incident same like my dads did I couldn't play the sports I loved at 5'6. All the anxiety and lack of good nutrition ruined my dreams, respect and everything i had before.

When I turned 18 I couldn't get a girl to go on a date with me, got a scholarship to even the worst of schools which i would have had if it wasn't for this sh\*\*. Worst I feel everyone judging my body as weak and making fun of it is just wrong I got abs and what not I could have had a model type body if I had my height but due to one incident my whole image life is shattered.

Like it sucks I'm 23 now and all I got good memories are of when I was 14 realted to sports and girls. It sucks cause at 23 I feel i'm the ugliest in the room and shortest my life as truely gotten ruined due to one event and I don't know how to fix it. 

Like I try my best to stay positive and avoid girls and just study or play vediogames. but, I can't cause of relatives coming over and all they wana do is play sports or talk about chicks. And, those two things have taken away from me and it hurts that I end up crying every time after they go..:/"
2758,depression,How do i fix my life,"I just dont know what to do whatever I try I fail. My mom says my life we woul have been bettter if i was homeschooled since i was 9 since i was 12\~ years old an a bright child. I have no collage education I have no friends, I have nothing live for. My dad openly callled me a ""retard"" right into my face. Please tell me whats the sense of living. Everytime i think about my life is ending in suicide, i dont want to finish it as i know it would ruin  life of my mom for a lomg time, but i do not want to live anyways as i know its an agoony in my circumstances"

I obviously struggle with depression and anxiety myself. And I cant tell my husband how I feel because it just makes him feel worse. I feel like I have to be ""on"" 24/7 between my work and home. I used to be able to talk to my husband about how I'm feeling but now he just takes everything personally. I feel like I'm getting care giver fatigue. I'm so tired and lost. I dont know how to help my husband and I dont know how much longer I can keep going like this. I'm majorly burned out. I dont know what to do anymore."

2761,depression,Tale of a depressed doctor,"Hello, after years and years of yearning and hard work I finally graduated med school in 2018 and completed one year of mandatory internship by 2019. I’ve always been extremely shy but during my first year in Ned school my shyness converted into severe anxiety and I spent first year in new school in sheer fear and anxiousness and awkwardness. I had no friends for better part of one year at my med school and was utterly devastated. But finally I gathered courage and went to one of our teachers(doctor) for help. He prescribed SSRIs and after couple of months I get better and made friends and life was normal till graduation. During that time I was using SSRIs on/off but by the end of my internship I became depressed and anxious at the same time. And since end of my internship and my dream of becoming a doctor getting real I am not able to work as doctor. I apply for jobs at hospitals, get the job but during my first day I become severely anxious at work and do not go the next day! That’s right I just quit, the desire to fight my fears is gone completely, I am completely and desperately hopeless. I don’t go out of my house, I fear people, I fear their judgements, I fear their anger, I fear the unknowns, I hate that I sweat so much I hate that I my heart starts pounding every time I am in a social interaction.
I also have anger issues and commitment issues as well and increased sexual drive that I hate.
So even if I want to go and join a job I cannot.
Thinking of starting the SSRIs again but they ducking make me a maniac and take away all my concentration abilities."

2763,depression,A failing marriage,"I (24f) have been married to my partner(36m) for a but over a year and im not sure i love him anymore.   Three months before our wedding he changed a bit. I thought it was stress.  He dsnt really hang out with me anymore and alot of the stuff we used to do together we dont anymore.  He dsnt do alot around the house either.  He mostly just games, works, or sleeps.  Iv been struggling really hard and had a recent attempt and ended up doing a partial hospitalization program.  He hadnt even noticed i was spiraling.  When i try to talk to him he dsnt know wat to do or say.  It doesnt help.  So when that happend he was upset that my bff(27m)  knew alot more than him. Around this time things got more complicated as well. My bff is also my roomate and i have a slight crush on him.  It makes me feel guilty and disgusting because i want to feel these feelings for my partner but i cant seem to anymore. And i also dont want feelings for my bff, its confusing.  My bff has been very supportive of me.  He notices when im having a hard time and always puts in an effort to cheer me up. My husband barely looks at me unless he is tryna get in my pants.

2765,depression,What do you do when distracting yourself doesn't work anymore?,[removed]
2766,depression,I don’t really know what’s happening,"So I guess I’m not diagnosed with depression but I’m sure I have it, or had idk. Anyway a couple weeks ago I got a girlfriend and it’s made me kinda like feel again, but in a very strange way, almost like a limbo state definitely not myself like I was like 5 years ago but not super depressed Either just a strange limbo state and I guess what I am asking is has anybody else had this kinda feeling? I just want help."
2767,depression,It's been two years since I've last posted here and nothing has gotten better,"I'm 14 now. It's been so hard these last few months.

I've gotten in many altercations with my parents. They make me feel really bad about myself sometimes. They say they want the best for me but then proceed to physically hit me multiple times and downplay my wins.

I understand that I can constantly improve, but I don't see why they only focus on my negatives.

My high school that I'm going to be attending has two schooling options: independent study or online class learning. I told my parents that I would specifically like doing independent study so that I can work at my own pace and have more freedom. However, without even telling me, they had already signed me up for online classes.

They told me that I wasn't responsible enough, I can't even take showers when I'm told (even though you're scientifically not even supposed to every day), I won't be able to do it because I'm gonna get stuck at one point and need help, etc.

They always point out my flaws and don't ever make me feel better about them. I get like one pimple a month and they're always saying it makes me ugly and stuff like that. And then they basically pin me down to pop it. (EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO.)

They essentially think I'm stupid or ""have no structure in my life."" It's also like they don't realize I'm at the top of my class and have essentially had perfect attendance since fifth grade... It's just like they don't even realize the positives about me.

My parents are always telling me to respect them and they can't even do the same to me. They think it's a double standard because ""they're the adults and I'm the kid."" I do love them, but sometimes I just don't know...

There are other things going on in my life too that make me feel really down. Like, one of my friends gets a lot of what he wants when he asks his parents. I know parents shouldn't just buy everything you want, but he even has his own credit card. And to my knowledge, it always seems like he gets $20 fairly often. I'm lucky if I get that amount of money in a year.

I'm very aware that I should not get everything I want, and maybe my friend is an extreme example. But whenever I ask my parents for something, they like to guilt trip me. I'll ask for something and then they'll bring up how I accidentally broke a mirror when I was like 7 or something. And how I can't even respect my stuff or them.

I feel as if I should just be happy with the essentials they provide me. They provide me with even more. This post might even make me seem spoiled (because it's somewhat true, I mean, some of these are the most First World problems). I think it's their mental (and sometimes) physical abuse towards me that makes me realize that they are not providing the safest and most logical way to ""teach me.""

It's honestly just so unfair that people like me are born in poorer families. I know my parents try their best, but in the end I never asked to be born. And sometimes I never wanted to be."
2768,depression,Rant ig,"I’m tired. 

I’m being crept on by thoughts of my abusive ex, how she emotionally manipulated and abused me, how she would sometimes physically hurt me, how she said she loved me and left me multiple times just to keep me there on her strings. 

What if she didn’t love me, what if no one does. They all just act like it. 

I’m never the first person people think of. Everyone hangs out and I’m just here depressed. My friends tell me all of the fun they had with plans I was supposed to be included on.

My parents may or may not have lied. Both of them would say the other did wrong and then the other would say they’re wrong and would tell me bad things they did to me. 

I don’t wanna trust anyone, the more I do the more I’ll get hurt.

I don’t know what to say anymore on this. I feel like there’s so much, but I can’t accumulate the words. 

Whether it be a bullet or 19 shots of tequila, I’ll forget the pain.

Hopefully someone will show me the love and affection I need to feel better. 

My mental health isn’t ever going to get better. 

I’ve planned my future too many times to want to actually want to even have a future anymore. 

I’m tired"
2769,depression,"No matter how far down I fall, it always seems to get worse. Shouldnt I eventually hit bottom?","I was suicidal at age 20, or at least I *thought* I was. 10 years later, I found out depression has no ""worst"", it somehow finds new and more horrifying levels of suffering. Even if I get help, what chance do I ever have of climbing back out of an infinitely deep hole with no bottom to start from?"
2770,depression,Urgent: where can i find therapy,"I cant handle myself anymore and i told myself for 3 years straight that maybe next year i would finally snap and pass on.
Idrk why im trying but if anyone has some good websites to check out thats not betterhelp or talkspace thatd be great. I really really need it right now. Help.
I know i can just google it but i want to know if theres pitfalls i dont know. Ive never found therapy besides the one i had in school and she was amazing but i cant contact her"
2771,depression,2am meltdown,"Using a throwaway for reasons. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense. It’s 2:35am right now and all I want to do is sleep but my emotions are exploding. 

My sleep schedule is all off right now which is a huge depression trigger for me. On top of that, I have MDD with mixed features. My lows are LOW, and I think I’m falling into that right now. 

I hit a wall yesterday. Someone I knew from high so is the kind of person who is never single and has been engaged about 4 times. She just got engaged to her newest guy and it made something snap. I just felt... empty. 

I was doing better today until I laid down to go to bed. The only person who ever said they loved me was one of the shittiest people I’ve ever met, and that was pushing 10 years ago. I’ll be 28 soon, and I feel like there’s something wrong with me. 

I don’t think I’m necessarily even upset about like “oh, I don’t have a boyfriend, waaaah”. It’s more I want someone to actually want to be with me and love me."
2772,depression,why dose it feel fake,"When I think of depression or when I cut I feel like I am faking it. I know i'm not faking it but it just feels that way, when I try to block it out I just start cutting/feeling depressed again."
2773,depression,I feel my soul heavy,"I feel so sad, I don’t even know what to do to feel better
Nothing works
I have intrusive thoughts all the time
I feel like no one gives a shit about me and no one understand how I feel
So I never express my feelings with anyone because I feel ashamed and embarrassed 
I just wish that everything from my mind would dissaper, all this useless stress is eating me daily
I am not good enough 
I have a bf now but I have trust issues from past experiences and I am scared that he will run away if I open my soul, I am just scared to talk and to express my own feelings 
I don’t even know why I posted this, I think I just need an advice..I don’t know ..."
2774,depression,I did it again and I’m so mad at myself,I was only a week clean. I was literally only a week clean. I relapsed again. I couldn’t fucking help it. Everything is so much and I’ve never considered myself suicidal but sometimes I just wish I was gone
2775,depression,Talking to myself,"Life feels like a party I ended up at because a friend drove me there without asking. I don't know anyone. I want to, but the faces and body language say there's no room. Small talk is painful but I'm afraid to open up to anything deeper despite how badly I want it. I know it's pointless to ask for reciprocity. People either will or they won't. When someone forgets my name while I remember their favorite movie from our first conversation, I die a little inside.

I struggle to trust, but when I do, I trust the wrong people. Every burst of emotion that escapes I want to take back the moment it slips out. The more people know about me the less comfortable I feel. I want to disappear, go far away where no one knows me, but eventually the loneliness will catch up with me again. My problems feel insignificant. It's pathetic to turn over a single meaningless interaction in my head until I'm sick of existing but I can't help it. 

What is it like to live without ghosts dragging you down? At least people can see a broken arm. When your brain is broken it doesn't compute. Shape up. You're fine. I want to be okay by myself, but I can't stop hoping that this time will be different, and I'll have that moment that lets me tell someone else with confidence later on that it gets better.

I'm afraid of being someone who knows that it won't."
2776,depression,"I was ready to leave, now I can't","Everything was ok until she appeared, i don't want to continue with this ""life"" and i was ready to do it. But now we are a couple, at least now i have someone to disappoint, someone to make feel sad with my death. 

I love her and she could be my one and only reason to live, but there are a couple more reasons to be death, my past cannot be fixed and my personality, my life is destroyed. I don't want to pollute her with all of this but im not strong enough to leave her in both ways, I don't want to hurt her or make her feel sad. I love her and i should be happy but im not, its even more painful, but at least its a double edge weapon. I wish she could cheat on me and hurt my feelings so i get another reason to leave and hopefully the strength i need to do it."
2777,depression,Depression is feeling completely disconnected from everything and everyone.,"It’s not “being sad.” 

I don’t know how to form connections with others anymore and I don’t know how to enjoy things that used to make me happy. All I wanna do is fucking sleep. I just have no desire to do anything else. 

How do I fix myself"

2779,depression,I thought I got over depression but here i go again,"After 10 months I'm depressed again. I tried so hard to get over depression and i achieved but now it's happening again. I thought I've evolved, I've become a new woman, I've felt so strong than ever but now i feel very miserable, weak and lonely again. I let down myself. I thought i would be that weak woman ever again but  I'm here that point. When i close my eyes I see that scene I'm cutting my wrists. I'm tired too tired. It feels like i won't be able really happy in my life. Depression is like a old enemy to me never stops chasing me. It hurts my soul, my mind."
2780,depression,Why do I always fail?,"So, my whole life I've never quite fit in, I've been very misunderstood. I was always weird, but until my late teens, I was very kind.

I was very kind, but I got bullied and humiliated in front of people all the time. At school, at work. People just didn't like me. Maybe the combination of me being weird (which probably made me unlikable) and being nice (which made me an easy target.)

I even tried to fit in. I've always tried, but in Highschool I tried REALLY hard. Still, every part of me was picked apart. How I talked, how I walked, every single flaw in my looks from head to toe.


This even happened in public. I went to a New Year's gathering, and while everyone was saying ""Happy New Year's"" to each other, I tried and everyone ignored me. I even made tried with someone who had just congratulated someone else. I made eye contact, smiled and said ""Happy New Year's!"" And they looked at me for a second, but then sort of looked ahead of me to and ignored me. Not even their expression changed.

I noticed that all the people that bullied me and ignored me had friends. They would make a joke about me in front of the whole room, and everyone would laugh or just awkwardly stay quiet.

Well, by 18, I had become sick of this. So everytime someone tried to bully me at school, I bullied them back. I cursed them, called them fat, ugly, stupid pieces of shit, etc.

And guess what happened? I got in trouble with teachers, and people started calling me ""mean, rude, and a bitch.""

So, people can criticize me and pick me apart, to the point where I developed bipolar because I cried every night, and was just fucked with throughout the years.

When the ""bullies"" said shit to me, and treated me badly, people would laugh, and teachers would ignore it.

But when I started fighting back, I became the ""bad guy"" ""the bully"" and got scolded by the teachers.

Well now, I'm out of school. And I'm nice to everyone who's nice to me, and insult anyone who treats me like shit.

But again, when I defend myself by insulting them back, I'm ""rude, mean, sensitive, too angry"" etc. But the people who put me down are never in the wrong.

Because they're more ""likeable"" and probably because in all honesty they're more attractive. I look like shit.


So if I'm nice and let people walk all over me, hold in my feelings, and cry into my pillow at night I fail.

When I fight back, I fail.

Was I just born to be hated and shit on by everyone forever?"
2781,depression,Am I dead?,"When does a person die actually. Is it when our soul manages to escape from our bodies or when we loose the will to live. Ever since I did wrong by someone I love, I don't feel good. It's almost been more than a year and all I can think of is how badly I treated them. Since that time I've been trying to numb myself with weed and alcohol. I've dropped outta college and my future doesn't promise much other than failure. I often think of doing the obvious but I'm not strong enough to do so. Everyday it feels like a heavy object is weighing me down. I can't talk about this with anyone (not much of an extrovert). I have no ambition and all that I used to be is lost within myself. I wake up with an heavy heart and I passout drunk and stoned. Many a times I think to myself I should start living again. So as of now am I alive or am I dead."
2782,depression,Light human contact.,"Sometimes I just want someone to understand enough that they silently brush my hair and help with the damaged scalp.

 Just want 5 minutes of your time."
2783,depression,People say they ‘care’ but no one wants to listen to me,"I have my parents, an ex bf, and some people I play video games with. I’m at the end of my road and have been for the last 8 months. I’ve seen two therapists in the past two months and after the first session with both and both times they said they’d call me back to schedule a second (and third for one) and they never did. I made it very clear that I can’t do this for much longer. Every time I talk to anyone and I start to open up about how much I’m struggling they either change the subject or just give me a quick ‘you just need to relax’ or some platitude. I feel like I’ve reached out to professionals and I just feel like they didn’t seem concerned. People say they care, but they don’t even give me 1 minute to talk about my feelings. I need help and I don’t know what to do."
2784,depression,Bedtime,"My most hated and most loved time of the day. My most loved because I get to sleep which is generally peaceful. There’s also a chance you may not wake up. A very low one, but you never know.

My most hated because I know tomorrow will come. Sleep is great but it’s always over so quick and before you know it, the next day is here. Another day I have to somehow get through despite feeling absolutely horrible."
2785,depression,What's the point?,"I've wanted to die for as long as I can remember, and depressed for longer. I have been diagnosed with MDD and tried counselling and meds for almost 2 years. Neither worked, my counselor told me that this doesn't work for everyone and I'm probably one of those people. my doctor told me meds aren't for everyone and I'm probably one of those people. The only other treatment that Ive been recommended to is basically the same stuff but in a group.My condition has no cure and the treatments dont work for me.

If were all gonna die eventually and my life has been and will be nothing but suffering, why shouldn't I end it?"
2786,depression,"Physically and mentally exhausted, I'm breaking down into uncontrollable tears multiple times a week","Every step I seem to take forward in life just pushes me further into feeling stuck and wanting to kill myself. I have little to nothing to look forward to, I'm only alive to not hurt people around me who really only take me for granted. I'm so tired of all the negativity and anger, I'm just so tired of everything. I've been mentally exhausted for years, easily almost a decade of this shit but my new job is also physically exhausting and it just makes me feel weak and useless.

I'm not a priority to anyone, I feel like I just exist, I'm background noise. I'm so damn boring and irredeemable, I'm convinced majority of people will have a better life without me around.

I know I'm just yelling into the void, nobody cares and why should strangers on the internet care about some self pitying loser anyway.

I just wish I felt loved and cherished, I wish people noticed me and went out of their way for me. I feel so empty and fake, I can't even tell if I'm a real person some days. Can't even get my girlfriend to care because I feel like I'm manipulating her whenever I get overly depressive. 

But the physical exhaustion is what is breaking me, I can't even walk without it hurting by the end of the work day. It's been a month and hasn't really improved, I'm miserable but really need this job. I always feel so stuck."
2787,depression,I lost my cat and now I feel like I’m lost in the world,"My cat (Ms. Kitty) was my companion for 21 years. I got her when she was 6 weeks old, I was 4 years old. 

We literally grew up together, I can barely remember a time in my life she wasn’t there. And now, now I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I lost my sister, like a part of me is just gone. My face hurts from the crying I’ve been doing all day.

I had to make the decision to put her down on Sunday night, July 5th, in the emergency vet at 11:30pm. A polyp had developed in her throat and swelled up so large she was unable to breathe on her own. I felt like I failed her, like if I had caught this sooner and let her stay with my mom instead of bringing her with me when I moved— she would still be here.

She died “comfortably,” but god, I hate myself. I know she was suffering and I would give anything to have been able to take that away from her. 

I can’t feel much of anything right now. Just pain. Just sadness. My fiancé has been trying to encourage me to get a memorial tattoo, have her portrait done, make a memento of her, get a gravestone for where we buried her, get to the animal shelter, spend time at a cat cafe— I just want to hide in bed. I know she means well, but I just don’t process things like she does. 

I cried so much last night and this morning I gave myself a migraine, threw up medicine I took for the migraine, which left a horrible taste in my mouth and burned for *hours* and I’m still not able to taste much of anything. Idk if it’s my sadness, my tongue, if I’m making myself sick, if I’ve just been eating shitty food— I don’t know. All of the water I’ve been drinking I’m sure has gone to my tears. I can’t sleep. I can’t call off work again...

I love cats, I’ve always loved cats— to a point it’s part of my identity people know me as the girl who loves cats— I have for a long time fostered kittens, my fiancé jokes that I am a cat in a human body, I have ticks where I meow for fucks sake and now looking at a cat makes me sob, I can’t even think of getting another cat. I feel like my heart has fallen out of me.

I know it’s only been a day, but.. I just don’t see an end in sight for this grief.. it feels insurmountable and I don’t know how to cope with this at all, I don’t know how to even try to feel better."

2790,depression,I don't know how to help my sister,"Some background: I'm 20 and in college (far away), and she's 17 and still at home (although I'm at home right now due to covid). I've struggled with mental health before (anxiety, eating disorder, etc), but never to the extent she has. When she was 14, she attempted suicide, and since then, has been on and off several different medications and seen several different therapists. She seems a bit better, but she still is struggling a lot. 

Recently, there have been several times where she came to me crying and talking about how she didn't think she was ever going to be happy again. I try to be there for her, but I don't know if it makes a difference. Personally, medication and therapy made a huge difference for me, but she's tried those (and is continuing to try new things), so I don't know if there's anything that will help. I know high school is a rough time and I've told her things will probably get better when she goes to college (they did for me), but I'm afraid it's not true. I'm scared of what will happen if things don't get better, and if she'll reach a breaking point and try suicide again. I want to be there for her and reassure her that it'll be okay but I don't know how - or if they will. 

Any advice would be very much appreciated."

I feel like I just want things to come easy and that make me disgusted with myself. I feel so fucking sad and it pisses me off. Sometimes I cry myself to sleep and that pisses me off because I feel like I’m a guy I shouldn’t be so sensitive but I feel so shitty and just feel so stuck I can’t stand it.
I’m sorry you had to hear all of this I just feel like I can’t just bottle my shit up like everyone else I know does.

2800,depression,High Functioning depression is so confusing,Especially when it comes to academics. Being a perfectionist with depression is exhausting. Your mind convinces itself that your illness isn’t real because you’re able to get through your day but you’re also so dead on the inside????
2801,depression,Every thing I do is exhausting,"I’m high functioning bipolar 2, currently in deep depression. Everything is falling apart, 3 jobs, independent living, maintaining psych, therapy, a rescue dog....

2802,depression,"Not sure what to do, I guess I need a girlfriend.","I just graduated high school, and am in a place of major growth and reflection. At night I think about things and that tends to lead down the same avenues. I’m a depressed kid, about to be an adult, and I recently quit smoking weed in order to join the military. In these first two weeks of being clean I have remembered how shit sobriety is for me. I truly am depressed beyond any life situation or mentality, it is hereditary and I fight it every day. I smoked weed just about every single day, multiple times a day for a little over three years. I realize now all of the bad things weed does, but it gave me sleep where I otherwise do not. It gave me the ability to relax. It kept me from suicidal thoughts. Its really important that I don’t pick it up again, but I absolutely cannot go back to living this way. What is the point of the “straight and narrow” if I want to die doing it? Sometimes I think a girlfriend would help, but past experiences and my introverted nature make me hesitant to even try. I know many people are just as fucked as I am mentally, and would appreciate any words of wisdom. I don’t have any expectations. I just need an outlet."

2805,depression,"I'm sleeping on the floor in another room, and it's my fault.","Unfortunately, the way I was brought up has turned me into feeling inadequate and unworthy. I hate this, and I'm trying to change it. It doesn't help I have depression, anxiety, and more either, but I'm getting help and have been making progress.

Some truths were brought to light in an argument I had with my significant other (SO). They brought up how I make them feel like shit and it happens all the time. This seems to come up when I tell them how they made me feel, which is usually hurt or something negative. But it also happens when I snap and can't handle anything. Essentially, I blow up.

Well now I feel even worse about myself. I can't even bring myself to sleep in the same bed as my SO. So here I am sleeping on my yoga mat in the spare bedroom. It's only my fault at this point, and I just feel like my depressive thoughts only confirm I'm a burden. I don't deserve being with my SO nor do I deserve the life I have. That's all I keep thinking.

2806,depression,Can a toxic friendship traumatize you?,"i went through a pretty toxic friendship a few months back. i didn’t realize it during the time, but i guess it messed with my mind a good bit. there was a lot involved with being left out, lied to, ignored, treated differently, and more. i’ve been depressed for a while, and the ending of this friendship took a pretty big toll on me as well. memories of our arguments/events that made me feel left out have always been making me have breakdowns and cry and miss this friend. during these moments, i feel so hopeless and just want to be happy. i’m not sure if these feelings are because of the “breakup” or because of how i was treated during the friendship. it has scarred me a good bit and i’m always scared of messing up while interacting with the few friends i have left. i want to keep talking to them, but i also just want to stay away from everyone. i can’t stop replaying these thoughts in my head. do you think i might be traumatized? is this trauma? i’m not a professional and i won’t see my therapist for a bit so i just wanted to check what other people thought. if you read through all this, thank you so much for doing so! it really means a lot :)"
2807,depression,Death and long distance friendships.,One of my long time WoW friends died unexpectedly today. I feel sad I didn't try harder to stay close. Life has just been insane lately. Now I will never speak to him again. Honestly some of my online friendships have been more wholesome than my real life ones.
2808,depression,It gets worse...,"I've always been told from a young age that things would get better. I assumed once I was an adult I would have processed and healed from all the shit I've been through. I thought I'd finally want to live, and would be able to escape the things that were destroying me... I'd seen others heal and have a life around me, and I'd held onto the hope it'll happen for me too... I was wrong... It gets worse... I'm a type of broken that can't be mended, and I'm trying to make peace with that..."
2809,depression,Having a human body is exhausting,"Like I just ate a few hours ago. why do I have to eat food AGAIN ?

I constantly need water or my internal organs will dry up like a rasin.

 I only go a day or two without bathing before I look and smell like a disgusting wild animal.

I need sunlight, but not too much or I'll burn like a vampire.

Why is having a human body so much work? I hate it..."
2810,depression,I hope it gets better,"I just kinda hit a wall tonight. I'm mostly a happy go lucky type, not many people would look at me and realize how commonly I am ravaged by depressive episodes. 

I'm pretty high functioning, I think. I keep a smile on my face and am personable and funny with the people I interact with. My girlfriend knows I occasionally have ""blue days"" but doesn't know how truly I hurt. 

I understand that I'm not the main character, I will never receive a call to adventure, have luck smile upon me and send me on an adventure I can tell my children and grandchildren one day. I work a minimum wage job and live in a shitty apartment i can only afford by splitting rent with my girlfriend. But although she tells me daily she loves me I don't always feel that way. I feel like shes going to lose interest any day and one of the only people in my life are going to be gone.

I'm not special. I'm not extraordinary. I'm just me and that depresses the he'll out of me. I get home every day and just want to collapse. 

I don't know what I want out of this post. I'm mostly just ranting because I'll only ever be able to do it here I'm afraid."

2813,depression,does it get better,"i know my situation isn't as bad as many others here, and thus my heart goes out to you all. 

after a 4-5 month battle with violent, aggressive cancer, my dad passed away in september 2019. i have felt empty since then. i feel nothing like i used to. sure, occasionally i get a little pip of excitement, or a tiny bit of happy or anything positive. i usually just feel sad to my core. i feel it in my bones. grief, sorrow, anger. 

just over a year ago it all started. it feels like yesterday. i never got to grieve. i got a week out of school, because apparently my grades matter more than my mental health, even after the traumatic loss i had suffered just the day before. not a day goes by where i don't miss him and it hurts so much. it hurts so goddamn much. 

i tried to recreate a meal that him and my mom used to make me when i was about 7 or 8, i think? can't remember the age exactly. it came out badly. i fucked up a main part of it and i tried over and over but by the time it was somewhat ""okay"" the food got cold and it wasn't even worth eating. i ate it anyways and i fucking regret it.

i don't want to live anymore if he isn't here"
2814,depression,stupid idiot,"As a kid you always think that everythings gonna be the greatest and you’ll get everything you want and that everything will be exciting. When I was 2 I legitimately thought I could become a princess (not that I wanted to anymore when I got older). And then I realized that everything is boring as hell. It just feels like nothing is worth it unless there’s a goal to accomplish, and none of them are possible. It’s because I’m just a selfish idiot that just isn’t satisfied with anything. Graduating high school next year, and then going to a boring as hell job every day, it just isn't fulfilling and I kick myself for not appreciating everything I have because I should, I have a great life and I understand that. But theres just nothing else. I just don’t see the point. I can’t see myself ever having friends or meeting anyone because everyone just seems fake or dont care about anything except video games and Netflix shows. Its all people care about and I want nothing to do with people. Everything just bores me and I’m a complete selfish idiot that can’t enjoy the wonderful life I have and ive come to terms with the fact that I’ll only ever want what I can’t have"
2815,depression,"Nowhere to turn but it's not that bad, I exaggerate","I can't hold down a job because I hate working. I find one and either quit or get myself fired. I need therapy, but therapy usually requires insurance, and I don't have insurance because I don't stay at any job long enough to get it. There is free counseling from the university here, and I tried it once and it was good, but I worry that I'm taking the spot of someone who needs it more than I do, like if I really wanted to I could work and get my own therapist, I just don't want to. And the last time I tried to call them nobody answered. My parents have been helping me with $1,000 a month hoping I would find part time work and use the rest of the time to gain skills to get into a career I might actually enjoy. I've tried off and on to learn to code, and I mostly enjoy the learning when I do it, but I don't stick with it and then I'm constantly starting over again. Since I quit my last job against their advice my parents are frustrated with me and I don't think they're going to be willing to help me financially any more, or if they do, I'm afraid I'd be giving them too much control over my life, and the way I see it I'll be expected to look for work either way. Thinking about having to work to support myself, I wonder if I would be better off just killing myself. I also feel a little guilty since I am extremely privileged to have been able to avoid having to work just to survive when most people have no other choice. And I've been living off of other people's work, which makes me a parasite. But I think about how my suicide would affect people I'm close to and I don't want to hurt them like that. I've had friends tell me I can come to them if I need anything, but I don't feel very confident doing that. It either feels weird because I've never really talked to them about this, or I worry they'll just try to offer advice and not really hear me out and validate my feelings, which is something I have a tendency to do myself, or I don't want to burden them. And I don't want to call the suicide hotline because I worry I'll be taking time from people who need it more, especially since I don't think I'll actually kill myself, and I've worked at call centers before and I just remember how I was told to empathize with the customers, but that was harder to do the longer I worked there and the more people expected me to instantly solve problems I couldn't fix - so I imagine the suicide hotline person feeling the same way and I don't want to burden them, either. So I feel like I have no one to talk to. And even posting here I kind of think my situation isn't actually so bad, I'm just exaggerating and whining to get attention, and taking attention away from people who need it more."

I go through very high and low times. And right now I feel the lowest I have ever been. I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone I know about it. I want to talk to my SO but he won’t understand and I’m scared it will ruin our relationship if he realizes how broken I am. I have been alone the past few days. I don’t want to reach out and annoy people. I have tried to do things I enjoyed today, but it didn’t help and I felt this feeling coming and it has hit me so hard I just don’t know what to do."
2818,depression,I need help understand what mania is,"I have no idea if I have it or if it’s possible to have it on a spectrum. I have never believed I’ve had it in the past however for the last 5 years I’ve dealt with severe depression and anxiety. Anxiety more so than anything. When I get happy I have a hard time with impulse control. I recently have been feeling way too happy and I don’t know if it’s cause Im starting to get better and it’s a new feeling to me to actually like myself but I am also extremely uncomfortable. Like my bones ache in the way anxiety makes them ache, my muscles hurt, I am extremely hyper. I feel really good but sometimes in these moments if I am alone with my thoughts the happiness makes me severely uncomfortable. Like I’m too happy for my own good? Does this make sense to anyone? Or does anyone experience this?"
2819,depression,Envious of people who have their lives sorted,"I have put in a lot of effort into not comparing myself to others. 

But on some bad days, I would ccidentally come across the social media (FB/LinkedIn) profiles of some old acquaintances. It reminded me of how we had been classmates in the same school but we turned out so differently.

Here I am, quitting my job due to depression and struggling to stay in the game by taking online courses. Tired most of the time. 

Then there would be some other people who went on to score top distinctions in A-levels, got enrolled in top institutions and secured entry level positions at top firms. Not to mention that they're good looking, fit and have like multiple certifications in piano, violin, ballet etc etc. Makes you wonder how they did it. 

Those people plan the next steps of their career. My goal is to stay alive. I know I'm a disappointment and it's really sad to see how I've turned out."
2820,depression,Help please. How can I tell if I have depression? I don’t want to be alive?,"To whoever reads all of this, thank you for listening to me ramble. 

Let me start by saying I’ve been feeling this way for over a year now.

Every day I wake up I wish I didn’t, I’m just so tired all of the time I’ve stopped participating in things I enjoy. They just seem like they’re not worth it anymore, like it just doesn’t matter anymore to me. 

Things have only gotten worse since the end of the school year. I’ve always been a straight A student, I’ve never really had many friends but that hasn’t bothered me. I used to enjoy being alone. But now it’s like I don’t enjoy it when I’m alone or around people. I want them to go away but I also want a hug and it hurts so much. I’m so lonely all of the time and have nobody to turn to.

I failed two classes and have to retake them. My parents yelled at me severely and since then have called me a disappointment and a failure multiple times. They have also stated I am lazy and do nothing but lay in bed, and the thing is they’re not wrong. 

I am a failure, and a dissapointent. But I can’t get it off my mind that my grades wouldn’t matter if I died next week, or if I was dead tomorrow. I’d be free if I was. I don’t even have anyone that would really miss me, no pets, just my family. And all they do is yell and put me down anyways so what would it matter. 

I know if I told my parents about this they would only yell at me more, saying I have mental issues and that non of my other siblings were like this. And if I told another adult they’d just tell my parents. So I have nobody to turn to but friends (I currrently only have one who ever wants to willing talk to me) . I’ve tried talking to my friend and she listens but it never makes me feel better. It just makes me feel anxious and annoyed like I want to rip my hair out and yell at her. She keeps telling me to just hang in there things will get better but nothings changed at all and I’m starting to think it never will. 

All those comments people make about how it will get better just make me so angry and I don’t know why. I don’t even know why this started in the first place. It’s not like I had a traumatic childhood, it was fun and I was treated well. I just can’t take it anymore, this feeling of being so pathetic and empty and useless. 

I’m so tired, physically and mentally. I see no future for myself anymore. 

What should I do? I am desperate please, if I can’t find an answer soon I’m scared I won’t be able to convince myself not to do it. I don’t even know if I’m depressed because I’ve never been diagnosed and I can’t tell anyone about this. 

Is this normal? I’m afraid I’m just faking it or it’s all in my head someone please give me some guidance."
2821,depression,I just want to be stronger,I know I can do it on my own. Yet I still don’t feel strong enough. Even if things get better for me. Like becoming a supervisor at my job. Every night before I go to sleep I end up clenching my fist and cry because I can do much better than this.
2822,depression,Sometimes therapy just reminds me of the bad thing,"And talking about the bag things don’t help after you’ve already gone over them a thousand times. Sometimes I think therapy just teaches us to be complacent with the situation we’re in, when what really needs to happen is a change in the situation to find and let go of the things that make us sad.

 Not in every case, but in some, definitely, I think that therapy just reinforces how to tolerate a bad situation instead of fix it."
2823,depression,My daughter is the only reason I’m still here,"I would’ve ended this awhile ago if it wasn’t for her. She’s only 4 and she’s what keeps me going. Not that I don’t think about it still, I do. Multiple times a day I think about just ending it all. I never will, I couldn’t do that to her. She probably wouldn’t really remember me but she needs a good role model in her life and she’s not getting that from her mom.

Just ended an 11yr relationship with her mom, we were married for 9 of those years. She cheated on me once, about three years ago, it destroyed my whole world. You go from knowing everything about this person to seeing them as a stranger overnight. It’s hard to explain. We reconciled and then a couple of months ago I caught her flirting with ANOTHER guy online, it ended with phone numbers being exchanged. I couldn’t believe it... not again. I was so against the “once a cheater always a cheater” line. I had just learned to trust her again. My whole adult life, every memory is now a painful one. The fact that we went through the work of getting over the affair makes it so much worse. It opened up that wound that was almost healed.

My birthday and Father’s Day were on the same weekend, a month after it all went down. My birthday was easily one of the worst days of my life. I’ve been through it all, all the counseling, people saying it’s not my fault, etc.. I know it’s not. That still doesn’t make it any less painful. It still doesn’t stop you from wondering what you could have done to change things. Coming in second place to some stranger in the eyes of the one person you thought you could trust, the one person you thought you’d be with for the rest of your life... It’s the worst feeling in the world.  It eats at me every day. I used to be so happy, so easygoing. I was one of those people who thought depression was just a bullshit excuse for stress and for companies to sell their prescriptions."
2824,depression,I will die soon.,"My heart is weak. I've given it my all for so long to no avail.
WONDERING why? I can see everything written and hear all that is said. 
Time and space feel irrelevant. I'm a loser. Schmuck. Worthless human being, in a long line of ones that came before me.
I tried, I failed.
Nonviolence is my only source of Joy.
Do no harm, you do not matter.
Life is everlasting. Protect the innocent.
We all can relate to the ways life can cause pain.
Nothing is fair. Go on, live.
Make the next day bearable.
After bearable it forms into decent.
After decent it may become content.
I am 29 years of age and feel like a lifetime has passed me by.
I will not apologize for who I am. I will not bring sadness to others.
I wish for a peaceful world.
Yet that is not what I see."
2825,depression,lost my intelligence,"so ive been struggling with depression over many years now, it has taken a heavy toll on my cognitive functioning. i am not at all sharp or quick witted. i cant seem to think straight or make any decisions. now, over the past three years when i had gone long periods of time in complete isolation doing nothing but lying down in bed and rotting because i lack the motivation to do anything thanks to depression, my mind seems to function at an excruciatingly slow pace; i just cant seem to think; process information; think critically or form opinions; my comprehension just isnt there. also lets not forget how fucking hard it is to put together a coherent sentence; whenever i try to speak i sound like a complete retard. i seriously cant even talk in complete sentences and my brain is super slow. my memory also got affected; i had painful chronic headaches to accompany this cognitive decline. i also find it hard to grasp jokes and even sarcasm or atleast it takes me a while due to my inability to think having lost my comprehension. lets not forget how hard it is to hold a normal conversation. its killing me that i am struggling in school and i have this condition to fully account for my poor academic performance and inability to quickly learn or grasp new information.

ive had my iq evaluated by a psychiatrist and i came out above average with the only thing holding me back from accessing my true potential being severe ADHD; depression; and anxiety."
2826,depression,ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"Soul is worn , spirit is torn. Just like eminem said.

I aint even here anymore . Cant give a fuck about anything. no one gets it. and if they do it changes nothing. life coulda been good, if i was attractive. instead, life fucked me. im alone in this shit and always will be. if i was attractive i'd have all the people in my life. funny how that works. funny how people lie and says looks don't mean much. they are delusional. Im a realist

Thats just the cherry on top though."
2827,depression,Why is depression so debilitating yet captivating?,"whenever my days get better, I'll miss my depressive episodes. whenever my depressive episodes come, I'll wish I felt better and more productive.

2829,depression,Forced Optimism &lt; Opportunistic Utilitarianism,"People who keep preaching that we ought to always look on the bright side of life trigger me.

I’m sure one can concoct a positive spin on everything, but I’m not sure that’s healthy.  

Lately I’m exploring utility over optimism.  For example, if something bad happens - I’m much more inclined to ask myself how I can use it to my advantage than to thank the heavens for blessing me with more negative events."
2830,depression,I feel like I’m not good enough and I want to give up on everything,"I am in a load of shit and am having a hard time dealing with it

I’m going through a hard time rn and idk how to deal with it. I feel like I’m never good enough and hate myself tbh. It all started with a really good friend that I was friends with for a while and then he started bullying me. He bullied me into quitting wrestling and always told me that I will never get a girlfriend and that no one likes me. I was in a really bad depression and I told him and he told me in front of my friends that no one cares and that if I wanted to I should. I cut him off but I feel like he took a piece of me when he left. I don’t miss him but he is like a constant reminder that I will never be good enough. And my parents will always treat my younger brother as superior. I expressed to my mom that my brother always is given more credit to me when I do the same thing and that I am jealous of the attention that he gets because almost everyone in my family likes him better because he wrestles. She just told him so now I’m being made fun of for that by my family. I just feel like a useless pos that will never be good enough and that I will never get a girlfriend or ill never be better than my brother. Fuck, I love sports but I’m blown off every time I talk about it but my family is all over my brother. I just want to quit everything and stop trying."

2832,depression,Too sad to even do laundry,Just realized it has been months since I've done laundry... pretty much don't leave my house and wear pjs all day. I am disgusting. My house is a mess as well and I shower only when I have to leave the house for something to be presentable. I am so disgusted with myself but have no energy or motivation to do anything. I just have piles of dirty clothes all over my room. Most I can manage is waking up and convincing myself to get out of bed. I'm ashamed I let it get like this.
2833,depression,The quarantine is taking a toll on me and it's getting worse every day,"I hadn't seen anyone in 6 months until yesterday it was the best I've felt in a while.

This summer I have been taking a class to graduate early. I've been so anxious that I can't focus and I feel like such a failure. I'm 4 days behind now. It's not like I haven't tried to do my work. I legitimately cannot focus. I'm nervous about school starting back and not being able to focus on my work.

Politics are making me anxious along with everything else going on in the world. I'm not able to sleep much anymore and I feel like I'm going crazy. 

My parents are divorced and both are remarried and I'm dealing with family stress. My step-mom is Brazilian and so is my 4 year old step sister and the cultures really clash. My step-family and Dad keep going places when we're still switching houses with my mom who has been hospitalized with breathing problems. Not to mention, I already don't get along with my parents.

I've been talking to a guy I really like, but I have commitment issues and I'll probably find a way to mess it up. I probably won't even be able to seem him for a few weeks either.

Several of my friends haven't been talking to me since quarantine, and I feel like I don't have anyone. 

I'm starting to eat less and I've already lost 8 pounds. 

I just want to be held right now. I want everything to get better so bad.

TL;DR: Being isolated with family issues and the current world is making me depressed."
2834,depression,Y'all ever just spend the night taking to online counselors because you're lonely as fuck,"Heaving suicidal thoughts for the first time in 2+ years.

2835,depression,I'm at that point again...,"15 minutes ago I was feeling perfectly fine. I was just scrolling trough Instagram, when I saw a post made my current girlfriend. 
A post clearly meant for the other person she loves. 

She says she still loves me, but she's just not attracted to me any more. All the while she's saying and posting to that other person, things she used to say and post to me. 

It crushes me, makes me hollow inside and makes me feel worthless. 

She was honest to me when she realized her feelings for that other person, what more can I ask for? 

I don't want to lose her... But it feels like I already have. 

I can't kick her out, we own a house together. 

And in a strange way... I feel like I deserve this pain. Like it's my fault. Like I've been a bad boyfriend, even though I've always tried to make her life better..."
2836,depression,Reddit's a Cesspool,"I was previously doxed, blackmailed, told to kill myself, etc. after I made an unpopular post and someone/some people decided they should dive into my post history and discovered I have PTSD.

One in particular was interesting and considering that every goddamn thing in the world is closed down because of COVID and apparently I'm unloved even on the internet, it caught my attention

Flip a coin

The idea's stuck with me and I've found no support whatsoever on this fucking abomination of a social media platform so I'm almost leaning towards tossing a single dice as a compromise"
2837,depression,I cheated😔,I cheated on my girlfriend and i fucking regret it i want her to know how sorry i am about everything its going to hurt like a bich
2838,depression,I really have the audacity.,"I’m boring. I’m not that active in my hobbies and interests. All I do is jump from one social media to the next, watch a show, finish it, watch another one. And I have the audacity to want to have friends?

How I made friends in the first place is a mystery. I wonder why a few of them are still in my life. I feel guilty and undeserving of them. 

Guilty because I believe I somehow forced them to stay. Undeserving because they’re all great people who have so many chances at life and just overall better than me. And while they have their own problems, they make an effort to get better. And me? I’m a lost cause."
2839,depression,Feeling numb for the first time. Anyone relate?,"I have never felt this feeling in my life. An absolute feeling on nothingness. Last week, I was crying myself to sleep every night. Now, I feel nothing. I know that I’m at my lowest point, I just don’t FEEL like I’m at my lowest point. I’m going to cut off my abusive, controlling birth family and almost everything from my old life in less than two months from now. My partner cut me off. Everything is up in the air. Nothing will ever be the same. I’m not sure how to get over this feeling of nothingness, I’m just numb to it all right now. I guess I just seek reassurance that I’m not weird or crazy and that maybe some of you could relate."
2840,depression,My mentality,"People say that you need to love yourself to love others. That was a lie. I hate myself more than anything in the world, and yet I still love  my family. That’s why they can’t know. That’s why I have to hide it. Like, they know I’m sad, but if they knew all the messed up things I think, they would be crushed. It’s just rough not having anyone to go to. At this point, it’s expected. By now, life has hit me down enough that I don’t even bother hoping for good things or help anymore. If you don’t expect good things to happen, you won’t be disappointed when they don’t. That’s my mentality. I’ve learned to live by it. I’ll probably make another post some other time going more into my mentality, and explain it in more detail. Not like anyone would listen, but whatever. I don’t care. I don’t care about anything anymore. What’s the point."
2841,depression,Happy birthday to me!,
2842,depression,I should be grateful but I’m not,"TL; DR. I’m a miserable cunt who just needs to vent 


I should be grateful for simply just “living” but that’s far from the truth. I’m miserable, I’m so sad and I hate the way I feel. I’m paralyzed with negative emotion. It hurts to smile.  It hurts to think of my future because I feel absolutely hopeless with nothing to look forward to. 

My dog. I love her to death and she’s been sick since December with a variety of issues, costing me close to $7,000.  I already live paycheck to paycheck so the stress of this is sometimes unbearable. 

My job. I hate dealing with the public. I want to punch almost half of everyone that walks into the office for just breathing. I can’t.  

My weight.  I’m such a fat pig. I’ve gained 60 pounds and I don’t even recognize myself anymore. Stupid anti depressants.  They caused this. My depression caused this.  I hate myself. 


Boyfriend. I love him but he’s selfish and I think lacks relationship maturity.  He should be with someone who doesn’t have kids who is like 25 years old. Also, someone without depression. He doesn’t get it. And when I try but to explain he tunes me out and is so absent minded, it just turns me off from wanting to share things.  I actually don’t think he truly loves me. He’s so detached and I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.  And we live together so ....I think he’s just using me for cheap rent and blow jobs. 


Guilt. I feel so damn guilty for feeling the way I do because there’s far worse in the world. The guilt of being depressed when I should be grateful weighs heavy and I don’t know that I will ever be happy. And that’s what makes me sad.  The guilt for being so negative and not seeing the positive hurts my brain. I fight with myself constantly.  I feel like I’m losing. I hate this. I hate this disease and I hate how it makes me feel. 

I miss being happy."

My brother is a piece of shit. I insured a car for the asshole, trying to be nice, and he ruins it by getting about 10 tickets, i was arrested several times. The motherfucker wont even help. I cant drive since 2013. I recently found this out when i registered and insured a car, then a boot came. I never seen the tickets my brother got and lost my car because i cant aford it. Yet when things like this happen to me im overreacting when i get angry. Mind you this motherfucker just bought a van do you think he help me with my tickets nope. I feel like a crab in a bucket and ill never make it out, i never felt so lost."
2848,depression,"When we walk out in the sunlight we tell everyone we know it hurts our eyes, when the real reason we don't like it is that it makes us wonder if we're dying.","I spend most of my days gathering willpower.  


I wake up most mornings at 5 am. The room is still dark and that eases my transition. I spend about an hour in the darkness. Often the high point of my day. It can be soothing to not have to be anything, and it's easy to be nothing when there's nothing around. I spend the next hour preparing responses to the things I might be asked that day and setting mental alarms. I need time to build the will to do what I might have to do that day. Surprises are the worst. Everything takes three times as long for me. The third hour is spent building the will to move my body out of bed. Perfectly timed, as it starts to need food at around 8 or 9. I have to make note, because I just don't really ever feel hungry anymore. Breakfast is simple. Oatmeal with vitamin supplements. Everything tastes the same, so I just try to keep my body from feeling worse. Spicy food is okay, though. The rush of dopamine is nice.   


After breakfast, I have to psych myself up to brush my teeth. Sometimes I can't work up the quota. More times than I'll admit, honestly. Work takes a lot of willpower. 

I don't actually work. My body works, and I guess I technically work, but it's not me. I watch myself work through my eyes while work me titters away with his coworkers and smiles at customers. I've never felt an ounce of feeling behind my smile. Or any smile that I can recall, really. I like to count the smiles I get per day as a sort of metric to see how good I am at playing my role. The guy who's a part of things. Lunch is always light, as I have to prepare myself to socialize in a different setting and I don't get time to do that while I'm working. Out to the car and to a different parking lot to pick up something quick that I already picked up beforehand and back. Deception, thy name is me appearing to do anything spontaneous. I know nobody cares. I just don't like people knowing what I have to do just so I can appear like them.  


The drive home is nice. Sunset is always pretty. Looking at things I know to be pretty somehow makes me feel a little better for a while. Something to occupy my time. I don't really hang out with a lot of people. I did manage to trick a girl into liking me, or the me who she thinks I am. I like her, she's very nice and very smart. We make little jokes together that I'm sure don't mean much to her, but each one is a sip from an oasis to me. It's nice to feel things sometimes. The real me is starting to ooze from the cracks in the facade, though. I can see it hurting her every time. All things must end. If anyone knows that, I know. I just wish I knew how much sand I have left.  


Dinner is as simple as breakfast is. Just fill the categories. Some protein, some fruit, a few veggies. It all goes down the same. I guess I like the different textures, though. Carrots are firm and crunchy, potatoes are firm and squishy. Beef is stringy and a bit springy. I kind of like to squish it down with my teeth and feel it fray. Chicken feels like what bread would feel like if it were made of meat. I know the textures change if you prepare them differently, but that's honestly a pretty pricey item in the willpower aisle.

I don't shower. I keep my pelvis and pits clean with baby wipes, I wash my face once per week, and my hands every 10 - 15 minutes at work, plus after bathroom visits. I don't know why self-care takes up so much willpower. I used to not even do that, but I've resolved to improve. My hair doesn't get greasy, so that's one for the ""pros"" column of my existence I guess.

I don't know how to feel connected to anything. I float through the days, blown by the wind. I'm a bag of apathy filled with ash."
2849,depression,I feel like the worst is yet to come and it scares me and makes me more sad,"Im a male 19. Im in high school and i have been suffering from depression for about 4 years. Because of my depression i have fucked up my education, im 1 year behind my age group in school and it is inevitable that it will soon become 2 years. Im fucking tierd and so sad all the time. Im ashamed of myself, i don't like myself or my appearance. I feel like a lazy piece of shit. I have a lot of ""friends"" and by that i mean people who i care about but who doesn't care about me. They are nice to me if we happen to meet them at a party or something but will never initiate a conversation on social media. My family doesn't know im depressed because i feel ashamed to show or tell them because i feel like im a weak person for it. The only reason i haven't killed myself yet is my family and my best friend who seems to be the only person who actually cares about me. But my best friend doesn't have time for me all the time because he is very popular. I cant fall asleep because of my thoughts and often fall asleep in the morning because of being so tired and i cry myself to sleep almost every day. My dad who i look up to and love often says mean things to me which makes me very sad, i know he doesn't mean anything by it he is just a little bit strict but the worst parts about it when i later think about his comments and realise that they are true... 
i am stressed almost all the time about the future. My friends will soon graduate without me and it makes me feel ashamed of myself (almost all of my friends are one year younger than me). I don't know why but i can't control it but i fake being happy and okey infront of everyone. Now back to the headline. I feel like when my friends graduate they will all drift apart from me and i have no confidence so i don't think i will make any new friend IF i make it to university or college or whatever i will do in the future. I feel like i have no real reason left to live. Btw i have been to therapy consistently for almost 2 years it just doesn't seem to help. Im addicted to porn and feel discusted with myself i would like to stop and feel love instead. Im pretty active and going to parties partly because of the short distraction it gives me from the bad thoughts and partly because of my best friends who wants me there. So its not like i don't have opportunities to meet girls. I just wanted to write this post because i wanted to get it out somewhere because like i said i cant bring myself to talk to my best friend because i always fake being fine. Im so tired of being alive and would like to kill myself and most likely will at some point"
2850,depression,Never thought I'd do this again...,I've lost all will to live. Whenever I used to feel like this i just spend some time with my dog and I'll feel better and the cycle goes on and on. This time isn't like usual. This time I'm really making plans to end this. I don't want to do it but I don't see any other way out of this mess. I am so exhausted both physically and mentally. I don't seem to enjoy anything I used to. I get annoyed easily and it's not helping my family either. I know they'd miss me but they'd be so much better off without me. I can't do this anymore.
2851,depression,I AM SO TIRED OF THE WORLD,"People doing shitty things and making the rest of the world stereotype and generalize an entire group of people because of it.

People who think they can police or control women’s bodies. 

People who think they have a right to an opinion about other people’s lives that dont affect them directly or harm anyone. 

Politicians are all corrupt.

Government are corrupt. 

Doctors are corrupt. 

Rich people are all corrupt. 

Everyone is selfish. Everyone is bigoted. Everyone is terrible. The entire internet here is all trash too. None of us are more righteous or better than anyone else. We are all guilty of being terrible people.

2852,depression,Controversial: How much does this subreddit help?,"Hello all. I am a fairly new member within this subreddit, as I just stumbled upon it about a month or so ago. I have a thought and I was wondering if anybody else has an opinion on this as well. 

Does this subreddit help people break out of a funk or does it just provide more of the same dark feelings and thoughts?

I'm not saying that people are faking it or not being real. I've been in an extremely depressed state where I was thinking about killing myself and making plans in my head. I know how real it is. The darkness I've felt in those times is unlike anything I have ever felt before. It is awful, and the only people who know what it is like are those who have lived through it. In no way am I belittling the feelings and experience for those people. 

I was scrolling through the sub the other day and was reading all of the posts from different members. I read a post that really stung me. And I felt the depression and deep sadness deeper than before I had been on the sub. 

The basic question is this: Does this subreddit perpetuate feelings of depression and hopelessness? Or  is there a lot of great support that happens within the community? 

Would love to hear any thoughts. Again, honest questions from someone who has dealt with and deals with consistent depression."
2853,depression,No point in living,"For some reason, something doesn't want me to have peace here. I can feel it. Something is off about my life, and about this reality. Things don't seem right, or okay. And never really have. I don't think i'll be here much longer. I can't be saved . Or helped. I've tried it all. I'm too ugly to have a good life. I'm too depressed , dumb , and fucked up to have a good life. I may be schziophrenic supposedly, i know deep down in me its there.

I just talked with an online help person and they are so useless. Its all so useless. Life is a prison I think. Thats the only reason why I stay cus I think life is meant to be torture. And if i kill myself i'll get a worse life and get sent back worse off. Maybe if I don't kill myself God will have pity and give me a better life, but i doubt it. I'm not even religious, but i do feel like i'm being screwed with by a higher power.

Why couldnt I have a good life. Why do i need to suffer so god damn much all the fucking time. Why me. Couldn't I just have had something to be truly happy about? A person in my life? nope. Something i was good at? nope. Being good looking? nope. Being smart? nope. Good personality? nope. Less struggling atleast? nope. Fuck. This. World."

Wtf kind of life is this? It's been like this for the last 8 years. Shit man when i wake up i feel like aids always , and the only way to fix it is take a shower so i can feel decent for 1-2 hours before the insecurity/anxiety kicks in.

i keep thinking about suicide but i know i can't do it because i can't hurt my mom like that , and i'm too much of a pussy to actually go through with it. I keep fantasizing about jumping off a large building close to my house but i know that when i'm actually there i won't be able to do it. 

I've also got dark fucking secrets i can't talk to anyone about , just think what are the five worst things some1 could hide &amp; one of those five will be what i'm hiding.

2863,depression,Brain damage from long term depression?,"I have been depressed a long time since the age of 9. I'm 21 now and suffer from extreme brain fog and poor cognition and spacial awareness. It makes even simple tasks difficult and learning to drive is almost impossible even after switching to automatic. I can barely concentrate or interpret things anymore. I feel like I have some kind of learning difficulty now, I used to pick up things easily. Now I am struggling more than ever. Do you think this could be a result of the long term depression?

2865,depression,I don’t know what to do,I wish I didn’t have to talk online. I feel horrible and I just want to physically  talk to someone who actually cares  and maybe even hug them for a few minutes. I feel pointless and find joy in nothing anymore. at just 15 I feel I have nothing left to do in life and don’t want to continue. In 2017 my grandma who I spent my whole life with everyday passed of cancer and I haven’t been anywhere close to remotely happy since. Then about a year ago now my best friend growing up that  passed in a car crash that also liked 3 others and that definitely didn’t help any. I never had many friends to begin with and none were really that close. I am “happy” when I’m around others but I’ve inadvertently distanced myself from everyone so I can’t even fake being happy anymore. I’m down to my last friend who when I talk to I hate more and more because he just doesn’t care And I kind of feel like I’m just used as a gaming bud who helps him get free things from me in games after I stop playing. But I really don’t want to be 100% lonely so I keep talking. I don’t know what to do. I can’t make new friends because I’m the ugly “weird” kid that no one wants to be caught near and I find online friendships pointless because I can’t actually make connections with people. I don’t know what to do with myself anymore.

I have ADHD and chronic depression and it’s hard to read cues and read situations correctly sometimes. 
Especially when you’re naturally annoying and have a constant voice inside your head telling you you aren’t good enough. 
I’ve been able to alter my behaviors to a point, but if I don’t pay attention to what I’m doing or how I’m responding to something or someone, if I truly be myself, people won’t like me. 
I’ve been told all my life to be act differently. 
To be normal. 
To stop fidgeting.

2869,depression,Just needed to vent,"I think the first time I ever actually felt real depression was when my parents split up. I was around 10 years old when that happened. My alcoholic father was in and out of jail and when he wasn’t in there he was getting coked out and drunk. He would get drunk and beat my mom and me and my younger brother could do nothing but stand bye and hide ourselves. So why did I become so depressed whenever she finally left him and took us away with her. I would fake being sick almost everyday just so I could go home from school. I would go to the bathroom and shove my fingers down my throat to throw up whatever I could just to have the excuse. That went on for so long that my mom and I had to go to court because I missed so much school. I feel so guilty looking back. Its a blur but I remember things became ok for awhile my mom found a new boyfriend and soon we moved in with him. But I believe I was like 12 when it came out that he was secretly addicted to meth which explained why some of our stuff would go missing, I assume he would pawn it more for drug money, and he was sent to a rehab center. So I would stay home to watch my brothers while my mom worked I even remember having to skip school to watch them. Not long after my mom found another boyfriend and my god he was the most manipulative piece of shit yet. I guess things were ok through middle school I had a lot of social anxiety all through my childhood I mean I would physically shake when I had to meet someone new so I never really had many friends but I was kind of forced to join football in middle school so I made some friends. But then after 8th grade we moved again and so I had to start over and my social and came back. All through high school I kind of flew under the radar. I kept my grades pretty decent and kept to myself most of the time. I do remember having many depressive episodes throughout those 4 years though. I graduated and moved in with my grandparents to go to college. I did ok the first semester but I got pretty bad my second semester. I started drinking and smoking weed every day and idk if it was to numb the pain or to try and feel something. I actually wanted to die. I felt so alone and yet I felt like I was a burden to everyone around me. I never told anyone about what I went through ever. I learned how to pretend and put this mask on that I was fine. So of course I flunked out of college that second semester and I moved in with my mom who had left that pos she had been with for 8 years and was living with the guy she’s with now who’s actually pretty great. I stayed jobless for about 6 months and I’m sure they knew I was depressed but I would cook and clean and they pushed me to get a job because well I was already 20 around that time. So I got a job at a local store and started to feel better but my coworkers were stirring up some drama and I was getting caught in the middle of it so i quit and found a job at a restaurant/bar/venue where I’ve been at ever since. Honestly this job impacted me in a big way it kind of got me out of my shell and ridded me of my social anxiety. Of course I’m still pretty introverted but anyway I was still depressed off and on but like I said I would use this mask to pretend like I was ok. I had never had a girlfriend. I was just never really interested in dating anyone. I mean I had been asked out before but I would always decline and I honestly don’t understand why. But last year I decided I wanted to start dating. And after 2 rejections I decided to focus on myself for a bit longer...but then she came into my life. I’ll call her Sarah. Sarah hit me like a hurricane. She made me feel a happiness I had never felt before. She made me feel love and accepted in a way that I didn’t know was possible. But like a hurricane as quickly as she came she left. We dated for a little over 3 months but Jesus those 3 months felt like a lifetime and yet it still wasn’t enough. She broke up with me in January. After that I fell into the worst depression I have ever felt. She made me feel do happy that I forgot how to pretend to do it so now everyone around me could see it. Everyone could see this monster that I had been hiding all these years. I had my mom and brothers and coworkers all worried about me and it made me feel like the biggest burden. On to of that I was feeling the loss of love. She was going through her own rough depression and suicidal thoughts which is one of the reasons she broke up with me among me being too needy. But like a fool I begged and pleaded for not days or weeks but months for her to come back. I was so bad that I made a suicide video. Obviously I didn’t go through with it but sometimes I wish I had. I was getting better until today. I found out she was with someone new and I don’t know I just broke down again. I honestly want her to be happy with or  without me but does it make me selfish to still wish it was me that she was holding and saying I love you to. Am I just holding onto what she made me feel or is it because she was literally my first everything? Do I really love her or do I just love what she made me feel? I’m not gonna bother her anymore I mean I know that much she blocked me on everything recently which I assume is because she doesn’t want me to see who shes with and I don’t mind that I really don’t. I mean we never really even talked about anything the last thing she text me was about me not getting involved because I had told her family she had tried to kill herself and to look after her because she didn’t think anyone cared about her. I know shes pissed off at me because of that but I was scared for her she was suicidal and I just wanted her to be alive. She said that she told me that in confidence and now she couldn’t trust me. But it wasn’t even about trust at that point. I don’t know. Anyways that was back in February and the last thing she said to me was that I never should’ve gotten involved and that was like 2 months ago. Shes with someone new and I know I can’t be with anyone right now. I need to find myself and I hope maybe who shes with now can try and help her like I wish I could have. And if not she knows I will always be here for her. Anyways just a rant I cant afford a therapist and I don’t have a best friend to talk to about stuff thats been on my mind so if you read this thanks for listening."

I want to have a job that makes me happy, I want to be successful, I want to make my parents proud, and I want to put in the work to do it.

But somehow, despite all the effort I've put in over the past decade and a half of my life, it just feels like it's all for nothing, like I'm going nowhere and the world just doesn't want me to succeed. I try so, so hard to be outgoing and have people like me but somehow I still don't have anybody asking me how I'm doing, wondering how my day went, checking up on me. It feels like people don't notice me, like my efforts to stand out as the compassionate, interesting person I am are just completely overlooked no matter WHO it is.

And at the end of the day I'm just left feeling sad. Just... My mind is in turmoil coming to the realization that no matter how hard I try to change myself for the better, the universe doesn't want it to happen. Whatever greater power is out there must really fucking hate me for some reason cause besides all logic: I'm still alone, and sad, and all around disappointed in the life I have for myself.

I know this is entitled as all hell. Some lame ass 16 year old complaining about some dumbass game while people got real problems, I know. Sorry. Just wish I wasn't such a fucking idiot."
2879,depression,"A ""joke""","I tell a ""joke"" to people who ask me how I am. I say I'm going to look for bigfoot. In reality what I mean is I want to venture far into the wilderness, no food or water, and just walk until my body gives out, or I'm eaten by some forest predator. I fantasize about my skeleton sitting by a tree, just covered in moss. If I am to leave this world that way, at least I'll be of some use to something. I understand the pain this would bring to my loved ones, so realistically I could never do it, but dammit if this isnt just the most comforting thought, and that scares me most of all."
2880,depression,i’m so exhausted,"i decided to take summer class to catch up w my degree and having something to do, but it was a terrible idea. i can’t complete a single assignment on time and despite all the hours that i sleep, i’m still so so so exhausted. i’m easily overwhelmed and even a 3-minute conversation feels like i just presented an entire ted talk or something .. i can’t even listen to music or watch anything like i just lay in bed and stare at the corner until i’m forced to come back to reality, unfortunately. i haven’t brushed my teeth or showered in weeks. everything is a burden. i wish i could going to a coma for a few weeks or just disappear. i don’t want to think or know anything like i just want to feel peace."
2881,depression,Life isnt for everyone,"I've spent all of my adult life thinking that everyone hated being alive. I have now realized that it's not that common. I've been struggling with being alive for as long as I can remember, which leads me to believe that maybe life was simply not a good match for me. 
Feel free to change my mind."
2882,depression,Why does everything I am excited about get ruined,"Whenever I am happy and motivated to do something, whatever I was planning on doing gets completely ruined and it feels like the one thing that was keeping me going has disappeared. Then I suddenly get super frustrated and have to numb myself out so that I don’t hurt myself. And suddenly get desperate for someone to respond to my texts etc and I freak out when no one does. I give up. Nothing is worth it if everything that might give me any hope of ever being happy is ruined. I don’t even know if this makes sense but I feel like an idiot for ever having hope."
2883,depression,How I healed myself from depression and from being an asshole.,"I used to be depressed , , , , and irritable.  This began to change when I started a ketogenic diet.  Then I included fasting in my health regimen.  Then I moved on to a carnivorous diet and things got even better.  I started regular hot/cold showers and got another uptick in my happiness level.  Everything that I did reduced inflammation, and the depression and irritability got better.  I started grounding/earthing, and wow.  It really was all about reducing inflammation.  I am now doing sunbathing/trans-medical levels of vitamin D, and I feel like I have arrived and must tell other people.

&amp;#x200B;

Talk therapy was a complete bust for me, a waste of a lot of money.  Lots of pills, other than vitamin D, was also a waste of money.  It was all about inflammation and living in accordance with our evolutionary past.  The closer I live to paleo/natural, the lower my inflammation, and less depression and irritability I have.  It is as simple as that."
2884,depression,I just want someone to come brutally murder me,"I fucking hate myself so much I dont give a fuck anymore, I dont care what people think I just wanna die so much like please god just end it right now why did you make me like this, everyone else is having the time of there life traveling, getting married, having kids, then I've been single for my 22 years of living. Im ugly, too depressed to care anymore, working out doesn't do shitballs fuck it all. Maybe ill just kill myself tomorrow and post it on the internet. I have no friends I'm a loser, I forgot what it feels like to be happy. I wish I was a miscarriage ffs mom why'd you have to give birth to me. Dumb stupid tiny dicked piece of shit I am. FUUUUUCCCKKKK!!!!!! This is what you wanna see right kids who bullied me in the past? They abused me and grew up, went to school got nice jobs and I was halted on life because of it. You guys fucked up my self esteem no matter how good I eat, how much I work out, how many people i meet, I just will always hate myself now cause thats what you fuckers made me feel like... Just somebody who was born to be hated and what on. Jesus Christ someone help me I dont know what to do. Im gonna end up killing myself I swear."
2885,depression,Anyone wanna be my friend,I just want to have one genuine friend who actually cares about me. I know I'm a handful messaging everyday and calling but that's just cause I'm afraid to lose that person. I know that once I stop doing that they'll forget about me like I never existed and that's what I'm afraid of.
2886,depression,Bddhxbdjssbddn,I’m so fucking close to snapping oh my god I just want to fucking strangle everyone I see i either kill myself or go crazy at this point I fucking hate everything fuck off
2887,depression,Resentful toward parents,Does anyone else ever feel resentful toward their parents? Sometimes I feel angry toward them and don't want to visit them because I deal with so many mental health issues that they've contributed a lot to. I really struggle. I know I need to take responsibility for myself and get better on my own. I know that blaming them is useless. I know I should forgive. But I can't help but feel this way from time to time.
2888,depression,Life is stress,"That’s all there is anymore. Stress about me, stress about family, stress about school, stress about jobs, stress about money, stress about being good enough, stress about self-hatred, heck, I’m even stressing about stressing! I’m at my breaking point. Anyone else stress about everything?"
2889,depression,Before I commit suicide I want to help people who are suffering like me,[removed]
2890,depression,We all have our secrets,"I was watching the trailer for No Time to Die and the line ""We all have our secrets. We just didn't get to yours yet"" really got to me. I feel like the secrets I harbor just consume me everyday. The secrets that meant to cast a safety net for myself and to protect others' feelings, simply became the inner demons that torture me everyday. But the fear of the consequence of withdrawing that safety net, the fear of losing everything and everyone I know, seems worse and more terrifying. I've backed myself into a corner with no exit. I really wish there is a way to travel back in time, and simply be honest with myself without these secrets that are weighing on and crushing me."
2891,depression,People only like the idea of a broken soul,"No one likes a broken soul . Idk if its just me , but I feel like the glamorised , almost trivial sort of sadness is the only one which is “ supported “ , once things get too messy or real , everyone runs for the hills , or suddenly it sounds like you’re self pitying and dramatic , or self diagnosing in a twisted search for attention ( or confusion )  . I don’t blame anyone though , at the end of the day no one really wants something that’s broken , it’s way too complicated."
2892,depression,Depression is reality with glasses on,"I can't help but think that depression is showing me what reality really is, and that perception of reality just makes me prefer to disappear from this world rather than curing myself of this stupid fucking disease. Why would I want to convince myself further that this stupid life of mine isnt shit when it actually is??? It's like a reality check it's like I'm wearing glasses which gives me a whole better view of this dumb fucking world"
2893,depression,Nobody cares what my opinion is.,"I'm 36, married, Father of 4, 10+ years of experience in my field. It doesn't matter what I say, or how I say it, nobody cares what my opinion is. My wife, my kids, my parents, or my co workers. I would say friends, but heh, you have to have some of those. So I guess it's just time to stop bothering to share my opinion, since it has 0 value to people."
2894,depression,"Need to vent, can't wait for next appointment","Warning a bit lengthy
Soon to be Air Force veteran, officially getting out of the military in a few days. I out-processed and moved a month ago. I'm getting a disability check, I’ve got my healthcare covered, and a place to live. I guess I should be happy, but I feel just as depressed and angry as ever, maybe even worse. 

I never deployed, my job wasn't by any means major or important. My work was always substandard, no matter how many times I told myself I would do better. When I did get handed something I thought was interesting, I managed to fuck it up. And if I didn’t somehow, people would usually just ignore it anyway. Was going to kill myself a few years ago but got talked out of it by a friend who pulled me aside two days before my decided date. 

Lots of people tried to help, though I doubt most of them gave a shit. People start to push you away once you start telling them heavy shit. Even the ones I thought were close friends told me “I wish you wouldn’t be so sad all the time.” Everyone has their own problems, I get it.

Regardless, I don’t tell any of my “friends” anything emotional now, even if they tell me stuff. Got issues trusting, a hard time just taking care of my own basic needs, and in general just feel like my whole life has been a joke. I failed at serving my country and I don’t feel like I deserve the benefits I’m going to get. I’m trying to do better but especially this past week I’ve just felt miserable and lonely. Nothing is bringing me joy. They always said that suicide was a temporary solution but honestly if my whole life is just gonna be this I don’t want to keep wasting taxpayer money on someone as worthless as me."
2895,depression,Seems pointless,"Go to work, come home, eat, shower, stay awake with insomnia till bout two hours before needing to be back at work sleep and repeat. Every day for the next 45 years. 

Weekends come along and I just sleep or go to work. 

Nothing is fun, too stupid to get a better job, make too little money to go out and do something fun. Zero friends because depression drove them away plus they are all smart and attractive so got married and too busy. 
Be constantly worried about going to the hospital or not being able to afford medication because dont get insurance with the job or make enough to pay for medical insurance, car insurance, rent, and food. 

I dont see the point in living anymore if this is all life has to offer. 
Be worried, be anxious, be depressed. Repeat."
2896,depression,Idk how to title this,I’m not good at expressing my feelings and my life but here it is if you don’t want to read everything it’s okay. I grew up being a loner since no one at school loved me and wanted to talk to me. I don’t know what it is to have a best friend I don’t know what it is to have someone who genuinely care about you and who is gonna stay for years and that you can share everything. I was the mom of my mom always helping her. My first attempt was at 10 because of all the bullying and what was happening where I was. I grew up taking my mom as a model and realized how delusional I was. I heard my stepdad screaming he’s gonna hit my mom and kill her. I saw him punch her I saw him abuse her mentally physically financially I saw my own mom wound on her wrist bleeding and her screaming saying the world would be better without her. My stepbrother tried to touch me twice. I’ve been raped multiple times by different men and never admit it before. My stepdad who cheats constantly on my mom and gave her a disease that she can die is asking to his own stepdaughter if he can help her camming which is crazy. I’m so god damn tired of people telling me it’s gonna be okay with time but it’s never have been I don’t know how to act I don’t know how to dress I don’t know when and how to do it right I’ve been depressed since so long I don’t know even know what it is not to be depressed. I’m not looking for advice because I’ve heard all of them I just want a person being there physically for me who can listen and care the same way I would do to them.
2897,depression,Has anyone else suppressed their emotions to the point where you feel disconnected from everything?,"I feel like a robot pretending to be human. One of my coping mechanisms is suppressing emotions which worked great until I guess I went too far. Now I’m numb and detached. I can barely feel anything. I feel negative emotions, such as anger/irritation, but that’s it. When I’m with a group of people and someone is telling what’s supposed to be a funny story, I have to remind myself to laugh. Someone is talking to me, I have to physically force myself to smile. I don’t really know how to explain it, but I just feel completely disconnected from human experiences."
2898,depression,I keep relapsing...,"I went 2 months clean of self-harm. Last night, I accidentally broke a glass. I used that glass and cut my arms. This happened because I am under so much pressure from school, (College) and my dog just died. I don’t want my family to find out...... life just seems like and endless void, none of us chose to be born, and we keep forcing more humans into existence. Why are we doing this? Why isn’t there and easy way out!!"

2900,depression,The worst sound I've ever heard,"I don't know if this belongs here as it's not to do with depression but I don't know any other emotional support subreddits and I think I'm in shock or something. Today as I was about to leave for work my girlfriend texted me that there were cops in here driveway. Her parents were in the middle of a divorce and her dad went to a park that was sentimental to him and overdosed on leftover oxy for his wife's back pain. I called out of work and went to go comfort her. The thing I remember most clearly is her repeating ""why didn't he say bye to me"" over and over. I couldn't cry while I was there I wanted to keep it together for her. Now I'm just in pain. I was just starting to get more close to her father and now he's dead. I don't even know what's real anymore"
2901,depression,I always feel so close to being content for once in my life,"Then something happens, and I get sad again, making all of that progress go to waste. Then, back to square one I go. This never ending chase for happiness."
2902,depression,I'm so fucking tired of being voiceless.,"I'm sick of it. I grew up alone, and everything I said to the few people I knew was always brushed aside. In every single occasion, whatever I had to get off my chest was met with mockery. I'm tired of having my feelings brushed aside because ""I'm just a teenager"" or ""it's just a phase"". I'm fucking tired. I'm a human being and I deserve to be heard. I don't think I can stand yelling at the void for much longer."
2903,depression,I really hate myself,"and wish that I could have been anybody else. 

I'll repeat this forever, even after I die and face whoever is standing on the other side. I'm not thankful for life."
2904,depression,Depressive episode at my friends bachelor party,"I am so so sad. I’ve been telling myself all day that they don’t care about you. I just want to be at home in my bed rn, but I know I need to try being social. This is the first time hanging out in like 4 or 5 months and I have no people skills anymore. I don’t really drink as much as they do (prefer to smoke) and feel like I’m being such a downer to everyone. I have felt like a burden this whole weekend. I should be having so much fun but I just can’t. This is so exhausting. I really really wish I was normal :/"

I want to hear your experience with anti depressive medicine."
2906,depression,I can't stop crying today,"Earlier today I was shown a video of a young boy being murdered by police in Austin, TX. His head was completely split open and blood pouring out. The camera man was running to the young boy screaming ""medic!"" Like he was in a war zone, not some local park... When I found out he was 16 and just walking home from work I started crying and been so down since. Thinking about what his family must be going through and how hard that was to witness for bystanders and the medic and I just pray that young man didn't suffer long.

I have been to the marches in my hometown protesting and trying to show my support in numbers. There are sooo many young people there, teenagers. While it makes me proud they are working hard to make change in this country it scares me we might lose another young soul to police brutality. That a March isn't worth losing their entire lives over and it scary to see how little we have control over it...the young boy was just walking home from work. My little sister is 16 and I just keep thinking about what if that was her on the ground bleeding...I hope she is staying safe, I hope everyone is trying to stay safe I know it's hard right now.

I think myself and millions of others can say we are not proud to be american, this country is soul crushing. I can't get out of bed."
2907,depression,virtual study/work room for fellow depressed people?,"tl/dr - anyone up for virtual study room for depressed people since its getting harder and harder to study, and its not the same doing this with people who dont get the challenges of being depressed

background: the biggest thing thats part of my depression, other than feeling terrible, is my inability to study. Now, zoloft has covered me for the feeling terrible part. however the inability to study remains and has worsened during pandemic, as i'm sure many of you can relate to, from reading other peoples comments and posts 

Ive seen other people in this subred suggesting people study together which i think would be a good idea. at my uni, the library  team have set up virtual study ""retreats"" which seemed like a good idea, especially with its rigid structure but weird because it was hard having to relate to people who weren't depressed/otherwise neurologically challenged, who aren't plagued with chronic procrastination and guilt and all those other bad feelings

how it would work: a zoom meeting, or similar, where we'd be together studying. . we'd have sessions of 15 minutes (lets not be too ambitious - we lack executive function), before which we'd maybe be in breakout groups and discuss what we want to do in the next 15 mins. no judgement, so all tasks from checking and replying to important emails, to writing something for a dissertation, or making a timetable, glancing at ur syllabus etc.  Maybe discussing your mental blocks and fears  out loud in a non judgmental and equal space will help make it easier, as it has done for me in the past 

i know stuff like this exists already, such as on r/study, but for me the important thing was to find other people who can empathise with me, as someone who is depressed. hearing about how other people are finding studying to be an impossible task is quite helpful to me, and makes me feel like less of a failure!

Let me know if youd be up for this, and i'll sort out the logistics. also i've been meaning to make this post for over 2 weeks, and have been putting of studying until i had done so lol

if this already exists please link me - again the point for me is to find other people in my situation who are finding it difficult to study, I don't want to be intimidated by people who are very productive and study for hours and hours

much love x"
2908,depression,Feel like I can't trust women anymore after seeing sex workers,Every girl just uses guys for money and resources. They act all sweet and steal your heart. But then they empty your wallet and throw you away like nothing. You think these sex workers are drug addicted low lifes but the reality is that cute girl in your class you have a crush on has done the same. Women play with men's emotions for their own personal gain. It's rampant. How can I ever trust women again???

I have cried, i have screamed from the top of my lungs, but there is no remedy. I am angry, at God, at myself, I am full of regret, anguish, sadness and sorrow. I cant keep going. As much as i try to be strong and try to keep pushing, the memories always hit me late at night. I cant sleep, I dont eat healthy, i stop doing everything i loved doing. Sometimes i sit and stare blankly at nothing with an emotionless face for hours. Suicide has crossed my mind countless times but  I will never go through with it, i still have people care too much about.  But nothing can take this black hole in my chest, I mean Nothing, no love nothing, i dont want to love anyomore, everything i love dies.

My life has been falling apart 
My grades have gone to shit , I feel really demotivated to do anything , I don’t find joy in the things I love , my parents don’t believe in me anymore &amp; say I’ll end up no where in life. They constantly try bringing me down with their talks about other people &amp; just demotivate me ( even if it’s not their intention ) 
I’m in a happy relationship with a girl ive been for almost a year &amp; a half now , even she is dealing with so much abusive stuff in her fam 
she’s the one who has to take care of everyone &amp; sometimes gets really burned out &amp; depressed
I always do my best to cheer her up , give her the world &amp; make her feel special but constantly doing so drains me aswell 
don’t get me wrong 
I love her more than anything &amp; would love to spend the rest of my life with her 
the stuff she’s dealing with is really toxic &amp; she has an abusive father aswell 
This year I almost gave up on everything 
I started isolating myself from everyone 
I was a pretty healthy &amp; physically fit guy until that went down the drain aswell 
I’m just so burned out from everything 
to fam problems , relationship stuff , personal stuff 
it’s too much 
I always want to be the guy who comes out stronger after going through any hardship but at this point 
I don’t know what to do

28f(me) How I can help myself to start a relationship after I’ve been single for 4 years ( struggling with career + mental health issue)
I’ve been living in the states for 8 years, and I couldn’t get a job offer in the past year. One of the reason that I heard from feed bacl; ppl said that I’m not confident.
( but one interview this manager said to me I have the skills; but I didn’t get an offer. )
 I have commitment issue( &amp; depression, biopolar) I’ve been fighting these issues since I can remember. 

[ 1 how to spot red flags before or during a relationship? 2 how to accept potential new relationship 

I am afraid to commit. My ex cared about me but he was manipulative. We were in 4 yr relationship. I’m 6 yrs younger than him, both introverts. I want to know how to find the right person who wants harmonious sexual lifestyle as my bf / future husband. How to spot red flags before marry someone that might cause dead bedroom??

I’m single (who should be married with kids as in my culture) who only had 1 longterm relationship. Ex refused to be passionate and Acted gross out when I asked him to give me oral; Did help me orgasm( play w my clit and other things). I was younger I felt that he doesn’t care about my requests, also he didn’t wanted to get back in shape to offer better sex.

I’d like to have another relationship asap; now that I’ve been single for 4 years. I had sex with some singles it was passionate some were really good, i enjoy climax a little before sex. Some guys have amazing personalities.

I had a convo w/ a friend I couldn’t tell her that I have commitment issue. She know that Id be better off to have a bf. I couldn’t even let the guys I dated to know that I prefer to have sex w someone whose in a relationship w/ me. There were guys asked to be in a relationship w/ me without me bringing it up(sweet), but I was not ready (didn’t find the one) The last guy( 2 -3 yrs younger than me) I dated we slept together a few times, I told him that I’d like to be w/ him (guess that I’m not his gf type, obviously I can’t get enough of him; I was catching feelings) but he didn’t want me. ( of course it is usually the guy asks the girl, this is probably going to be my first time and the last time to ask that question to a guy)

I haven’t had sex since 2020 started. This time im hoping to have that special relationship first... Celibate a little bit more is not going to hurt my feelings or anyone elses... How can I be more open minded and accept better ppl( potential bf), start to date my future bf/husband?

Thanks I hope ppl can understand the writing and I’m all ears. ]
  
TL;DR how can I regain comfort with having a relationship( goal is to eventually get married) ? 
What are the signs of awesome husband traits( don’t have a father figure growing up)?"
2917,depression,Why do I always feel disconnected...?,.
2918,depression,Please help. Did anyone switch from amitriptyline?,"Did you switch from it to a different antidepressant? Specifically an SSRI (not another tricyclic)? What was your original dose?

What did you switch to? And to what dose? How long did it take you to switch? Any side effects?

How do you feel now?"
2919,depression,When does it get better?,"When I was about 15, I asked on here a similar question. Some people said it never does. But some said life is so kuch better once you are out of school. Ive been out of school for a little over a year now. I've done many things that most depressed people wouldn't do. But I still feel the same. I have a desire to one day kill myself. Life is boring and disappointing most the time. The good moments don't feel very worth it. There are no more significant milestones in my life with school being over and no ambitions. So is this just how i will feel until I die?"
2920,depression,First post,I'm 16 years old and the only child left on the family farm. Recently I have been become continually more stressed and depressed. My parents have a genuine problem with work load. I have even talked to them about how I feel and yet they don't give me any slack and starting to make me feel a million times worse. I love my parents but when I argue with them or am just too depressed to work they just get very angry with me and t ends up making me more angry and depressed.
2921,depression,Why are people romanticize depression and think of it has a personality trait,"I just don’t get why people would want to think of depression as an esthetic. Wouldn’t this just make you think depression makes you “edgy and different” and make you lie to yourself “everything’s okay this is just who I am?”

I just don’t understand why people would want to romanticize being lonely and hating yourself all the time and just wanting to disappear."
2922,depression,Bottled up my whole life,"My entire life, I have never spoken to anyone about my feelings or mental health. Being vulnerable was, and still is, such a foreign concept to me that I feel sick even trying to mention just a fraction of how I feel to somebody. I’ve always put on a facade of seeming normal and okay, but I can’t do it anymore. The fact that I’m seeking help on Reddit makes me feel like even more of a jackass, but maybe I can get some advice from some like-minded individuals. I know that listening to other people’s problems can be hard, especially when a lot of us have our own issues to deal with, but if you have a second, it’s always appreciated.

Over the past 2 or so years, I have felt myself deteriorating mentally more and more each day. Like my will to live drains with each passing hour. I can easily say that the last time I felt happy or excited was over 8 years ago, and the last time I cried was over 5 years ago. Video games, Nature, history, music, passions of mine since I was in kindergarten, no longer mean anything to me anymore. All I feel is numbness. I have no reaction or care for anything, and I can go from feeling completely neutral to suicidal within minutes. I feel like such a failure to my mother, the greatest and kindness person I have ever known. Even when she brings me gifts like food, clothes, games, all I can muster is a weak, disingenuous smile. I can see the disappointment in her face. She wants a son that’s happy and reacts to things. She wants a son that smiles for photos. She wants a son that will have conversations with her, not the lifeless husk that is me. 

My father, arguably the most manipulative and disgusting person I have come to know, does not help the situation at all. Since as far back as I can remember, it’s been criticism, vicious beatings, threats, and torture. I remember losing teeth when I was younger after being hit in the face by him over a game of toy soldiers. Not only this, but he would viciously beat my brother in front of me for minor things (such as grades, saying the wrong thing, etc). Chairs, brooms, pots, pans, fists, boots, it didn’t matter to him what he beat us with. One day, after my brother misbehaved in school, my father threatened to put rat poison in our food without us knowing. Sometimes he would lock my brother and I in a pitch-black room without dinner simply because he didn’t feel like dealing with us until my mother would come home. Even to this day, I am still spoken to as if I’m a child, CONSTANT CRITICISM about everything, putting/taking food on my plate as if I’m 5, threatening to storm into my job and get me fired, shit-talking my mother and her family, calling me lazy despite the fact I work 45+ hours a week, bipolar mood swings over the smallest issues, guilt-tripping, the list goes on. 

Since I am usually always at work during the day, this leaves me with plenty of time to think. I think about how tired I am all the time, how I spend all of my willpower just dragging myself out of bed in the morning, how much better off things would be if I just blasted my head open with a shotgun. How fucking numb I feel to EVERYTHING. How I can’t hold a conversation with anyone, even lifelong friends, because even talking just drains me mentally. I don’t have the drive to move on  anymore and frankly I don’t want to. I have no plans for the future because I simply do not care, and hopefully one day I can muster up the courage to end it all. 

Probably gonna end up deleting this later, because like I said, being vulnerable like this makes me feel weak and sick."
2923,depression,I feel like I was left behind and I don’t know how to catch back up and that this actually could be my life now.,
2924,depression,I just need some strength to get up and clean my apartment.,"I have no energy to do it even though all i do is sleep for 12-16 hours a day and eat. I need to get out of this rut. Idk how to even begin. Idk who to talk to. My friends aren't very helpful. Every time i tell the something it turns into this weird contest of who is more depressed, i hate it. I'm tired man idk."
2925,depression,Violent.,"I have a boxing dummy at home and releasing rage on it just isn’t enough, I want to hear someone beg for me to stop and show mercy but I wanna see their tears and blood flow to show them the pain they’ve caused to me. They put a stigma on me and I’ve changed but nobody notices. They bullied me, and ruined my reputation now I got no friends except 1 that I truly trust. Is there something wrong with me.

2926,depression,I wish I could go back time and give 7 years old me a hug,"I'm currently having vivid flashbacks of traumatic events that happened years ago and have no way to stop them.
I remembered my mother telling me to ""stop talking about suicide all the time because it's annoying"" and ignoring me despite walking on my self harm attempts. My dad used to beat the shit out of me all the time and I'm still scared of him to this day. She never did anything and actually uses those events to shut me up.

My only wish was to have a happy loving family and it never happened. I'm trying to make the most out of it, to forgive and be patient, to talk things out, to scream, insult back and defend myself but it doesn't work, nothing ever worked 

I don't know what to do anymore"
2927,depression,I feel tired,"Hi guys, 

For a few weeks now I've been feeling tired and ready to go, only just graduated high school and I think I've had my fill of life. Feel like heading over to the overpass and just do it, ya know one and done. Really doesn't help that I've been drinking every day for the past 2 weeks roughly, even while typing this out. Can't really remember when it got bad. Lotta things didn't work out the way they did, little things that started to snowball so Im just stuck. I just need some advice on how to deal with this kinda feeling. Much appreciated and have a good one."
2928,depression,Buying food for no reason,"Since I’ve moved into my own place, I’ve bought a lot of fast food. I get it while I’m on my way home and most of the time I’m not hungry at all. I think maybe it’s just for comfort because I feel more depressed and it helps me not think about it. Depression sucks and eating food that’ll only make me gain weight and make me feel even more shitty about myself is not going to make things better. I’ve even cooked at home so that way I don’t have the urge to eat out but I still do. 

Moving by myself was supposed to help me work on myself. Become an independent women and all I’ve done is sit on my ass and eat McDonald’s. Why is it so damn hard to just do something good for myself. This isn’t the life I want."

2931,depression,am i crazy?,"i just really need to talk to someone. the thought of suicide sounds so appealing for the shock factor. probably neglect as a child makes me feel the NEED for people to pay attention to me. i want the news to be broadcasted on social media about my death and i want people to feel bad for me. ive been a selfless person my whole life, i don't know why i'm like this now. maybe i'm just a shitty person."
2932,depression,I expect way too much of myself,"I put myself up to near impossible standards, and I expect nothing less than perfection of myself. If I’m not the best, or if I don’t meet my own expectations at a task, than I’m no better than someone who’s never done it before. I like to draw, and I want to work for Cartoon Network or something and make good cartoons, but I’m scared. I haven’t had time to draw in a while, and since drawing is a perishable skill, I’ve near forgotten how to do it. I need practice. But every time I put my pencil to paper, my mental picture just doesn’t translate well. Everything I make is disgusting and shouldn’t be called art. I can’t even get anything down without erasing it by this stupid, idiotic logic. I’m scared that if I don’t get my act together before I graduate, I’ll have to pursue a different career. I have no idea what to do. Sorry for the long read, I’d like some suggestions or something, but i think I just needed to get this out."
2933,depression,I just want someone to ask,"I just want someone to ask how I’m doing
I’ve been feeling this way for the past couple months and I really don’t know what to do about it
I just stumbled upon this subreddit while drunk and don’t know if it really fits here but I have to get this off my chest and I’m way too much of a pussy to tell this to anyone I know so here goes nothing

I don’t know if it’s even depression but I’m an edgy teen so I guess I’ll go with it 
It’s undiagnosed so I’m probably just sad and should go with it.
I don’t really want to die but I tell myself I do so I can have an excuse.
It’s really just an excuse to be lazy and not fucking deal with it.
I’m in my fucking bathroom at 1 o clock wishing I wasn’t there but here I am. I wish someone would ask me how am I’m cause I dont feel ok"
2934,depression,I hate myself. Why wont my mind stop?,"It seems like small posts to random people who dont know me is better then actually talking to people who say they care. Even if I get few responses it feels like the few people who do understand better then the people in my life. When I open up to people in my life they leave me. It's always my fault. What's wrong with me? Will I ever be someone who can keep someone in their life? Or will I always have to bottle these emotions to a point that I break? I'm honestly glad nobody I know reads this...

I dont want to tell them they arent good enough becasue that will only push them furthur away from me. Though they dont help me. They know how to I explicitly tell them what helps what would make me happy or in a better mood but they do what they want to do...I cant blame them for my mistakes though. I have no one to blame except myself...

I've recently lost 2 people who are important to me. They were the only people I talked to more than once a month. I dont feel like I have anybody I can go to when I feel broken who will hold me and tell me it's going to be okay. I'm alone. Now anyway. It's always my fault. I hate myself constantly and I feel like I need to punish myself for pushing them away or for them wanting to leave me. 

I am nothing. I am nobody. I am empty.

Why cant I be someone who people want to keep in their life? Haha I want to bash my head on a wall or scratch my arm again to the point of scars. I want to cut I want to drown myself, choke myself, just HARM myself. I dont deserve happiness I deserve pain for how I treat people and how nobody wants to stay with me. 

I hate myself so much why wont my mind shut up. Please just be quiet. Why cant it empty? Why arent I good enough? Why cant I die without hurting people? Why cant I have just never have been born? Why am I me?"

2936,depression,Story tell me what you think," I wrote this a few years ago I sometimes write when I don't know how to express or just don't know why I feel a certain way and I just can't bring myself to read what I wrote again although I do remember the gist of it but i felt like putting it out into the world. So here goes nothing: Girl in the Mirror 
When I walk by I see a figure staring at me that looks very familiar Someone I maybe used to know I walk towards them and they begin to insult me and tell me how worless and useless I am. I look around wondering if anyone else can see this person but there is no one there and the insults keep coming . You are a stupid motherfucker who will never achieve anything in this world, anything and everything you do will never be worth it no matter how hard you try, your life is pointless why are you still even here, the people you know don't even care what the fuck happens to you. If you disappear it'll be just like you were never hear and everyone will move on as always with no worries in their mind while you are standing here starring at a mirror and listening to the voice inside your head that no one else can hear tearing yourself apart not even being able to recognize yourself in the mirror you think its an entirely different human being. Look at the person in the mirror and tell them to fuck of because you know you're better than them. Don't let me win, let you win. The person that is standing there is worth so much more than you know. My job is to belittle and break you but it's up to you to decide if you'll listen or walk away and find the person you truly want to be."
2937,depression,I ran into this scene on youtube,[removed]
2938,depression,Getting left for girlfriend/vent,"A couple hours ago I was having a great time with one of my few friends. I've never been a ""gamer"" but due to corona my friends got me into it and into discord. So anyway we were playing Total War Shogun 2 for a couple hours, then he said he had to run a quick errand. We talked while he was going, he lives 2 minutes from a gas station but he wouldn't tell me what he was getting. He got back and we played for a little bit longer but I could tell he was distracted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then he told me his girlfriend got to his house. I'm friends with her so it wasn't a big deal but I knew we weren't going to talk for much longer. When he said his gf got there I got so sad. We talked for a bit and had one last battle. They tried to make me feel like I wasn't getting in the way of anything and tried talking to me longer than they should have. Then he said he should get going. I agreed, I don't dispute or ridicule when my friends ditch me to be with their gfs. I would do the same if I had one. 

&amp;#x200B;

I left the discord call and just sat there, depression starting to swell. I wasn't expecting to feel this tonight, I thought we would've played till 2 like usual and I go right to bed so I can avoid the loneliness. I realized why he had to abruptly run an errand, he was getting condoms. I started to imagine what it would be like to have a gf. To have a girl in your room. I don't think I even know the half of it. All the small details of feeling wanted or loved I'll never know. I don't feel anger towards him or anything. I don't know what I feel except so sad I can't begin to place why. I should be grateful that he spent time with me in the first place. I will just never be truly happy. I have this dangerous mindset that if I ever got a gf my depression would finally be cured. But I know it's not that easy or magical. I'll probably be doomed to this for my life. Never having a gf isn't nearly the only cause of my depression don't worry. 

&amp;#x200B;

I sit here now trying to occupy the time by writing this out. I am so depressed. I've been depressed for years. I could have a great day with my friends but when I get home alone I forget about it. It seems I get depressed at the drop of a hat. I hate it. I can't pull myself out of it. No matter how good a day I have the depression comes for me regardless. I don't have any self esteem. I hate myself, I'll be alone the rest of my life. No hope. I hate this feeling it's so deep in me. I'm not doing this for much longer. But I guess I do have some small hope that's why I'm trying to give myself some more time. I just can't handle all this pain. I don't want to feel like this anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a mess, stupid, and kinda pointless I'm sorry. I just wrote this to occupy myself."
2939,depression,Exhausted and Hopeless,"I don't know where to begin but I don't think I've ever felt so defeated, hopeless, and confused with my own life. Being the son of immigrant parents and 1st gen college student, I feel a tremendous amount of responsibility to live up to their expectations and dreams. I survived my first semester of college with decent grades but it drained the life out of me and I don't want to do this for the next four years let alone two years. In addition, all my anxious thoughts, insecurities, and mistakes keep haunting me especially during quarantine and everything going on in the news isn't helping. I don't mean to sound selfish and I know people are going through worse things, I just needed to voice myself in hopes of being understood."

My first ever real relationship at 22. I feel so used. Idk why I let him take my virginity. I feel disgusted. I think he gave me an std. planning on going to the doctor here soon. I want to die. I could never trust guys because of my dad. But I trusted him. I felt safe. Now I feel lied to. I feel gross. Why did I let this guy into my life? I want to die. :’(

2945,depression,Remembering the past hurts.,"I often find myself discarding and erasing any traces of my past, and then spending the rest of the day feeling terrible about it. I've had bad experiences in the past like anyone else, but it's the good experiences that I constantly find myself trying to forget. 
  
  
I just really hate remembering the good moments because I hate remembering that I used to be happy. Before adulthood and all of its complexities, there were moments when I was carefree, and little things (like eating a favorite food or watching a TV show that I used to like) were more than enough to make my day. There were times when all I needed to be happy was a good book or a full night's sleep instead of a cocktail of various pills and energy drinks. 
  
  
There was a time when I was still myself, and not the fragile, broken person that I've become. Now, any traces of the old me are painful, and completely ruin my day. The old me has been dead for ages, and even remembering her is torturous. I would rather forget that she ever existed, and get by with ""good enoughs"", like when the pills are actually enough to get me through the day, or when I still have enough energy to clean my room or have a home-cooked meal. I hope that doesnt sound too dramatic. That's genuinely how I live, and I'm just trying to make the most of it."

2947,depression,Sad,I used to be extremely depressed but then I met my wonderful girlfriend R. I’ve been dating her for 5 months and everything has been going great but tonight she left to go to a party with some friends and it’s actually making my heart hurt. I told her that my heart is hurting because she is sneaking out but she went and did it anyways. She is saying she needs to feed her wild side and that she won’t do anything stupid like cheat on me or anything like that. I’ve been cheated one in the other 5 relationships I’ve had so I feel like it’s just going to happen again. She says she loves me but I’m starting to doubt it now that she isn’t caring that her sneaking out of her parents house is hurting me. I can tell I’m starting to get depressed again. If there is anyone out there that could help me with this I would appreciate it.
2948,depression,I just hate life in general,"I just don't like nor care for life or this world. Reality is just so boring. I can't find a single interesting thing in this world, everything is just plain and mediocre at best. I have nothing that i want, no ambitions or dreams or desires, everything is just feels so unexciting. I feel like there's nothing in this world worthy putting effort into since the outcome is always so unsatisfying. 

I can't comprehend how other humans are fine living like this. How is anyone content with having countless boring responsibilities everyday and worrying about pointless things while believing that some short term dopamine hits are worth this constant suffering."

2953,depression,Looking for answers,"I came on Reddit to find answers and just search deeper into my own emotions and feelings. I've had different situations occur to me throughout my life and no one would think I have, I walk around with a fake smile. constantly attacking myself over the slightest things. Currently, I'm struggling with the idea of having a direction or focus. everything around me seems so give or take. I push in a good direction, I get pulled back. everything lately has seemed so neutral and I feel as if I'm struggling to keep myself in place. Every day is the same routine due to different aspects that have affected my life over time, with not many ways to fix it. I know it's okay to not be okay. if someones ask what's wrong I don't have an answer, I'm just lost. I'm not looking for specific answers, I'm looking for things others have looked to, for a direction or just some uplifting each day. Some routine breakers and just some personal opinions.

I’m crying while I type this and I just don’t know how to deal with things. Life is so fucking hard man. And I can’t bear to leave him alone. But it gets to a certain point sometimes.

2957,depression,Help,"depression runs in my family, and I had a terrible year last year dealing with suicidal thoughts and things like that but I’ve gotten completely over it, went to therapy even though it didn’t help. I learned to push things away, thoughts that make me question life. But now it’s really hard to be sad. I can feel all my other normal emotions, but I spent so much time practicing not crying and not being sad that I can hardly be sad even when I want to. Like right now I feel like I need to cry but I can’t. Whenever something happens in my life that could be bad I just push it away and distract myself, and it’s been working. But I know it’s healthy to be sad. I have also lost interest in drawing and animation, which I used to invest almost all my time in. I’m still interested in other things though. I’m scared that I’m starting to get depression, but I really don’t want to take medicine, I have been diagnosed with adhd, and have tried many medications for it, they all turned out badly. I also probably have anxiety but like I said, I learned to push things away so that they don’t bother me. What should I do?"
2958,depression,why do I feel fine rn? but later I'll be really sad again.,How can I feel completely fine right now? When I know in a bit I'll want to die and it hurts bad
2959,depression,I'm losing my will.,"I'm completely new here, didn't really want to post anything, but I'm kind of desperate at this point. 

I'm not even sure if I have depression either, but I do get random breakdowns from a trivial reason; it's probably a buildup of what was happening.

My parents moved me from school to school frequently, and I lose friends as well as the ability to be social as it progresses. Once I'm shipped abroad to the US, it gets even harder. My friends speak a different language from me (Chinese), and they would constantly chat without me understanding. I've asked them sometimes, and they often don't tell me at all. It's a daily ordeal, to the point that I barely even exist in the group. Thus, I don't consider them as my friends; they're assistants I would say. Once there's no school, we basically do not have any attachment at all.

I got a boyfriend after a year. He's loving, almost too much. I wonder what I did to deserve all of those ""You're amazing"" phrases; I was simply doing homework the entire day while with him. I didn't do anything for him. Sometimes I felt that he's too touchy or needy and would think I'm a victim under his control, but once I searched for signs online... the signs of a controlling, toxic, and narcissistic person would assimilate to me more. I do not verbally or physically abuse him, but my seclusiveness(?) makes me uncomfortable whenever his friends are near us and talk to him. I never told him anything, but he notices and starts to spend more time with me and less with them. Isn't it toxic? Why can't he tone his love down?

Now that quarantine and summer are here, I'm trying to let go of him. He's having fun with others now, which is good for him. But now I have nobody. I'm far away from home. A relative took me in, but the husband for some reason does not like me. I do not feel welcome in here. I know there are too many problems, that's why I don't know what to do. I'm stressed, pathetic, every possible negative thing in one. The only thing that has barely pulled me out of these low episodes is my goal to grow up one day and repay my parents for the money they've spent on me. But now... even that is not helping. My life is so dull, and people either do not want my company or are badly influenced by me. I cannot find one thing to look forward to tomorrow. After a storm comes a rainbow, right? Then where is it?"
2960,depression,I feel like people meet me and think I’m chill then they get to know me and get dissapointed,"I just feel like a terrible person with terrible motives and behavior. I just don’t understand why people want to be around me and I genuinely feel like none of my friends like me and talk about me behind my back. I hate this feeling, I was doing really well and felt genuinely happy and then randomly depression just hit me like a truck. I remember the exact moment when it hit me, I was chilling just eating breakfast and then a moment later I was like fuck, it’s back."
2961,depression,I feel like I've got another mental health problem but I really don't want to self diagnose.,"I'm diagnosed BPD and depression, but in light of today's events I feel like I might have NPD too. I feel like I'm going to spiral again because people in my life are happy."

2963,depression,Fear of judgment,"I feel like I always say the wrong thing, like every word that comes out of me is fundamentally flawed and not ok. I feel like when I post on reddit my thoughts are just unacceptable to other people. There’s no evidence of it, I just assume. I don’t really know how to conform. I don’t have malevolent intentions but I just feel like people can get offended by anything. I feel like people have extra sensory abilities to judge others as bad and wrong. Why can’t people just be open and understand each other? I understand that people interpret meaning subjectively but it just makes me feel very constricted. I guess communicating through words isn’t always going to be interpreted as you expect. Maybe people like to take their negative emotions out on other people and I’m afraid to be one of those people. Maybe I should just delete reddit to avoid potential ridicule."
2964,depression,Those days where your whole body feels numb and floaty,"I was having a pretty usual night until I had a slight disagreement with a friend and it was fine at first but when I went to bed my social anxiety kicked in. The thoughts that I need to push everyone away kept me up so I went to scroll social media. I opened Twitter which was a big mistake because a really graphic sh pic showed up on my tl. Idk why because I don't look at that and although I don't usually get triggered by things online, this really upset me. I didn't sleep. I just feel so flat in my whole body. I plan on eating and existing until later so I can fall asleep early tonight. 
If anyone actually reads this thanks and sorry"
2965,depression,Utopia,"I can’t do this anymore. I could sleep forever at this point. To close my eyes and be at peace is all I want. But that’s impossible. I know it’s selfish but deep down I want be ignorant. 

I wish I didn’t know the horrors of the world and how terrible reality is. I wish I didn’t realize how cruel humans are. I wish I could do more. I wish I had the energy to do more than lay in bed. Most of all, I wish for this overwhelming guilt and anxiety to go away. It’s just feeds into my depression. I’m disgusted in myself for wishing all these things because truthfully I deserve it. I deserve to suffer the consequences and fix the corrupt world that my ancestors created. I know I am privileged yet I feel so useless because I cannot do enough to help those without it. Sure I sign every petition I come across but I can’t bring myself to protest and stand with my friends, neighbors, and strangers who are hurting the most. Large crowds cause anxiety spikes and my senses to overload and I end up having a panic attack. 

I know all of my wishes from before will never come true but if there was one thing I want most in the world would be peace. No more senseless death. No more murder. No more innocent people wounded or killed. No more racism. No more prejudice. No more assaults. No more stealing. No more brutality. 

My utopia will never happen in the real world but maybe just maybe when I close my eyes to eternally sleep I’ll see a world with love and peace. A world with everything I’ve ever wished for. 

One day, I’ll see my utopia."

2968,depression,I'm the reason why my mom isn't successful.,"My mom isn't a narcissist, I want to preface this post by saying that. She didn't make me feel this way, I made me feel this way.  

I'm 22 years old. My mom gave birth to me 9 months after graduation; and I'm paying my dues because I'm the reason she isn't what she wants to be in life. 

She wanted to be a professional musician, play French horn for orchestras around the world. My birth snuffed that dream, like a freshly lit candle. She couldn't go to college for music for very long because of me. My biological father left us before I could even walk or talk. We moved around a lot when I was younger, and she had a hard time finding love because I was a shithead kid. When I was in 2nd through 4th grade she was dating a man that abused me and her. He made her do vile things that I can only imagine how they haunt her now. I learned about the side I was ignorant of when I was moving out for work, at about 18. It wasn't until I was in 8th grade she met her husband, my stepdad. They had my half sister when I was 16. To their surprise she was healthy and everything was okay. I was not. I alienated her because she'd get a 'normal' upbringing; lessons learned from my mistakes wouldn't happen again. She's been lucky, I was not as lucky. 

How am I paying my dues? Atoning for the sin I committed by being born? By being who I am now. 
I'm awkward. Growing up I had a hard time making friends. One of the psychological reports I read in my medical record from when I was in behavioral therapy was; ""makes friends with younger kids because it's easy for him"" another I read was ""socially reclusive"" a few years later. As a 22 year old now I'm called ""fucking weird"", ""strange"", and ""the kind of person who grew up torturing small animals."" The latter I would never do nor have done; being known as that hurts me more than I can describe.
I'm paying my dues by being unable to make friends, to keep the few friends I have been able to make, to experience the human condition, to love. 

I want to be accepted, I want to be loved by people who aren't required to love me, I want to have friends that care for me as I do them. 
I hate being dejected, pushed out of a social circle, being called weird, and unwelcome. It's just something I have to come to terms with sooner rather than later.


If you read this far, thank you. I don't expect this to be very visible or well read. I wish my mom knew how sorry I am for my existence."
2969,depression,Tragedy,"As of now very few WW2 veterans are alive today, especially German WW2 veterans. Nobody truly appreciates the scale of war, manpower, destruction. Ignorants surrounded by media, pop culture and only to call nazi when they see a German veteran.

 Nobody cares or tries to understand the loss of men at stalingrad and Eastern front. Memories of WW2 vets are fading with them and no one fucking cares. Its nothing more than another chapter in history for these people. 
Imagine living a life as German soldier, the already bloody war at eastern front and incoming attack from west, you are constantly fighting, no time rest, its been years since you've seen your home for the last time. Once a victorious war machine, now surrounded by enemies. 
No time to relax, fighting day and night, having to see your comrades torn apart before your eyes, always retreating and surrounded.
There's not a single reason to be happy, you can't even cry; you got no time to cry anyway. 
Lost all territores from west to east, millions of lives wasted for.. what?
They're now planning a attack on Germany itself, little to no hope but you still fight to a bitter end. 

All this to be called a Nazi and seen as ""bad guy"". Nobody really appreciates your sacrifice. 75 years later only to get called Nazi again by some random fuckhead on internet.

And yet this isn't the only tragic thing. It is that, We're losing WW2 veterans faster than ever. They are dying quickly. I will never be able to shake hands with any WW2 veteran, its killing me from inside.


ETERNAL GLORY TO EVERY WW2 SOLDIER. YOU WILL NEVER BE FORGOTTEN!! R.I.P"
2970,depression,Is there really purpose in life?,"I don’t think who I am matters but recently I’ve been just thinking about life. Why does life have to be unfair and cruel? Why does life want to make me feel like an anxious piece of shit all the time? Why can’t i be told what to do? I feel so hopeless all the time. I just feel trapped and I can’t shake the feeling off even when around friends. I don’t know what will make me feel better. Maybe I want to start a new life probably go to Canada or something but that’s only a fever dream. I can never do that so I’m trapped here. Wasting my life with jealously and envy. I can’t control these feelings and I don’t wanna keep trying to put my head up and feel better. The world is on fire which doesn’t help at all. I truthfully don’t know why I keep trying, I have no really friends or support. I want to be proud of myself but I just can’t. I hate it here. I hate me."
2971,depression,I almost feel ignored and shoved to the side.,"Protests are going on obviously, not gonna say much else about it other than it’s a generally a good thing most of them are fighting for (holding everyone to the same standards). However I just can’t shrug off the idea that no one even cares about what I have to deal with, a really severe stutter. Then there’s a lot of posts talking to the entire white demographic saying how they’re privileged. I am not fucking privileged man. Every aspect of my life, my stutter has seethed into and made it harder and more heartbreaking. This is not to say I’m glad people are standing up for what’s right or that I would even want a “protest” for stuttering (that could be kind of weird), it’s just a thought that comes up in my mind a lot."
2972,depression,Alone,I know I’m just 16 but every time I watch love movies or shows I just feel broken. The last person I gave that kind of trust to abused me and gaslit me for years. I’m not popular or funny or good looking and I have autism. I feel so unlovable and I know I’m gonna be alone for the rest of my life or wind up in an abusive relationship one day because I’m that desperate. I can’t connect to people and that’s going to be my downfall
2973,depression,"I haven’t posted in a long time, but I really need someone right now.","I feel very broken and lost, I tried to give my life to God and change and be a better person. I was able to abandon my addiction for marijuana and the need to numb my pain. I’ve tried to be a better woman, someone who is worthy of being a wife. I’ve tried to show everyone how much I love and care for them and would do anything for them. I’ve feel constantly attacked for my sins and like I’ll never be good enough for anything, anyone, even God if I can’t accept everything the Bible say. I’ve been going to a church where I recommitted to God and learned a lot, but that has also very much hurt me, refused to listen or have a real conversation, and most recently has made me want to leave the faith completely. It seems that I have no where to turn, I don’t want to call a help line rn cause I have too much anxiety to even speak words right now and I am in so much emotional pain. If someone can please reach out to me. Even if it’s just to tell me the simple words I’ll be okay, it would mean a lot. I feel so alone. I feel so helpless. Was this all for nothing? I feel so broken."

2975,depression,Do I want to die or not?,"I don't think I've ever been so confused on how I feel. The last 4 years for me have been a huge struggle, with mental healing and twice as much mental damage. I'm clinically diagnosed with Bipolar depression, general anxiety and PTSD (and don'tget me wrong I'vedealt with this far before this time in my life.) Within the last 4 years ive had my mother choose an abusive man over me, got us evicted from our home overnight and had to move in with a friend whose family I had only met once prior. My father completely cut me off and blame me for the death of my grandmother (we didn't get along so he figured I wanted her to die.) And within this time get into my first serious relationship where I was dumped twice, the first time, the day before a foot surgery that left me unable to walk for 7 months. The second time, the end of last year, a month after our 2 year anniversary, with his ex girlfriend. I had only found out because a mutual friend sent me the screenshots and hotel receipts. Needless to say I stayed.. I have no where to go, no one to talk to and no family to ""burden"". Within these last 4 years I have felt so absolutely worthless and depressed but I'm also so scared of dying. When I get a bad depressive episode I feel like I could finally pull through but I'm too scared to do it, what if it gets better? It's not just relationships and daddy issues, it's  all of the feelings of self loathing, guilt, and worthlessness that has been brought up from it. I just don't know where to go from here. I'm sorry."

2978,depression,Covid,"I know you all are probably tired of hearing about the pandemic already. 

But I have noticed I do have more than a few symptoms of Covid-19 (missing a few key ones, thankfully)

Some of these being ones that I haven’t even heard until I looked into it. 

And I’m praying that I don’t have it. 

My immune system isn’t the best and it could take me longer to recover than a healthy person.

And I have seen healthy people’s bodies become destroyed by it.

It is said likely that athletes who contract the virus likely won’t be able to compete in their sport anymore. I’m a dancer and it is my whole life, if I have to give that up I won’t have much else to live for. 

It’s likely I’m being a hypochondriac, but I’ve admittedly not been as careful as I should be. Yes, I wear a mask when I go out, I wash my hands and use hand sanitizer frequently, but I haven’t been diligent about not touching items in stores too much and I have always been one to touch my face a lot and it’s a habit I can’t seem to break.

Not only could I lose my livelihood from this, I’ve likely given it to everyone in my house too.

“damn got a $600 traffic ticket today. well at least it wasn’t a traffic accident and i’m not in a full body cast in the hospital”. 

“my family has always been poor and i live in a high poverty area. well at least i wasn’t born into some third world village where i’d be slowly dying of lack of necessities”. 

“someone broke into my house while i was away and stole $5,000 worth of stuff. well at least my family and i weren’t there when it happened and didn’t get harmed or killed”. 

“my state has been on lockdown for months and im going crazy. well at least im not in a north korean detainment camp working 15 labor hours a day on a life sentence for voicing my opinion”.

I get stages almost every night, and I think about ending it frequently. I don’t do it, since I don’t want to hurt my family. I just feel like nobody really understands me. I have always struggled making friends, and those I do only care about themselves. I have a therapist, but I feel like she has an opinion and will judge me badly. I am really failing high school, and my parents get really mad, which usually triggers my depression. I don’t think anyone knows that I struggle, and I don’t think I can reveal it. All I really want it a friend, who supports me, and understands me. I want to have a friend that I can support through rough times, but everyone I meet seems to be selfish and shallow.

2990,depression,I'm sick of people associating depression with being a loser,[removed]
2991,depression,I'm getting where I feel like everyones against me.,"I know the title sounds like every basic sad story.. I'm literally sitting on my bed after getting screamed at my mom because i felt anxious for talking to her. Everyone i ever knew around me seemed to always act like they cared about me when they just only turned around and made me feel like I'm the most evil person to them. I'm 18 going on 19 in July, and still not in college, still don't have a high school diploma. I never had any help after my mom was frantic about me being bullied in elementary school even though it didn't bother me much. She decided to put me into home schooling when i was around 10 or so.. everything was fine until i turned 12, my depression started since i was getting neglected and both me and my mother argued almost every single day and night.

My mom was always the best mother you could ask for that actually showed she cared.. my father always seemed to dislike me ever since i was born, even his family were the same. My mom was 42 when she had me, so she already had a lot of life's experiences, had 2 children before me from an abusive relationship and had already been in the military serving as a Sergeant. Her whole life was basically Depression with a lot of PTSD.. and you think a person that handled it everyday would understand her own daughters view. I feel alone all the time, i feel like I'm in a prison. I hate crying and talking about how i feel because i try my best to ignore it.

I get where i feel like everyone is the same in this world.. nobody cares if someone is in pain. I feel like my crying doesn't even matter. I always tried my best to be nice and show I'm always there for someone no matter the situation.. but I'm the one that always gets blown over and get hated for. Ever since i was 12 years old, i thought about suicide.. i started to get schizophrenia since i stayed at home for 5 years, never going outside at all. People would laugh at me like i wasn't serious.. i was so full of anger and sadness that i wanted to escape and run away. But i was scared to.. i didn't know where to go and i was too scared to try and kill myself.

My mother always ignored my problems, i literally begged her to send me to a hospital because of how bad i was getting.. i needed change. But she wouldn't do it, saying that I'm fine when i really wasn't. I constantly argued to myself, had brutal nightmares and heard voices around me, and i seen shadows. I would cut my wrists everytime i felt like i deserved it.. it was my only punishment. I started getting into writing to escape from reality but instead of writing about something happy, it was always horror. In April 12th 2014, my house caught on fire. I don't even know if it was demons or if it was my own fault.. but till this day i still feel like i should have burnt to death. Because everyday I'm suffering.. we lived in a county then when the house caught on fire and it was already pretty old.. almost 100 years old. People from a nearby neighborhood laughed as they watched the house burnt.. that was such an awful time. I thought things would have gotten better after that.. it did for a little, both me and my parents finally got back together. I was 14 when i decided to go back to public school but that didn't last long since i hated everything about it, teachers acted like they didn't care and thought i would never make it to 8th grade which spoiler alert, i did.

I went back to home schooling which of course i never did do my work. My parents never tried helping me anyways just because they thought they didn't need to, i had problems learning in the first place. I got back to being suicidal again and spoke to older men online.. that were around 23-26 years old. I actually tried to purposely get myself kidnapped and i didn't care about the consequences, i just wanted someone to end my life for me. I snuck and drank my fathers beer a lot so i could drown my sadness.. of course he found out and screamed at me for it saying my life isn't bad and called me a bitch for it. You'd think at first maybe he finally realized but no.. he only cared about his narcissistic self and his beer.

When i turned 15 i got manipulated into thinking i was in love with a 17 year old boy.. he raped me but of course i didn't do or say anything about it. I was already out of my mind and numb. My parents kinda knew what was happening since he always stayed at our house for weeks on end.. i didn't want him there but my parents did nothing. And every night he would do things. I even thought i was pregnant since i got so sick.. i hated myself so much. But i finally told him i wanted him to leave, he got upset and had older friends stalk my house almost every night until my neighbor got his gun to scare them off.

I suffered so much after that and mom acted like it was nothing.. like it didn't bother me, the constant thoughts of remembering everything. After that i actually ran away to my sisters home for a month, but i was only there to take care of her kids. I got high a lot since she was known to be the one in our family to have weed. And then i finally went home since I was homesick.. i started thinking my mom really hated me since both her and my sister talked behind my back on the phone, thinking i didn't know.

I went to church a lot, i forgot to mention.. that's where i met my manipulator. I thought God would actually help me for once.. and show me something. But i never grew enough hope. Then at 16, i tried to hang myself from my fan, i only had string lights. But i couldn't get myself to do it.. but i probably knew that it wouldn't hold anyways. I cried for hours on my floor as our dog scratched at my door.. my dad shouting at him to stop. Then finally my mom came in and saw what i did, but said nothing and asked me some stupid question that had nothing to do with it. That's when i was officially done with everyone.. i just wanted to die and that was it.. but i was scared and didn't know what to do, i always wanted SOMEONE to actually show they cared about me. Because i was always there for THEM. It was always them first and not me and I'm sick of it.. 

And finally at 17 years old i thought i was in love with my soulmate. I cared about him so god damn much but it wasn't enough since i still had my own problems.. and that was his excuse, he hated when i cried. I visited him all the way to New York for months.. helping his family, helping him with a summer job. And i hoped we had a future together.. but things fell apart so fast as he started getting emotionally abusive, i didn't want to go home because of money.. i thought about killing myself there by jumping off a high balcony and he would only get angry at me for it instead of being understanding. His therapist told him he shouldn't be a caretaker for me when i didn't even want that in the first place, the problem was that he got distant from me and didn't SHOW that he loved me. Which he clearly didn't since he moved on with another girl pretty quickly after he broke up with me because of his mother telling him lies and actually handled our breakup.

 And even now that I'm 18.. i still can't get over it. After our breakup, i got to the point that i never left my bed.. i hardly ate and cried constantly for months and i only just wanted to die. I got back into my cutting habits, cutting so deep into my skin with a razor, playing life or death. Everything was my fault as always.. that's my entire life. At some point at the beginning of February i started getting a little better.. but it never stays that way. My best friend argued with me over a dumb reason because I'm too weird.. so now we don't talk, and my other friend hardly talks to me anyways. I literally have nobody at this point. I have such big dreams of being an Archaeologist and going on adventures.. but i have so much weakness that I'm losing every single hope by the day. People always said it will get better, but it only got worse. I'm always the one that's sorry.. I'm always the one thats here for myself even though i hate myself so much. I'm always crying for help when i feel like i can never do something right..but nobody never comes to the rescue to give me enough hope to keep going.

I really hate being this sad of a person when i always try to be uplifting and happy.. but its so hard when inside i feel empty and broken in pieces. I always tried to be a good person but bad things still end up happening and I'm getting where i feel like i deserve the hate.. even though i don't want to keep living like this. I rather end it if it keeps up.. i have nobody to rely on or talk to about what's happening.. i don't like seeming selfish or annoying, it's something i am constantly paranoid about. I just feel like a shitty person for being depressed. I can't ever talk to my mom about my problems anymore, because its always the same ""I don't know what to say"" even though she will feel bad for other people and wishing she could do something.. even though I'm right here. She never hugs me anymore and genuinely says she loves me. I feel like I don't matter at all. 

Anyways, I'm sorry for the SUPER long post, i have so much on my mind from all these months of not talking to someone.. its just getting to my head and i don't know what to do anymore. I want to find a place to live but I'm too scared and i have no money.. I'm scared of a lot of things. I always tried to put on the tough act but its not enough apparently.. I'm just so sick and wish i had support.. i just don't know how other people that had much worse situations can do it. I know this post isn't going to be a miracle of fixing my problems but at least i get to let everything out even if thousands of people see it.. I'm just so tired."

2996,depression,Lately my depression's gotten worse,"I don't want to bother anyone with this anymore so I decided to let it all out here in hopes it would make me feel better.
I've had periods in my life when I had been suicidal and kept thinking about it. I have a thyroid illness that messes up my hormones so I get depressed often. But lately I've been kind of numb again. And I honestly don't feel much. Things that would make me happy and hopeful don't anymore. I just keep thinking about wanting to die and kill myself. And I'm really lonely. I've grown attached to my boyfriend and I rely on him a lot, but he wants to distance himself. He said he doesn't want to meet up as often as I'd like to. For him it would be ok if we met every 3 weeks or so. And I don't really have friends or a close bond with my family. So I just spend my days in my room watching videos on youtube and playing games. And then at the end of the day I start getting thoughts about how lonely I am and how I don't want to live anymore. But I still haven't done everything I wanted to in life, although I'm not sure it's worth living anymore. I always saw myself as a happy scientist in the future but that dream fell apart. I wanted to live abroad, get a scholarship, student exchange, anything, but now I'm just stuck here and miserable. Everything I wanted in life didn't happen and I fucked it all up. I can't even finish my degree because I'm too stupid. I have no social skills and no friends. Honestly what's the point anymore?
I'm 25 now and I've had depression on and off for the last 12 years and I'm just done with it. I don't think I can take life anymore. Every day I find new stuff to bring me down. I don't sleep much. And I just want that to end."

But I’ve completed a masters degree, working on a pension, a great apartment, great dog but I just feel so incomplete.

Thanks!"
2999,depression,i broke up with my best friend,"i’m not looking for advice, i already made the decision. you can call me irrational but i felt i had to do it. i always tried to prioritize my best friend above all people but as time went on he shifted his focus away from me and onto a new friend who’s an ass, and after lots of exclusions arguments hypocrisy and a general feeling of betrayal, i told him i didn’t want to be friends any longer. i didn’t want to say “pick him or me” i wanted to get out. i will definitely be doing a lot of drinking and i will try to cry although it is very hard for me these days. anyone else have a similar experience? i don’t have any friends to turn to so i’m all ears for any stories."
3000,depression,"how to deal with ""sympathy friends""?","i have 2 (kinda) friends total. theyre both girls who i friendzoned off tinda' when i used to think girls were the answer to my problems. theyve both helped me out when ive been suicidal and been there with me when i was down. but thats about it.

theyll talk me down off a cliff but wont help me down the mountain.

they both arent people who id talk to regularly (if i had a social life). one's obsessed with tinder and bodycounts and callherdaddy and pretending to have a social life and the other is a bit of a prefect nerd in a nursing program who i have very little in common with.

theyre ok girls its just they dont do ""friend shit"" with me. they dont laugh at my jokes, they dont like what i like, and they dont talk like me. i have to be someone im not when im with them. thats if i by grace of God i get a chance to hangout with them! i have to ask every single fucking time and both of em have ignored me for months on end (when i have texted them) coming back with bs excuses about not seeing messages or losing their phone (and trust me ik its bs). and if i dont text or call they dont say shit back. and its always either at uni or because they have nothing better to do. never to parties or clubs or anything, never on weekends.

im 19 with depression and social anxiety (possibly autism) but i just want are buddies (preferably male) to shoot the shit with, ride my bike with, weave thru traffic, run reds, shred trails, drink in bars, go camping, watch sports, go out on weekends, go to concerts, climb shit, lift with, laugh at people. is all that too much to ask?

i dont want friends just to have friends, im way past that insecurity in my life, i couldnt be fucked what other people think of me. i hate nerds and the fucking internet, i hate the fact that the only reason im alive right now is because i managed to convince a bunch of girls on tinda' to sleep with me and how that had to be my first everything.

 im so fucking tired of living my life thru a screen, i just want friends. im so alone.

if i delete these girls contact ill have no one, and id feel bad if i did, they really helped me in dark times. 

(sorry if this is vulgar i have a hatred for this website but i have nowhere else to put this shit, /adv/ never helps)"
3001,depression,This lockdown is ruining me,"I have been in a bad state mentally since middleschool, reason is that i was just too addicted to video games. Instead of doing stuff i was just sitting at home playing games. My brother and all of my friends were gamers so i never thought anything bad of it, since everybody was doing it. My grades kept declining but i always managed to pass everything when needed. Nothing changed after highschool, kept repeating the same stupid mistakes, always secluded at home, rarely doing stuff except going to the gym from time to time. When i started college i became even more depressed, until i couldn't do it longer. I said no more. I really wanted to make a change in my life. I sold my PC which was easily the hardest decision i've ever done. It was basically my life and selling it really hurt.    That was like a year ago, first i got a job, i wanted to find something where i could make money and learn for university at the same time. Then i took my fitness more seriously which did wonders for my self esteem, i found a local gaming bar where i would go play some games once every thursday night because i wanted get a healthier relationship with gaming and playing outside of your house really helps with this addiction while you can also meet new people. I even started my drivers license which i could pay off easily with my job. Everything was going splendid, i was becoming happy for the first time in my life. And when i got the results back for my exams and saw that i have passed, i was ecstatic. Everything worked perfectly and i could finally see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

But then corona happened. At first i didn't think it would affect me that much, i could study and work out at home i thought, i was a changed man i thought. That was 2 months ago and i haven't done a single pushup. I can't sit down and concentrate for shit, i can't continue my drivers license and i am starting to procrastinate my studies as always. I wanted to change my life but now i am back to my old miserable self. It feels like everything i worked for the past year was for naught. I hate this so much. If i don't pass my exams this semster i don't know what to do with my life. 

Just wanted to get it off my chest. Fuck this goddamn virus."
3002,depression,Have everything and don’t care,"From the outside I have everything most people could want. Great family, beautiful amazing spouse, awesome son. Material wise we have what dreams are made of. Dream house, all new cars and other items. We make enough to never have to worry about daily needs or even most expenses and...

I wish I could walk away from it all. I drag through every day with little happiness and just hate every moment. 

I have been this way for 15 years and all of the meds, doctors, exercise, meditation has done nothing to change it."
3003,depression,spacing out constantly,"so, when I'm in the real world (ie not in front of a computer) I tend to become very very spacey the point where it can seriously interfere with my daily functioning, it almost feels like numbness... it also interferes with personality expression. how do I stop this? I'm not on any medication aside from birth control... what causes this? is there a class of antidepressants I can talk with my doctor about? I've taken several SSRIs and none of them fixed this specific symptom."
3004,depression,I’m spiraling again,After weeks of doing better it’s getting out of control fuck I want to die

3006,depression,I don’t know if I’m depressed.,"Thought I’d ask for some opinions because honestly? I’m lost. I’m lost and I’m scared to tell anyone about it cause I think they’ll just brush it off as just “I’m having an episode” or something. Here’s some changes in habits I’ve noticed:

- I either get too much sleep or too little sleep. No matter how long I sleep for, I wake up tired.

- I feel like I’m connecting less and less with my close friends and family. Especially my family.

- I’ve lost motivation to do little to any school work. I procrastinate to hell and back.

- I’ve been consistently crying/tearing up in come form or capacity for the last roughly 4 months (usually at night in bed).

- I’m not hungry as often as I used to be. Like I’ll eat one meal and not eat for almost an entire day and even then I won’t be hungry.

- I feel like I’m trying too hard to please everyone that I’m not myself anymore.

Am I just “going through a phase”? I don’t recall any important events that happened that might’ve cause this."
3007,depression,I wrote this poem when I felt I was being trapped by my own self," 

# Last Chance 

So cold in this prison 

Constricted to a mission

Of lost hope and all those dreams

They seem to mean nonsense

They see me and I see there lies

I see their piercing eyes 

They want me and they take my soul

They take everything that once was bold 

They take your happiness 

They leave you alone 

Lose you will and your soul

Although the end is near don’t see the failure that brought you near

The end is sweet and I can taste it from here 

The chaos is roaming near

It’s wants you please don’t hide

The last thing it wants is for you to confide"
3008,depression,Therapist wasn't interested in helping,"Today we had a less than 1 hour session because I had run out of things to talk about. I got so tired in the middle of our call that I just went to lay on my bed. 

I am quite surprised that this therapist did not even bother to give me any mental health screening. She just kept pushing coping tools on me to a point that I wanted to scream. Did I not tell you that I couldn't cope and my stress had manifested in physical symptoms? Even the volunteers I spoke to on a hotline was more invested in my wellbeing than she is.

I'm shaking and working hard to stop myself from spiralling right now. Idk if this is a normal interaction with a therapist during an exceptionally bad day. I feel even more helpless right now."
3009,depression,I want a free girlfriend,"Im feeling hella lonely and bored. I wish I had someone to be with, I wish I could be in love with a person that loves me back. That shit aint never gonna work though, I tried once and failed miserably. Love isnt as easy as it seems."
3010,depression,Don’t know how to make anything right,"I had a child at 17. The dude broke my bones and we separated after 3 kids. Id attained a degree in the meantime, but it turns out I didn’t do well enough to pursue psychology any further and I don’t want to go to school anymore. 

I remarried. No wedding. Again. Endless disappointments. 

It feels like no matter what i do, I can’t find female friends. My husband doesn’t want to have sex with me anymore. I am not unattractive. Idk what to do abt a career. Everything I want to do is out of reach.
But I think the hardest thing to deal with.... is the feeling that I will never ever get any of it back. I won’t get those meaningful moments that I missed out on. My narcissistic mother let me down time and again, two abusive or narcissistic husbands ... same thing. My only love in this world died last year, my grandmother. I feel so alone. I am so alone.
I’ve tried churches... I’ve tried various meetups.
My life is a train wreck and I can’t relate to others. I’ve never had a wedding. Never been on any special vacations. Never felt.... love. Just felt used and angry. I’m so tired of this. I’m just so tired.
I can’t get back the births of my kids. Or my wedding or anniversary or all those nonexistent dates. It’s like I’m just not important enough to anyone and I’m on the outside looking in. I’m so lost"
3011,depression,"I wish I could undo my life. A year, 5 years, the whole fucking thing","I want to go back a year where i was in my old job and talked to friends, and not now where I feel crappy and cant even text someone without feeling like a bother. Back before I was in a job where I'm constantly stressed and alone.

I want to go back to when I was in school. Had a group of friends a relationship. Something I doubt I'll have again, that long term bond with a group Or having a best friend. Someone to be close with. Any friend I make now, im just on the outside, they have people they grew up with and are closer with. No room for new people.

I wish I didnt lose friends constantly and always ruin what I had. I get depressed, isolate myself and mess it up everytime something good happens. I'm tired of feeling so shit, and being stuck in quarantine just makes everything so much harder.
Maybe things will change. I hope :/"
3012,depression,I'm trying to figure out if I have Manic/Bipolar Depression or just Anxiety,"\[F21\] I have been showing symtoms for Manic or Bipolar Depression over the last year. I do have high highs and low lows. My personality is pretty reserved most of the time but when I'm depressed I am in this feeling for days or weeks durning my highs I am more hyper, talkitive, and I wouldn't say risky as much as straight forward and harsh. It's putting a strain on my homelife and relationship with my parents. Most days I find myself sleeping or just moping around I have school work to do but I find my mind wanting to do other things instead of focusing. I have been taking my current medication for depression but I don't think I have to correct dignosis because I can't afford to go to see therapist without my loved ones knowing since they do not agree I need medication they think it is a phase I am sure it is not. I mostly am bringing my posts here because I am confused and have never really used reddit. I honestly wanted to vent because I am sick of annoying my friends with my problems."

I'm hoping for a miracle to happen, and that if there's a god out there, they'd help all of us, even for just this one time.

I want him to make more happy memories. I want him and my mom to fix their relationship and be happy again. I want to drive him to places once I lear how to drive. I want to do so many things with him, and I want to be a better daughter to him.

I want my mom to hear some good news, she's already been through so much after losing 2 precious relatives in a span of days. I want her to at least feel reassured that everything is ok despite working in such a bleak situation (she is a nurse). I want her to stay healthy and strong.

I wish everything will be fine. Please..."
3015,depression,I can't stop replaying what happened with my ex. I also think I am getting more and more socially anxious and distant.,"Wind back a year, I was happier. I had started a job and my ex and I were still together. We were strongly in love. My social life was going well. 

Now, it's been 7 months since she left me. But the whole breakup has been replaying in my head over and over and over and over. Not a day goes by that I don't feel like a failure. 

Ever since the breakup I've felt socially torn. Now that COVID has struck, I'm even more socially anxious. For the first time in about 2 months, I met two new people and let me tell you I have never felt so uncomfortable in my life. It's not them, they were very nice and kind, but my head was all over the place. It started ringing with shit my ex's brother had told my ex, that I was awkward and he felt uncomfortable.

It really makes me overthink my social interactions now. I know I should just forget about it and move on, but that's what I am struggling to do. I feel so uneasy, depressed, sad. I wish I could just die."

3018,depression,I don't know how long I can do this garbage,"I might somehow not be driven to commit suicide this summer, but Idk how much more I can take being this unhinged.

3019,depression,Diabetes and depression,"For the past three years I've been progressively caring less and less about my diabetes. I've not been so far gone to try to take my life or anything but I haven't been happy in years. Everyday I wake up I'm sore, tired, weak, I feel hallow I don't enjoy my job, I feel as though my life has been in a stalemate I haven't progressed at all in my life in three years. I'm not a open person my girlfriend is amazing she tries to be understanding for my situation but I won't let her in and it takes a toll on her and that hurts me too because I love her. I don't understand why I've been so stagnant in my life for the past three years I have no goals I don't care about anything I wake up go to work hate it go home play video games and rinse repeat the only time I ever feel a shred of happiness is playing games and I'm only happy if I'm performing well in them other than that I'm mad at myself for playing poorly for what I don't know, I have trouble communicating how I'm feeling I can't say it out loud I physically can't I change the subject but when it has anything to do about how I'm feeling and I'm just so lost I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know if it's depression or what I've tried to tell my endocrinologist because they ask you ""how often do you feel bad""? That whole questionare and I said that I think I might be depressed and they basically ignored it I just don't know what I'm supposed to do who or how I'm supposed to talk to someone so I can progress in my life I'm just so lost.

Sorry for the text wall just don't know what to do.
I'm a 24M living at home, not really trying to talk to my parents about this just seems like another complicated situation to add to my already rubix cube of issues."

3021,depression,Very Happy I Found This Community.,"Hi everyone, brand new to this subreddit and Reddit in general. I just moved a few states away from my hometown in search of a better life. I guess running away from my past in essence. And I’m happy to have found this group, hopefully I can get to interact with a lot of you and make some new friends. Life seems a bit challenging at the moment. I have a 2 year old daughter who I haven’t been able to see, my ex (her mom) keeps moving to a new location when I threaten court. And I don’t really have the money for a family lawyer. So I’m here in hopes of finding a new life and a better way of income to actually settle this dispute. It’s been really mentally rough on me. And my old therapist didn’t help much. And I’m a bit anti-social. So I hate trying to explain myself to friends and family. I hope this is a good place to share. And I look forward to hearing your stories. Anyway, I just wanted to vent a little and introduce myself. Hope everyone gets a little more happiness than yesterday."

3027,depression,Sometimes you just need one thing,"I'm sitting here talking to friends and family members, just trying to get someone to admit they are here for me. I just need to hear it, or at least be shown it. There are other things going on but they can't help with them, I just need someone to act like they care and talk to me about it even if they have no advice. But no one will.

Just so I know what it's like not living with fucking depression. People don't know it, but I am severely depressed and lonely.

On the exterior, people think I'm just a normal guy, but what they don't know is I'm 36 without a girlfriend or family or anything meaningful. I have an okay job, but, again, this God damn depression and the cocktail of drugs I'm taking are making me forgetful and losing myself. On top of all these heavy weights bearing down on me, life decided to take my only source of solace and comfort in my dog--whom I loved with all my heart--in a car accident. So fucking cruel! And it seems like everything I touch turns to shit. Can I have a moment of the Midas touch? Please? 

Fuck you, depression and anxiety! Fuck you!  You've robbed me of life! I'm staring at becoming 40 without anything to show for it. I'm staring at life blankly. I'm staring at a reflection of who I am not. Why me? Why?!?!?! Fuck!!! Argh!!!!!"

I know well enough it's my fault that I didn't pass and it's because I don't believe in myself at all, I had no motivation I always end the day thinking I wish I was just dead and it would be better if someone else replaced me and because of that I don't get any work done I wish I could've just had someone to talk about it with and my parents won't bother because all they just say is ""Its just like this"" or ""I've gone through that too"", Me dead? Its not gonna affect the world at all just the people I'm close to, if I had any. I'm not smart, I've been bullied so much for being stupid when I was so young I was convinced anything I do is stupid,I have no talent and in these 6 years of college I only got carried, I got what I deserved. I'm still at the starting line and my friends have all reached the finish line, they all graduated and have careers. I just wish I didn't exist at all maybe everyone's lives would have been better"

I could watch my own damn funeral and break down because whoever tries to speak about what I went through in my last few days, months, years, would just be so full of shit because not a single damn one of them has can say they know. Not one fucking person would be able to say they reached out to me or asked how I've been doing. But they can damn sure tell you I checked on them. I dont want to look the devil in the eyes, but my will to live already died... Now I'm just fucking here."
3032,depression,It doesn’t matter what I do,"No matter what I try, I’ll end up with the same outcome. I’ll disappoint people as I go and I won’t make anything special of myself. Only that I’ll know special people but never be one myself. I can’t stand to be with the guy I like because of how loved he is. I hate other people and can’t be around them. So I can’t drag him down with me. I’d hate myself for that. I want him to be happy. I’ve only been a fraud around him just to get him to talk to me but the truth is that I suck.

I guess I’ve been clinging onto idea and people to help get me through this but that doesn’t seem to work and I keep on getting hurt. I feel inadequate in everything I do lately, even drawing, which I love but I’m total shit. Now I feel like I’m just waisting my time away. Waiting to work a job to get an apartment and.. what? What will I ever make or do or say to leave an impact? What am I even working towards? Just existing and hoping some people I meet will give me some sense of meaning to my life?

3035,depression,Hope for The Future,"honestly, the only reason I haven't completely given up is because I'm hopeful for the future. I'm 15 now, a teenager. Life is exhausting right now. Maybe it's because of quarantine and they say that quarantine is mentally draining for those with mental illnesses.

However, I think that it's going to get better once I become an adult, when I don't have to go to school, can move out, and have the freedom to do what I want. My life in high school has been pretty average, or even below average on some days. I don't have as many close friends as others because I'm an introvert. I overthink way too much which causes my relationship with other people to become damaged. I just want to skip teenage years and turn 18. At eighteen, you're almost an adult. You don't have to deal with the pressure of school and grades anymore. You can go out on nights and actually live life. You can have your own house or even move in with your best friend. You can sleep in on weekends without your parents forcing you to get up at 9 in the morning. *You can actually live life.*

I don't know if it actually gets better or not because adults always say to treasure your childhood because you'll never get it back. But I think it would certainly be better than right now. I may be right, I may not. Only time will tell."
3036,depression,I'm an empty shell of a person,"Somewhere along the way I lost my personality. I cut of contact with extended family, stop speaking to my mom, stop hanging out with friends and just fully immersed myself in business.  

I had a great childhood, born to a high income family, and then my parents got divorced. A nasty divorce it was. 

Instead of taking the divorce like a man, my dad became self destructive and waged a war on my mom. He let our house go into foreclosure instead of finding a buyer. He spend hundereds of thousands of dollars making sure she got as little money as possible. He talked bad about her to us and he never spoke to her again even though they had 4 children together still under 18.

It's difficult to explain all the little things that changed but everything either went abruptly to shit and I didn't have time to react to it, or it went to shit very slowly and didn't realize it. 

Nevertheless I bottled everything inside and tried to remain optimistic. I went from going to a private school my whole life to going to a public school. I was actually happy to be leaving all my friends behind even though we all knew each other since preschool. I wanted to get away from everyone that knew me. 

While my dad was being self destructive I moved in with my mom and I quickly adapted to public school. Eventually making new friends, new enemies and talking to new girls. I got kicked out my first year and was transferred to another school to finish 7th grade. At that new school, I got kicked out after 2 months and missed the rest of the school year. 

I started 8th grade at a new middle school and started living with my dad after I got into a petty fight with my mom. My mom moved to another state with two of my sister's and things started to feel stable again. I met a girl in the new school and even though we were young, we were in love. Our relationship was on and off but didn't last much through us going to different high schools, me starting to do drugs and becoming emotionally unstable. 

I started going out with another girl who eventually cheated on me with my best friend while all our other friends knew which made me feel humiliated. A few weeks after that I broke my leg in a late night biking accident while I was drunk and high missing the first part of 11th grade. This is the point where I could say that I lost my personality.

My middle school girlfriend visited me in the hospital and it made me so happy to see her. After I recovered I told her that I still loved her but she was wise to see that I wasn't a stable person. It's been almost 10 years since I have been with her and I don't think I been happy since. Of the few girlfriends I had in high school, none of them made me feel the way I felt when I was with her. 

As the years went on I struggled for a long time wondering if I was in love with her or if I was in love with the thought of her. I think I still struggle with this almost 10 years later. I have dreams about her occasionally.

Anyways, my leg recovered and I went back to school but I stopped associating with most people. I felt so humiliated from breaking my leg and having my girlfriend cheat on me with my best friend while all my other friends knew. I quickly got my GED and left school in 11th grade and started working and going to community college. 

In community college, I was the best student I could be but  struggled with talking to girls and meeting new people. I became such an awkward person. In my third semester there my dad got a heart attack while at work and had to get a triple bypass. I became more depressed and used his heart attack as an excuse to leave my job,eave school and start working with him. His business at that point was a shell of what it once was before the divorce but he invented a novel item and started doing better in the market. 

At this point I was smoking weed everyday by myself or with group of friends. We were all losers so I felt comfortable hanging out with them. 

As business became better with my dad's company and I was becoming more successful, I slowly started ditching every last one of my friends. I had no more contact with my extended family and I had stopped talking to my mom. 

My entire life was literally Business, smoking weed by myself, watching Netflix, and browsing reddit. Nothing else. At some point when things got more serious with the business, I threw away my paraphernalia and stopped smoking weed. But I was already at the point of having no friends and no personality. No experiences, no dates, or anything that would resemble a social life. 

People will ask me sometimes if I have girlfriend and I get nervous and feel shitty about myself. 
 
I am 27 now, live at home with my Dad, sister, and my nephew. My sister's boyfriend works for me so I go to work and see him and my dad, then come home and see them again. 

My happiness and emotional stability is 100% tied to how business is going that day. I watch a lot of porn or use tinder to look at girls without any expectation of ever going on a date. Before the pandemic, I was going to the gym but I coudn't bring myself to talk to anyone. 

In December I randomly matched with the girl I fell in love with in middle school but all I could say was ""You look awfully familiar"" and we she responded with a pet name she had for me and a exclamation mark. I couldn't respond back. 

I am so ashamed of myself and have no confidence to even have a conversation with her when we matched on Tinder. 

No matter how much money I make I will always feel like a loser. 

I have days where I kid myself thinking everything is going to be ok and others where I become extremely depressed and wishing I would suddenly die. More and more often I think of myself in a suicidal scenario or curse myself out loud. 

I was having one of those moments before I started to write this post. I decided to write this because I don't have anyone that knows me that I could tell this too.

The other night I had a nightmare about my mom, I can't remember exactly what happened but I remember feeling like shit that I don't talk to her. She's getting old and only one of my sister's speak to her. She was such a good mom before the divorce, she did everything for me. Even after when I broke my leg she stood with me every day and helped me rehabilitate. 

My life is so mangled and I'm not emotionally strong enough to get myself out of this rut. I know I need to talk to someone but I can't bring myself to do it."
3037,depression,Are individuals with depression vocal about it?,"I’m really sorry if this might a controversial topic:

Do people with depression usually vocalize and talking about it publicly? How can you tell someone that’s faking depression (or a narcissist) from someone that’s truly diagnosed with depression?"
3038,depression,The worst part is being so unbearably sad about nothing in particular,"At least when something tragic happens you can point to it. There's a logic to it. An acceptable mourning period. It can be terrible, but it does, slowly and steadily get better as you move away from that painful event. I've experienced this.
But then there are times when I wake up and my heart just sinks into my stomach and I feel this overwhelming sense of insignificance and it just doesn't stop no matter what I do. And the tears will come for no reason, other than a deep, unexplainable sadness that makes breathing hurt. I lose my appetite and can lay in bed for hours thinking of nothing, wanting nothing but to feel ""just ok"" again. Then I feel guilty because I shouldn't be sad, especially now. I'm healthy, I have a roof over my head and food to eat, I am so very fortunate, but I'm so tired of this."
3039,depression,A poem I wrote that is still so very relevant,"It’s July and it’s getting harder to find shade from all these questions and regressions,
It’s joy and magic and summertime Chi,
I wanna live and thrive but my actions imply that I wanna die. Actions speak louder than words but right now that’s false
I think I don’t sleep because my dreams consume my mind when I’m awake, increases my pulse . 
Not always the scary kind, there’s the light that penetrates through.
It’s about balance. 
I stand on two feet when I’m not laying in bed. 
Face sunk in the pillow tryna K.O. But the engine’s runnin in my head. 
It’s hard to live in a house that was your home but then the foundation crumbled and died. 
But I got visions of my aspirations, who I want to be, I’m tryna plant my seed, water my roots and expand my being. 
It’s all about balance. 
Take what you get give it your best. I think I’m doing better than before but what if I’m still stuck in the cycle?
 I got sunshine. 
I thought the rays would help me. it’s melted the frost in my chest but what if it hasn’t put to rest  the continuous thought. 
And I got love. It oozes from my pores, people sense it like snakes, always wanna taste either my skin or my words. 
And lately I haven’t been holding the pen or the sword. 
I been grasping the nicotine just gotta suck in more
tryna get buzzed or high talkin bout i don’t know why talkin bout I could stop if I tried and I could. 
But it’s nice to feel something. 
Can’t hold nobody’s hand right now so lemme go smoke on that tree. 
I just wanna be free. 
In my body I wanna be me. 
I got all these dreams. 
Tryna better myself and my family. 
 it’s hard when you’re not blind but you still can’t see"

3041,depression,being there.,I dont remember the last time someone has really been around to support me. I feel like when my friends are going through stuff i drop everything and  I help them out without them even asking. but i was showering today and i thought about people who have really helped me.. and i cant remember any. maybe its my fault for not opening up about my feelings.. but even on the rare occasions i do i just feel like such a burden... i only really ever feel like im a burden to people. Im honestly sick and tired of this...

For so many years I believed since I did not have visible scars that my pain wasn't real or I did not deserve to get treatment. I am sure there are many others out there with this same thought pattern. Stay safe everyone."

3047,depression,How I lost all of my friends in 2015,"I’m drunk and just confessed this story to my dad but he didn’t say anything in response which is wild bc I’ve been holding it inside for 5 years. 


I was sort of dating this guy and I was really scared to commit because he was my best friend. I was stupid and thought that because we only made out when I was drunk that meant he probably wasn’t actually into me, he was just drunk. Looking back he didn’t make out with anyone else so I was probably wrong. 



I would make out with anyone who was cute and wanted to at frat parties. I drank a lot and partied a lot because I liked to feel nothing but pleasure. Being sober wasn’t my favorite. He suggested I slow my roll, I brushed it off. 



One night I was assaulted under a basement staircase at a party in the same fashion Joe Biden’s accuser claims. Look it up if you want the details I don’t like to talk about it. 


I sat outside the party crying for like twenty minutes until my friend found me and called her boyfriend to take us back to the dorms. I told my RA about it and my sort-of-boyfriend sat and held my hand while I sobbed the story out. Didn’t report it because I don’t know who he was beyond that he wearing a striped t-shirt. 



When we left my RAs room my sort-of-boyfriend aka best friend told me he didn’t want to deal with me anymore because it was too hard to watch me not care about myself as much as he cared about me. He was more popular than me and had less mental issues so all of my friends including my roommate stopped hanging out with me in favor of him. 



I tried to join some clubs after that to make friends, fencing, chocolate club, a history club. Felt like shit for missing every other meeting so I just stopped attending. Transferred schools afterwards, was assaulted three more times in the last five years, each time I was drunk. Therapists either didn’t want to talk about it or blamed me because I was drunk. 



Finally I tried to kill myself and a sexual assault advocate came to my house and talked to me. Took me until then, four years later, to stop blaming myself. Now I have a new therapist and she’s the only one who has ever made any progress with me by identifying my horrible mental cycles stemming from my religious trauma growing up. 



Can’t talk to her because I’m in a different state during this quarantine and she can’t service people outside of her state. These last two months have been a lot of reliving those experiences. I feel like shit. I wish I could have some sort of closure with my ex-sort-of-boyfriend but I don’t think that five years later he’d want to remember I exist. I sure dont."

3052,depression,My cat my beautiful son," 

My cat my beautiful son 

he lived with me since he was 2 months old 

I cared about him, loved him with all my heart all my soul

I got a cat because I was depressed (still am but even more than before) 

I got him because i thought god could repay me for caring for such a pure soul and I wasn’t close to god not praying not doing anything

a couple of days before  i noticed that he couldn’t piss properly and losing appetite i knew 2 vets i called the first one who saved my cat before from poisoning i called him told him about my cat health he told me to bring him immediately to the clinic and because of corona lockdown the clinic was already shut in my city but the other clinic was open in another city but i couldn’t go the clinic in my city was open from 10 am to 8 pm but i didn’t get him to that clinic even though all the issues were within two days but i didn’t get him there even though that i hang with my friends around that time

the next day i called the second vet he told me to feed the cat yogurt and milk cheese because what my cat had appeared to be digestion issues i did feed him he responded but still no big appetite or almost no appetite at all i left him everything he needed hoping he could get better this option was cheaper for me 

next day i decided to get him a medicine then i got to the pharmacy got him a medicine called Motinorm then i got home i gave him a spoon of the medicine then i got out . got a call from my mother telling me that the cat is throwing up weird liquids white and more then i told my mother to leave him when i’ll get home i’ll get him to the vet that call was on 10 pm i got home late at 7 am next day I was with my friends then i got home found him sleeping still breathing i kissed him and then i got to sleep

on 5th of May 2020 my mother woke me up telling me to check on the cat he was on the ground his eyes were open and his mouth open and his body was stiff like wood i checked him no pulse no breath 

i moved my hand across all his body like i was playing with him like he was still alive then i kissed him for the last time 

i put his body into 2 pieces of cloths and covered him then i took him to bury him 

now he’s gone i feel i’m guilty i’m the one who chosed the cheap option the easy option 

i feel great pain and grief i was already dealing with depression and ptsd and his death came upon me and cut me deep 

i feel that i killed him even though i could save him i had the time the money but i didn’t save him i visited his grave many times since his death i feel i want to take home with me sleep with me in my arms 

i don’t know what to do i was holding a knife to my throat but i stopped 

i punched the wall hard as i could with my head and my hands 

i feel my misdeed my sin 

i can’t handle living without him remembering him waiting for me coming home and being all alongside me 

i have friends i have my family but i’m alone i stay in my room alone 

don’t know what to do 

should i kill myself, should i forget, don’t know."
3053,depression,I'm Mediocre,"Mediocre is the word that sums me up best. I have no special talents or skills. Every interest I've ever had that I put effort into has either resulted in me dropping it because I got bored of it, or even after years of effort trying to be good at it has failed. 

People always say that comparing yourself to others kills your happiness but I think that's just something they say to comfort people who are mediocre. 'Run your own race'. Enough of it. For once in my life I just want to be the best person I know at something. Yet even the things I've busted my balls to be good at I'm still not good at. And I'm sick of it. 

Everyone needs to be something. Being good at stuff is what gives life meaning. It's what makes a life matter, what they can do. Yet everything that I've tried, whether it be sport, music, writing, academics, or hell even chess, I've never been THE person people think of as the best person they know at it. 

I've been born a total loser. No drive. No ambition. No secret 'calling' that the special people get in life. I'm not even well liked by people. There would be some comfort in that at least. But no, I've always been the 'friend that's just there.' No ones best friend. Not 'the funny guy' of the group. If I had been given a sense of humour, and could make people laugh I'd take it. But no, I'm just the person who happened to find themselves as part of the group and no one really hates, but no ones especially likes either. Completely mediocre. And what do you do about that?

I cut out most of my friends recently because of that. Not that they have noticed. 

I'm not good looking either. Its shallow but it does matter for self esteem. Even that though. I'm not ugly, but I'm not 'turn your head' attractive either. Completely forgettable. I'm not smart. That's something else that could have made up for everything else. Make me smart, some person who has it all together, can problem solve without anxiety, can think critically and come up with ideas and solutions. But no, even there I don't have it. Even after actively trying to make myself smarter, I'm not smart. 

What's the end package then? Some loser with no friends, no ambition, no sense of humour, average looks, isn't smart, isn't skilled or talented at any of the things he tried to be good at. What's the fucking point in me being here? I shouldn't have been born."
3054,depression,I’m so depressed I haven’t taken out my contacts in 5 days,[removed]
3055,depression,I’m so tired of everything,"Has anyone ever wanted to just disappear or completely remove their existence? Like I don’t think I’d ever kill myself, but I wish I could just leave everything behind and start fresh. I’m saying that if I had a say, I wouldn’t have been born at all. Life kind of sucks the older you get, it seems to get worse sometimes because of the harsh reality of things that were never exposed to you as a kid. Like I feel like I’m just more and more disappointed and let down as time goes on. I also feel like all I do is just let others down somehow."
3056,depression,I’m so tired of everything.,"I don’t even know where to begin really. 

I guess I’ll start with I lost my mom last September, she raised me alone and the way she passed was traumatic. I watched her die during her liver transplant surgery and I felt so helpless and like I let her down. Since then I have had panic attacks and got diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder at an urgent care. Because of this I always feel like somthing is wrong with my body or an organ. 

I also lost about 60 pounds which isn’t a bad thing I was trying to (went from 380 to now 320) but I never felt worse. I constantly feel like somthing is wrong with me. My stomach and digestive system have been a wreck for about 2 months the urgent care just says it’s Gastritis but they also found a gallstone. So I feel like I lost the weight for nothing cause now I just feel like crap every time my stomach cramps up. On and off diarrhea, gas, my stomach gurgles. Unrelated but just to add onto how much my body hates me, i get cysts or boils all around my waste especially now in the summer that are painful when they flare up. 



I’m depressed all the time and my family knows and they care but they don’t know how to help. 
I don’t really know how to help myself either. 
I’m a 25 year old man and I feel like I’m worthless waste of space with a shitty body and mind. I can’t tell anyone just how much I miss my mom and hate myself for not being to help her I honestly hate life at this point. I’m just writing this all out cause I feel like I needed to put it down somewhere other then my head. 
I know there are people who have it a lot worse then me and I have no reason to complain which makes me hate myself more. I’m not suicidal cause I’m terrified of death but I do get the thoughts every once in awhile. 

Sorry for anyone who decides to read this. I know i am rambling on if none of this makes sense sorry to put you through that."

3059,depression,How can people be so motivated and happy,I have i blank look on my face most of the time I try to put on face that looks like I'm happy and fine. But alot of nights I cry silently so no one hears me. With this online school does not help because I'm really behind not because it's hard it's just I don't feel like doing anything I don't even want to move or talk. I've imagined alot of ways I would die most of them are suicide. I try to look for ways to get motivated but nothing works. And when I see people say stuff like don't kill yourself you have so much to live for I feal nothing it kinda makes it worse. I don't know what to do. I hate waking up so when I hear something that kinda sounds like my alarm clock is freak out a little it's like a jump scare. I have been motivated before but when I really start being productive it fades away.and I've already looked at the r/getmotivated. if you have any ideas to help please say something. And this is my first time posting
3060,depression,Just a vent I guess,"I have just realized that people don't care as much as they say they do, I always have to be the one to reach out to my friends to talk, they never reach out to me. My biological dad took every opportunity to skip out on important parts of my life, such as elementary school graduation, visits when I went in foster care, not quitting drinking when I begged him to. (His alcoholic rage fucked me up.) He even blamed some shit on me while he was in prison, so blast him to hell, still don't talk to him. 

My bake shop teacher was an asshole, made me feel uncomfortable in class, and made me rethink my dream job, everything was fine until the quarentine hit, was gonna move to hot foods, start dating, but nope, fuck you OP. Fuck you indeed OP. 

My adoptive dad always expresses some sort of minor disappointment when I play video games, the thing I wanted to do, versus reading, the thing my dad asks me to do because it is good for me. So what? I don't give two shits, I take people's orders all day at a McDonalds in quarentine, and unload a whole truck by myself cause some women at my joint don't believe in equal responsibility. I then have to close the store, cause I am too nice, and now I said yes to something that I probably should've said no to.

I don't expect any of you to care, this might not even get recognized, you probably are laughing at my problems, and that is fine. I will only just become more insecure as a result, thanks for reading Reddit, hope you fucking neckbeards enjoy this one."

3062,depression,Seeing her kills me.,"Since school has been canceled due to recent events, it's been much easier to forget about my ex. But I see pictures on social media and it pains me more than I can describe. My heart physically hurts, I feel hopeless. Although it was a decently long relationship, it's still been over six months and I can't see myself happy with another person.

 I just feel numb, I feel hopeless in humanity as a whole. Everyone simply cares for themselves, when all I wanted to do was give her everything despite what it would do to me."

3064,depression,cant connect with anyone,"i have been suffering for the past 7 years. Going through multiple episodes and pulling myself back up again. but my childhood trauma and issues always seem to follow me around no matter how hard i try to move on and embrace that and grow from it. it doesn’t seem to work. my mind always wanders back to the lack of emotional support i had as a child and the people who betrayed me. I cant trust anyone anymore and most importantly, i cant seem to make close friends. it feels like i cant connect with anyone at all if i try to talk and find similar interests. i cannot get close to anyone. i constantly think everyone will hurt me and i shut myself out. I have been trying to talk more, smile more and be interested in other people. i feel this need to get close to them but at the same time, i am always so formal and i cant interact with them the way people my age do (i am 20 years old). 
another things that constantly bothers me is wasting away my childhood and teen years because of depression. i missed out on so much and it pains me that i am still in that cycle and everyday i live with this, is just another day I wasting away. i hate waiting for the end. i want to be happy and i want to be successful. i want to see the world but all these dreams seem hard to reach not because of the hard work but sometimes the circumstances seem to just not be in my favor. 
I hate telling people my problems and my feelings. they get uncomfortable and say the wrong things when i tell them about my suicidal thoughts. i feel like a burden to them so i hate bothering people about it. I am writing all these here on reddit cause its comforting to know that someone is reading this and hearing me."
3065,depression,I’ve been depressed for years due to bullying. How do I overcome this? M(19),"When I started Highschool, I would never have imaged I’d come out of it depressed as shit and barely passing my classes. I remember it starting just before the 9th grade my friends would start to tease me. I didn’t care back then, it was stupid little jokes that really didn’t bother me. It wasn’t until midway through grade 9 that it got progressively worse. Everywhere I went, I was a source of ridicule and always the butt end of a joke from my group of friends. Still, it didn’t bother me much until the jokes would revolve my background and heritage. One instance I vividly remember I opened my locker to find pictures of my cousin, who had past away when he was 12. Then my friends surrounded me and made choking noises. Then everyone knew about it. Everyday I would hear jokes about my cousin and it pains me still to this day that they would ever make fun of a child who passed well before their time. I get that I might not be the most extroverted person out there, and I’m definitely a bit of a pushover. I just don’t like conflict and every time I stood up for myself they would just knock me down even harder. I’m still friends with some of the ex perpetrators, it’s way better now that some individuals are out of the picture and everything has pretty much stopped. But I can’t help but notice how much this has affected the way i view myself. I’ve been smoking weed a lot recently due to just not wanting to feel empty anymore but it’s honestly making it worse. I just want to be happy, I’m not expecting you guys to have all the answers, mostly just wanted to vent somewhere."

3067,depression,Life,"For a long time I wasn't sure if my sadness is depression. Even if the symptoms were present, I didn't admit it. I felt I needed a third party, specifically a therapist, to diagnose me.

Writing this post is me admitting that I have depression without a third party.

This doesn't mean I am fixing myself and working towards healing. Not really. I don't know.

I'm just tired of life. I want someone to end my life or magically fix me entirely.

&amp;#x200B;

For the most part, I like being and doing things alone since I don't have a significant other. (I rather spend time and be with my special someone.) But I have realized I am starting to get lonely and admit that I am lonely. I yearn for this special someone. I want to talk to them and be intimate with them."
3068,depression,This is the only reddit group I get notifications for. THE ONLY ONE!,Reddit is making me depressed.
3069,depression,I’m probably going to break up with my boyfriend soon. I wish I could have more self confidence but the world seems to think I don’t deserve it. I can’t stand it anymore.,"Im F19.
My ex was a cheating scumbag. He always compared me to other women he messed with and I was too afraid to leave because he always threatened suicide. 

My now boyfriend has a thing for blondes (I’m brunette/black hair). He’s asked me multiple times if I could wear a blonde wig and he told me a few weeks ago he had a dream about a blonde girl sucking him off. I’m probably going to break it off tomorrow, because I can’t keep going in this relationship when I know he has feelings like this. 

My confidence is dogshit already. I have absolutely no self worth and generally am just very nasty to myself. I’ve been abandoned by all my family, I have no friends to turn to, and all I want to do is end it. The irrational thoughts and depressive episodes have gotten so bad with jealousy that anytime I see a moderately attractive girl I want to cry and breakdown. 

I will never be as pretty or be as worth as them. Why do they always have to have the nice lives and friends? I buy thousands of dollars worth of clothes and products to make myself look better and NOTHING works, but they just smile and wave and get tons of friends. The only reason I had two boyfriends in the first place is because I knew them beforehand when we were kids, but if I broke up with my boyfriend I highly doubt any guy who values his social standing would even look at me, let alone ask me out or anything. Even though I’m 19, I don’t want to “let loose” and party and do all that shit. I just want a quiet normal life but I feel when everyone is done with that phase in their life, it’ll be in our late 20’s and by then it’s hard to start a family or whatnot, considering it takes years to get to know someone enough to want to marry them. 

Im going to fucking die alone, I swear to god. This always fucking happens. Something good happens and it turns out to be too good to be true."
3070,depression,im hurting so bad,"idk what to do anymore. it feels like nobody cares about me anymore. i can’t stop crying, i cry all fucking day and i hate it. sometimes i don’t even realize right away that i’m crying. i don’t know how to get better anymore. everything is so meaningless now, nobody wants me anymore. i tried so hard to be good and a good friend and a good person and i’d like to believe i was. i don’t want to die yet, even though i can’t stop thinking about killing myself, i just want to sleep forever or at least a very long time. but right now i have a tiny cat calico critter and i’ve named him Truffle, and he makes me feel better because i feel like he doesn’t feel burdened by me telling him about my problems. i can’t do anything right anymore, everything i create it hideous, everything i say is ugly, everything i do is wrong. i’m trying very hard to still seem happy, but i can’t do that right either. my heart aches very bad, my whole body does. i haven’t felt this sad in a year. i hope this passes soon."
3071,depression,I’m (23F) embarrassed and ashamed to share my feelings with my partner (27M) because I don’t want him to feel like I play victim.,"For starters, I apologize for the rambling and unorganized aspect of this post but I’m just in the thick of it. There’s no way for me to genuinely paint the whole picture with all the details, but I did my best. I read a lot on this sub to try to find clarity for myself and I’m hoping to be able to lean on this community—craziness and all. If anything it was a good opportunity to vent. 

I’ve been feeling ashamed of my depression and I’m having a hard time sharing my emotions with my partner of just over a year. For about two years, I’ve been professionally diagnosed and treated by a psychologist for major depressive and anxiety disorder. That being said, now that I understand my mental illness, it’s something I’ve battled for years prior. 

This means I have frequent highs and lows, overall lack of motivation, extreme fatigue, I cry a lot, and an ever-changing sex drive. All of which cause a great deal of friction in my relationship (especially the sex thing). 

I have always been the type to be transparent about my feelings to help the people around me understand what I’m going through. Lately, however, I’ve been feeling like my openness about my low emotions has been causing more damage. 

It’s happened before, but this week in particular, I’ve felt like my partner has been dedicating a lot of time to his routine. He still is working full time from home while I’m on minimal work-from-home (video meetings and online training for about 6-8 hours a week). I have tried to create a routine for myself and even cut out cannabis in an attempt to stay productive and motivated during the stay-at-home order. Unfortunately, the highs and lows of my depression seem to be more intense. I can’t keep myself busy and I’m constantly comparing my productivity to that of my partner. 

Ultimately, I think I get super insecure because he seems to be so on top of his responsibilities and self-motivated. As a result, I will get sad and cry about not feeling like we are living our lives together or spending enough time together. If I really analyze our interactions, we do make time to have meals together, he brings me coffee in the mornings, we are very open and verbal about our affection for one another. 

I start to get in the headspace of feeling like my emotions aren’t justified and I’m just being insecure. Why should I feel this way if I can think of all the good things from our relationship? I just haven’t been taking criticism well and have been feeling extra needy. It seems like my partner is having a hard time continuing to comfort me. 

Specifically, today (and the last couple days, but today was by far the worst) I had been feeling light headed and faint all day—like abnormally exhausted. I got through my day of meetings and side projects, made all of our meals, ran errands... by the end of the day I was just totally wiped. My arms and legs were starting to feel tingly and I just had to go to sleep. Obviously this whole day I’ve been expressing how I’m not feeling right and my partner would ask what he could do to help. 

After my most recent breakdown about not feeling like we get quality time together, he even took a day off from his side project to spend the evening with me. I was so grateful, but I just felt so sick and fell asleep. When I woke up I was still feeling bad and he reluctantly came into the room and asked what’s wrong and then made a comment (jokingly from his perspective) that there’s always some ailment with me and I’m his broken girl. I was immediately filled with undeniable guilt. The last thing I want is to be broken or be the girl who always has some issue and needs saving. 

I just don’t know what to do because my feelings are real and I know I have a mental illness—I want to be able to be open and recognize my feelings with my partner, but I also worry it’s causing more issues."
3072,depression,Cutting a friend out who is nothing but supportive,"My best friend of six years has been nothing but supportive and encouraging with my struggles yet I still cut him out of my life. He's the only one who has ever known how truly bad it can get and has been there for me, yet I hate that he wants me to be happy and successful. I don't know if it's that because he's the only person to know this much, if it's because I'm more comfortable hating myself than being positive, if it's jealousy and spite and trust issues, or probably all of the above and then some.

All I know is that when I'm with him I don't hate him, but as soon as I'm away and alone I suddenly despise him. Like my mind completely warps who he is into someone I detest. I'm afraid that if I try to reconnect he'll either refuse for his own health, or that I'll inevitably cut him out again like an asshole, and this makes me afraid that I'll treat everybody who gets close like this. I can be remorseful and positive now, but when I begin slipping again any logic will go out the window and I'll revert to anger and isolation."

When its staring me in the face almost screaming ""over dose on me!"" its so hard not too. But I thought about the few real reasons I have to fight. In a way I feel like I've matured talking to my girlfriend when she's depressed. I've started thinking about the reasons for me to fight. And it helps so fucking much. I realized I do have reasons for myself and not just to make other people happy. In a way I started thinking about myself a bit more. Id recommend it."
3075,depression,Depressing thought,"No one would be perfectly correct in either side of the coin. Laws are there for a reason. If the law states this or the procedure states this and that then do what is due. Problem is laws can be repealed. Why pass through time arguing over Laws that can change, can be repealed, made by a group of a few, supposedly to be followed by all. Justice in this world is impossible - we can't agree on anything as a Human Race. Empires fall and along with it laws change, to favor its present slaves, to dull the pain. This justice served differently across different epochs, same thing - people felt justified, some not. Laws would favor you today, come a different time it won't. Laws change, feelings of justice change, people die anyway, worse is that the version of justice when they lived didn't favor their cause. Imaginary almost, we make vivid dreams of perfection and order and it will stay that way, a dream while being awake. Humanity's Justice is based on Luck and Chance - Real Justice is straightforward and true and that is when death comes, we all face the same fate. When we are all silent of how we killed ourselves slowly instead of actually living. Maybe it is the dead who mourns for the living. A depressing thought it is."
3076,depression,How am i supposed to keep going if i can't get help and can't get any better?,"My exams are coming up, i feel like i'm not prepared at all, my mental health is fucked, my physical one is also not great, and i can't get help because of how boomers my parents are, also i can't improve myself because for example i cannot change my environment, i'm trapped into having to study when i wish i could give attention to more parts of my life. i'm writing this in the middle of a online class because i cant go on like this. i cant man.

This is like the 100th post i write desperately here on reddit and nothing has changed, why even try anymore (dont think that i didnt try in real life)

i dont like this world at all i prefer sleeping"
3077,depression,"Why the fuck I have just two model? Suicidal Vs there is nothing better than this life, sulking Vs feeling like dancing and hugging everyone. I wish to be ok being normal, but I just can't in the middleway :'(",
3078,depression,I feel too far gone for anyone to care. Depression has made me horribly boring.,"I don't really seek out help because I feel bad for oversharing, so I'm not trying to blame people for not noticing or anything, but I just feel like I'm not worth the effort of trying to help. 

I've been depressed for so long that instead of ""nothing that used to be important seems fun anymore"", which is a warning sign, has turned into ""no interests, hobbies, or discernible personality"". I've become boring because depression has spent years hollowing me out from the inside. Why would anyone want to help someone who doesn't have anything to offer to the world by recovering. 

I'm not crying out for help or fighting to get better, I'm not trying to throw a pity party, I just hate how I'm not a person anymore. How I'm scared to talk to new people, not because I'm horribly socially awkward or anything, but because I know I have nothing to offer. It takes one simple question about what I do for fun or what I like for me to inevitably draw a blank and for someone to immediately lose interest. I just want things to be fun again. Even the stuff I enjoy never seems worth the effort. I'm sleeping 12 hours a day just to pass the time and hopefully fast forward until things get better, but I know they won't. I'm not suicidal but I feel like I'm complicit in wasting my life, which might as well be the same thing to me. 

I feel so detached from basic human interaction. Friendships and a life outside of the bare minimum is so distant to me it feels like something that only happens in movies at this point. I even feel bad typing this all out because I feel dramatic, but I just wish I was worth someone's time or effort. I wish I could be someone's friend, and someone could enjoy being mine. I want something to offer. I'm exhausted."
3079,depression,Ever feel like you’re just an old shell of the person you used to be?,"Stuck between hanging on to my old self and just accepting I’m not that anymore I don’t even recognize myself anymore.  I’m stuck between fighting another day and just giving up. I feel so alone but don’t like being around anyone. I have no desire to make an effort in seeing anyone or contacting friends/ family. I’m just existing these days hoping one day a switch will flip. Everyday this dark hole I’m in gets a little deeper. And I hate talking about my problems cause I feel misunderstood or written off , for some reason I want my problems to really resonate with anyone I explain them to (maybe so I don’t feel all alone?) idk if I’ll ever genuinely feel happy again. Sorry I just needed to rant 😞"
3080,depression,I felt peace with being dead for a brief moment,"I wanna preface this with saying that at the same time I feel scared of death and a little scared of living. Tonight I cut myself and I went through the same shit by listening to sad music, overthinking, and wallowing in my misery. But once I threw myself onto my bed, stared at the ceiling and spaced out, I felt ok with being completely dead for a moment. Idk how to describe because it was really weird but I’ll do my best if you understand. But I was laying on my bed staring at the ceiling and everybody dies in their nightmares started playing. Once the song came on I started shivering a lot while listening to it, completely motionless, and once it stopped, I stopped shivering, spaced out, and just felt lifeless for a little bit with a sharp pain in my heart, wishing that it could end tonight, and it felt kinda good for a bit. That’s the best I could describe my experience tonight and maybe someone else has felt something similar?"
3081,depression,I have felt lost for five years with no goals and no dreams...,"I have felt lost for five years, no matter how happy or sad I am...

For the past five years I’ve battled with depression. Early on I felt it the worst, I had thoughts of suicide and I separated myself from everyone who I loved and cared about. Over the years, I began to slowly understand my depression, but still succumb to it. I would have happy days/weeks/months, but at the end of the day I would still be alone with my thoughts at night, and it would all come back to me.

I finally saw a therapist, but it didn’t help very much, even though I really tried to give it my best effort. I believe one day I will try therapy again, but I don’t feel like trying again so soon after it didn’t work out. 

Recently, even with corona going on, I’ve been in a limbo, and after reading through some posts, I can tell I’m not alone. As people are stuck inside with their own thoughts, it can be hard, even though your daily stresses aren’t as high.

My problem is that I have been trying to control my thoughts and work on my mental health during this time, but I feel lost in my life. I am on a career path that was chosen for me by my parents. They paid for me to go to college and get a great degree at a respected university, but I don’t feel like I’m on the right path. I enjoy what I’m studying in school, but I don’t think it’s what I want to do for the rest of my life, and at this point I typically hear two things, either “you only have one life, do what makes you happy” or “take a semester/year off and decide what you want to do” and both of these don’t work for me.

I don’t know what makes me happy. I’ve spent every night for the past five years trying to focus on the things that make me happy and often times it just comes down to the people closest to me. I don’t seem to have any passions or goals or even really hobbies. Thus, I don’t really have any careers that excite me, unlike some of my friends who have had dreams of jobs they’ve wanted to do since they were a kid.

I guess I ask you, if you are still reading, what would you do if you were me? If you had no goals or dreams in life, but you were on a path you didn’t necessarily want to be on? 

I can’t leave the path because that would require choosing another path, and I don’t know which path I would even pick. However I can’t stay on the path I’m on because that’s a life wasted.

Thank you if you read this far, this is my first time posting about my mental health publicly on the internet."
