1,cscareerquestions,Career advice transitioning into tech,"I’m interested in moving into tech and have a background in graphic design, marketing and website design, and some basic level of coding experience in HTML, CSS and MJML. So far I’m leaning towards studying UX/UI design but would love any suggestions of fields that would be good to move into that might still be able to incorporate some level of creativity.

I’m wondering how hard it is to break into the industry, and whether doing something like a course in UX/UI as opposed to something like a computer science degree would be sufficient enough to land work once complete? Would love to hear any feedback or suggestions!"
2,cscareerquestions,Need honest reality check: should a 4th year premed switch to tech/software engineering?,"Hello all

I am a current 4th year undergrad with a science major at a decent state school who applied to med schools this cycle and is still waiting to hear back. In the meantime, I've been taking some CS and finance classes and I've been having second thoughts in a career as a physician for the following reasons: 

I've heard so many horror stories about med school and residency by this point

I realized how much you can make in FAANG and similar companies nowadays. I also realized that med school is a pretty bad financial investment. Accounting for all the debt and the years before of any real salary, I wouldn't catch up to my CS friends in total career earnings until my 40s if ever

The work life balance in tech is way better and in general I feel like medicine is a very conformist profession - you're supposed to put up with all the horrible stuff and you expect to be treated like shit

At the same time, I killed the MCAT so I'm fairly confident in my chances of getting into at least 1 med school this cycle and performing well there

In my honest opinion, I messed up by choosing med when I was 17 but I'm trying to figure out which path is better for me at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons to stick with medicine 

I would most likely need additional schooling (postbacc/master's/bootcamp) and grind significantly for a year or two to get a deeper background to get taken seriously in the job market nowadays, whereas I already grinded for 3 years for med and I'm hopefully set to go to med school next year

Potentially more meaningful work: I've seen many SWEs complaining that they don't get any satisfaction from their work whereas in medicine I'm at least helping people no matter what

Based on my academic performance in premed, I know I'll at least be a decent med student whereas there's no guarantee I'll be a good SWE

The barriers to entry in medicine and the nature of work make it one of the most stable high-paying professions whereas in tech you could get laid off.

&amp;#x200B;

Reasons to switch to tech

Better WLB in tech, especially in my 20s

The ability to make doctor salaries without all that schooling plus I could start making money in my 20s and invest it for compounding interest whereas I would make less than the minimum wage as a resident and get treated like crap while having being chained to 200K+ debt

Sure you make a lot as a doctor later in life but what would you do with all that money in your 40s and 50s when the time to enjoy it is in your 20s and 30s when you're still young

Way more flexibility in work as a SWE. You can work for big tech, the government, fintech, biotech, startups etc. Every industry needs a SWE nowadays.

Learning A&amp;DS and doing leetcode problems is pretty interesting to me (but I'm not sure how that would translate into interest in the actual job).

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my plan for the next few months is to take more CS courses through my university and online platforms, grind leetcode, and learn python while also prepping for med school interviews to keep my options available as I gain more coding experience. 

Thank you and what do y'all think?"

4,cscareerquestions,My experience is all over the place. How do I calculate years of experience?,"I have been coding on-and-off since 2015. In that time, I have also completed a 1 year full time certificate in software development, and also a degree in digital design.

I have experience with several programming languages and frameworks, but the majority of my experience is in front end web dev. I am not proficient enough in any of the frontend frameworks to land a job, but I am currently focusing on learning React with the view of being hireable in 6 months time as a junior frontend developer.

I have worked on a software startup project since 2018, which I recently decided to shelve earlier this year due to being unable to secure funding for it. The scope of this project was large, and I ended up putting 1000s of hours of work into it over the last 4 years. From the business side, to the design side, to the development side (I did some of the coding myself with some outside help also). I managed to get the product to tech demo stage, which is something I am proud of despite the circumstances involved which included zero financing, and a former co-founder who was supposed to be responsible for everything non-tech (business, pitching, networking, etc) who literally didn't lift a finger the entire time, leaving me to do all of it. I managed to rid myself of him around a year ago, and attempted to continue the project myself but it ended up being too much to handle. Nevertheless, I do not regret working on the project, and I learned a lot while working on it - albeit in varying fields both tech and non-tech.

Right now, I feel that I'm very much a jack-of-all-trades in pretty much everything. But I do see frontend web dev as the most straightforward path. I recently started a 6 month internship at a business consultancy agency, where I will be responsible for their digitalisation strategy, project management, and some light web dev. I am learning React in my spare time.

I feel that I am missing that 1 ""killer portfolio project"" - which is something I plan to address once I am comfortable enough with React to start it. My startup project is listed on my portfolio, but obviously it was never finished, and the scope of it is simply too big to attempt to finish myself, at least in the foreseeable future. Therefore, I am going to build something much more straightforward as a portfolio project instead.

Anyway, my question to the community is - Given that my experience is so varied in so many areas, how many years of experience should I put on my resume?"

34,cscareerquestions,Is my computer science degree a waste ?,"So I graduated in 2020 with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering from the highest ranking university on my continent. But I feel like it’s been a waste.
It took me 5 years to do a 3 year degree because I changed majors 2 years into my degree (astrophysics &amp; maths -&gt; cs &amp; ceng ). 
Now that I have some work experience, most of the people I work with don’t even have a degree or went to university. They’re either career switchers, self-taught, went to some small college (diploma not even bachelors degree level) or bootcamp. 
Why did I study a degree and get a job, that I don’t even need a degree for? It’s not like you can get ‘self-taught surgeons’ or something.
I’ve been feeling quite down about having wasted time studying really difficult subjects like maths, physics, electrical engineering, embedded systems etc. just to land a job as a frontend engineer, something that someone who did 6 months of bootcamp can do…and also much younger than me. I mean, our frontend tech lead is my age with 5 yoe…
Also most of the people I worked with, only worked at this company, for like 5+ years, some even 9 years at this company. 
Does anyone relate to this? Did I really waste my time studying a computer science degree ?"

38,cscareerquestions,Finishing degree vs job offer,"I know this is a more subjective question, but am hoping for some long term benefit or pro vs con advice form experienced folks.

Background, I am 34 and have returned to University to complete a B.S. degree I ran out of money for in the past. I am planning to graduate in Fall 2023 do to the course schedule, but realistically have \~ 15 credits left for my Psychology and CS degree and am doing a career shift.

Currently working in a stable position at the University as a research assistant in a lab I rather like. The work isn't always the most interesting, but it is a flexible environment with a good team and it makes my schooling free \~$3000 a semester. Pay is $18 hourly and I get to work with some neat tech, but don't really get to play too deeply with anything.

Was reached out to by a recruiter for a government lab position as ""Junior Linux and Windows Desktop Support Technician"" with data analysis and configuring niche tech I'm familiar with, though it seems to want more focus on bash and Linux with a familiarity with coding languages. Pay is minimum $22.50 though I plan to counter for $25 hourly. It would also get me a clearance and better retirement and medical.

The government position will either delay or halt my degree though. 

Is the experience worth stalling my education? Can the experience replace my degree or become more valuable in the long term? 

I was planning on pursuing DevOps. Please let me know if any more details are needed or more important that I haven't been thinking about."

40,cscareerquestions,I was offered both an internship opportunity in the IT department and a research assistantship in the CS department. Which one should I choose? (Or neither?),"I'm a junior CS major and work at the IT help desk for my university but I was offered an internship opportunity in the department since my supervisor hooked me up with someone else. 

He had told me that the internship would consist mostly of me helping with automating a lot of their processes through coding. It sounded like a cool opportunity. I would make the same amount of money as I would working at the help desk (one more dollar than minimum wage), but I'd get an extra stipend of 3500 along with free food and housing for the summer. 

 I was then offered a research experience over the summer with a professor. I would work on a very big research project with him and one other student, in the area of machine learning. I would only get the extra stipend and free housing/food but I won't lie, machine learning has always been a very interesting subfield to me. 

Would this be worth going with? I've applied to several places but I'm not a super competitive applicant. I go to a lesser-known school, have around a 3.0 GPA, don't have finished side projects, and only have the IT help desk as work experience so I don't want to bet on something bigger if it'd be better to play it safe for now until I have more experience.

I have 15 years of experience in distributed systems. I used to be the technical lead for the backend infra of some data service at a big N company. Oversaw and mentored 6 engineers (full team was \~40 engineers overall), drove the technical direction and all planning. I became disillusioned with the company and moved a year ago to my current team at a different big N company,

It's been rough from the start. I was hired with the promise of being a lead and working on new technology I'm interested in, but this vanished after I joined. The project ended up going to someone else, and I'm now stuck doing trivial work I could have done 10 years ago on a project that is nothing like what I was hired for. Worse, the project is making slow progress because I'm working on it alone. 

I've talked to my manager several times about this frustration, each time they assure me that my project is essential and that there's a path back to being a team lead if I just keep at this. They keep promising head count, but I just heard last week that it's going to be given to other projects.

My manager just asked if I wanted to replace the current production tech lead who is leaving the team. He owned production health which includes oncall, releases, alerts, testing, etc. and he led a small team of 2-3 engineers.

I am not excited by this offer. I had this role on my last team as part of being the backend tech lead and I joined my current team because I was hoping to do something new.

However, I'm so bored with what I'm doing now and I don't see any other prospects for leadership on this team. I know I could do a good job at this role and help my team. And at least I'd be helping to guide other engineers which I've missed a lot.

I could leave my team, but it's only been a year and I'm hesitant to change again. I'm looking at starting a family soon and it's just really not a good look to come into a new team and immediately take time off.

I'm also thinking of asking to join the original project I was expecting to lead. I'd be doing work at a few steps below my level, but I'm already doing that now. At least this way I'd be working on something I was interested in.

Thoughts on what the right move is? I need to give an answer to my manager in 2 days."

How trivial is it, assuming that you’ve never seen the problem before, to write an algorithm which sets all of the next pointers so that they form a level-order, top down, left to right, traversal of the tree, regardless of its structure, which runs in linear time.

65,cscareerquestions,Thinking about dental school as a sophomore with a computer science major,"Hi guys,

So I am now a sophomore as a computer science major, and I am starting to think that maybe I should go to dental school. This was one of my hardest decisions before starting college because I love everything that has to do with healthcare, but I also love math and I am also really good at it. I decided to go for computer science major mainly because of the debt that I had to take to go to dental school, especially because my family would not be able to support financially at all, and also because I thought this would be the best major as a math lover.

However, now as a sophomore I as starting to think that maybe I should had gone for dental school. The problem is not that I hate programming, I really like it, but I hate this major(if it even makes sense). I feel like I have to take so many useless classes with professors who do nothing. I am currently taking discrete math and this class is not only the first math class that I hate, but it is also making me think that I hate math as a whole(not because it is hard, but because it feels so meaningless, boring, and unorganized, maybe because of my professor). Data structures in the other hand feels as the most boring class ever, maybe because I taught myself this class before so I could start to do LeetCode and now I have to listen to the same thing again.

In the other hand, I feel like that this major is hurting my social skills. I am somewhat introverted as a person, but I feel necessary to be around people, even if I am not necessarily talking to them. I feel like this major is making me spend so much time alone and I am really feeling the effects of this. In addition, I have also started to be a lot less active that before. As a dentist I think that I will be able to have a lot more social contact as a software engineer and I will also be able to be a lot more active because I would not work sitting on a chair all the time. 

I am not sure if it’s the major that I don’t like or the professors that I have this semester. And to be honest I also do not want to leave this major. I am not sure if I will be able to go to dental school for financial reasons I do not want to end up only with a biology degree. What do you all think? Should I switch major? Or should I try pre-dental and keep the CS major? Is this even possible and has anyone done this?

I am not sure if this is the right subreddit, but I really need others opinion."

71,cscareerquestions,Are there any resources to help understand accents?,"In CS, I find that probably 50+% of the people I work with and interact with at work and on job interviews have Indian or Asian accents (usually Indian accents) that can be extremely difficult to understand, especially over the phone or on Teams meetings where cameras are off (and I prefer camera-off meetings, but it does pose a problem). On Teams meetings, I've started turning on subtitles, and Microsoft actually does a really good job of doing live captions on even heavily accented speech. But over the phone, it's a different issue.

I can't ask EVERY person I encounter every single day to slow down and speak more clearly; that will get annoying. So clearly, I need to work on growing my OWN understanding. Are there any resources to help me better understand heavily accented speech? I want to be able to better communicate with coworkers &amp; recruiters in my career."
72,cscareerquestions,"Experienced engineers, in the long run is better to be a specialized field or a generalist field?","For some context, my background is Computer Engineering.

But in my current position, when looking for other companies doing the same thing, I've realized there are very few - with the exception of our main competitor. 

As part of testing data storage code, I've gotten the chance to lean about data engineering/data visualization which I've noticed there seems to be a lot of demand and open positions for. Alternatively a lot of high paying financial platforms desire low-level coders for other projects. 

Does it make more sense to specialize on what I already know, or to become more generalized so I can hop to these other companies."

76,cscareerquestions,Having trouble deciding between CIS and CS for school. Need advice.,"So I was a premed major who took a year off from school and then realized that I didnt wanna go that route anymore and wanted to switch to IT instead. The problem is my school only has two options: Computer Science or Computer Information Systems. I have 0 experience with programming or coding and was thinking about choosing CIS since I heard it's much easier than computer science and is less time consuming. However, after looking at the classes my school offers for CS, I feel like I would have interest in the math classes. I enjoy algebra a lot and like math in general but since I have no experience with programming or coding I feel like it would be too daunting for me?  So for Computer Science I think I would like the classes but im worried I wouldnt do well and would struggle heavily in the programming classes. Also for some reason for my school it says that the Computer Information Systems major is in the Business school and that I would also have to automatically minor in business administration. I honestly dont like the sound of minoring in business administration though because I dont think I have much/any interest in that field. What would be the better option for me?

82,cscareerquestions,One month into my new job and the anxiety is overwhelming.,"I'm a consultant working on-site for a very large financial firm as a Software Developer. My entire team is remote except me and my manager. My manager does not like me at all, is extremely bad at communicating and gets annoyed when I ask her to elaborate. I was assigned a mentor who over time has grown very aloof and distant with me. I have no friends here in this new city, I see no way to make friends here (as my entire team is remote). I work with weird internal tooling that has barely any documentation. I feel completely isolated directly working with people I KNOW who dislike me.

I am the only consultant on this team. I shared the output of some code I wrote and my manager immediately jumped down my throat and criticized it. It turned out that my output was actually correct, so it just felt like she was so eager to find some reason to rail on me. 

I don't know what to do. It was so hard to get this job and now all I do is ruminate about it. I'm thrown into a sink-or-swim environment where it feels like the ones in charge of me want me to drown. All I can think about everyday is how I need to get out. All I do on my spare time is LeetCode. I don't how I'm going to get out with only one month into this job. I can't even sleep because of how anxious I am to go into work tomorrow. And don't say it's Imposter Syndrome. I am very confident in my abilities: the anxiety is coming from having no one except two people (manager and mentor) who are NOT supporting me whatsoever. Do I just survive for 6 months? I just don't know what to do my life is a mess. This is not how I saw it panning out."

It’s due Monday and I had it finished last Thursday but when I merged my code I found out that they completely changed how our data flows(I’m not sure if I’m explaining this part correctly but it’s the way it hits each layer of our back end to the database). So now most of what I worked on has broken and I’m just worried because I had a meeting with my boss and he even brought up how it was taking me a while, he said he understood because I’m new but I feel so set back because it’s due tomorrow and two of my parts to my feature are broken still. I know this is part of the job and I truly don’t mind fixing issues but I am finding it really difficult to love the backend. I originally wanted to be a front end dev but took this job because it was offered to me right out of school. I want to find another job but I’m not having much luck and I’m honestly just worried.

I'm also coming from a bank where business casual was required and I did not like it at first, but it eventually it grew on me.

112,cscareerquestions,Advice for a Software Engineering student,So I was just reading a post on here about how small the percentage is of people that actually make it in the industry and (even though the OP said not to) it got me a little discouraged…so I was just wondering what steps or projects I should take on outside of school to increase my chances of getting my foot in the door after I graduate?
113,cscareerquestions,Should I quit my job or continue?,"So I'm a junior developer in europe of 6 months. This is my very first developer job. I didn't do any internships during college. 
I really like my company. My boss is very chill and friendly. No stress, no one constantly watching over your shoulder, lots of freedom and worker benefits and fun company events. However lately problems have been pilling up and I need to let some gas out:

I started to feel very alienated and unwelcomed in my team. Mainly because of my mentor. From the beginning on, my mentor was never interested in helping me. I would always get the feeling like I'm a nuisance for him. He has lots of mood swings. He would frequently start cursing and being mad because someone somewhere changed some API and now nothing works. There is no chance I can even mention his name in those moments. 
When he does actually help, he just makes it so that my program compiles without explaining me a single word of what he just did. The only words he would say is ""done, here now it works"". Like thanks, but I have no idea what you just did. 
Problems continue. He would give me something to implement and then he implements it himself without telling me anything and I end up doing useless work. Whenever he does a pull request I'm the only one from the team who he doesn't include in code reviews. 
But I still take a look at his code anyways. If I have something to comment on his pull request he would just ignore it completely and merge it anyway. 
Once I realized there was a memory leak in his code and that it could cause a problem in the future. He of course still ignored the comment and merged anyways. At that moment I didn't keep sielent but against my imposter syndrome forced a discussion with him about the memory leak. At first he didnt believe me. But then after I sent him multiple internet links and stack overflow questions as proof he just dismissed it with ""we need to do some work buddy""..

So pretty quickly I started to just not care and solve my problems myself so that I dont have to deal with him. This has obviously costed some time than if someone would just explain me what's wrong.

On top of all of this there is another layer to it. I started this job together with someone else from my same college. He is an absolute workaholic and software development is pretty much his whole life. He only ever talks about work, and sits in front of his screen with absolute 100% focus for 8h straight. I don't understand how can someone be so focused at coding the entire day. 
We come from the same background, same work time, yet he is miles ahead of me and already the left hand of our team lead with over 10 years of experience. I cant help it but constantly compare myself with him and feel anxious about it...

Anyways, my friends are telling me I should just look for a new place or at least switch teams. 

However I'm not sure about it. This ""pain"" that I experience has been the biggest motivation to improve myself that I ever had. I come home from work, and hustle the remaining day to improve my overall developer skills like I never did before. I want my mentor and my team to take me seriously. No, I dont just want my mentor to take me seriously, I want to be BETTER than him. I want to be more valuable than him. I dont want to feel anxious about my performance and feel valuable for our team lead. 
I've neglected my hobbies, social life and girlfriend in  order to improve myself as a developer. It feels damn good when I feel like I made some progress. Because I know I'm one step closer to achieving those goals. I've learned more in those 6 months through hustling than I did in my whole life. This is why I'm reluctant to report my situation to the boss. 

So.. do you think I should let the pain continue pushing me further, tell everything to my boss, or is this going to eat me up eventually one day if I don't quit? 
Thank you for your time and reading."

116,cscareerquestions,Junior Software Engineer in language i'm not familiar with,"I am currently applying for jobs and a recruiter reached out to me about a position for a C# Software Engineer 2 position. I am currently in an internship for a jr. java developer and most of my education has been focused on Java (Graduated in December 2021). I just got done the interview and they said they were very impressed (basic OOP questions, what is an object... etc) no coding assessment. Very basic stuff they then went to said that the software development team is also responsible for DevOps. I was just curious if this is normal?

Also is it normal to be offered Software Engineer 2 positions before Software Engineer 1 positions?  They stated that Software Engineer 1 positions are for entry level while 2 is more junior level. This is a contract to hire position for about 3-6 months and I would be learning most of the time which I would need since basically all the technologies in their tech stack I am unfamiliar with (C#, .NET, Kubernetes, Azure, Vue JS, Octopus, team city, etc..). They would want me to learn all of these. I have the basics down for C# since it is similar to Java but I am not confident in my C# skills. It sounded like they would give me an offer early next week and im not sure if I would be a good fit or If I should continue to look for a Java Developer position which I am more confident in.

120,cscareerquestions,Advice on rejection feedback for Tech Lead role,"I just received my interview feedback (rejected) after getting to the final round for a tech lead role in a startup.

I would like to understand the feedback better and see how I can improve.

The role was for a tech lead (so not a management/people leading role). The feedback says I did great on the technical side, but was not a good fit on the leadership side, because I was not aware of best practices.

I don't understand, what are these leadership best practices and where can I learn more?

Did they mean leadership in terms of leading people/teams, or something else? Because from what I gather, I passed the technical side, but then I failed at leading because I was not aware of best practices for leadership.

**Some things I mentioned or answered in regards to leadership during the interview:**

\- Allow flexibility in the workflow of individual teams depending on the specific team needs.

\- Don't change the workflow or add additional processes to a high-performing team, even if most other teams follow the process.

\- Don't micromanage people. Try to enquire and learn about blockers or reasons for low-performing teams and team members.

\- If metrics are needed, keep them on the team level and not on the individual level

\- Be empathetic and assign tasks based on an individual's weakness/strength

\- Keep different teams in sync by having a weekly or bi-weekly meeting - try to keep the meeting ad-hoc in case it needs to be skipped. I didn't say anything additional about keeping teams in sync."

123,cscareerquestions,Questions as an CS 2 Year Grad,"Hello, everyone! Long time lurker, first time poster. I've tried to read the wiki for lots of these questions, but I'm still a bit lost. Forgive me if I'm asking anything you hear 1000 times a day.

Context: I am graduating this fall with my **AS in CS** from a community college in central VA. Only random GE requirements left, CS sequence done. I **have already taken architecture/organization and data structures/algorithms. I do not intend to transfer to a 4yr school** as it's just not financially viable for me at this time. **I am not asking whether I should go to a 4yr or not.** No internships/professional SE experience so far, mistake noted. :(

What this means (to me) is that I'm in a bit of a unique situation. I would imagine I'm somewhere between a boot camp grad and a 4 yr grad (probably closer to boot camp, I would guess). I've spoken with a lot of people in SE IRL, and my understanding is most of the upper division classes in a 4yr CS degree aren't exactly necessary for job performance. I know that having a 4yr makes me more competitive. KEY POINT:**I am interested in essentially any SE job. I'd be happy writing code for a living for less than what I make now (~$15 in retail).** Front-end/back-end/language/framework doesn't make much of a difference for me. Job requirements near me seem to varied for me to want to specialize too hard just yet. Tentatively willing to move or get a remote job.


My plan so far for getting a job/internship:

1) Personal project(s) ([GITHUB PLUG](https://github.com/Bean-Bake), the BeanCell project is something I'm tentatively proud of. It's probably nothing special, but it's ~1000 lines of self-written code about something I'm psyched on. The to do list isn't anything important to me, just sorta learning a specific tech stack to get my feet wet.)

2) Leetcode grind (not so much I kill myself, of course)

3) Networking via LinkedIn with the companies I'm applying to as well as possibly whoever at my local CC and local university (I live in a college town with a somewhat prestigious 4yr)

4) Hitting up the resume threads here very soon, I'm sure mine is garbage TBH.

5) Focusing primarily on my local small companies rather than the major corporations. Trying to go internship -&gt; job rather than directly to entry level or new grad.

6) Being willing to put in a ton of apps. The figure I've heard IRL is often 100+. Just gotta grind it out and be willing to take the ego hit.

This is all to ask:

**What can I do as a CS 2yr grad to make myself stand out when applying for jobs/internships?**

**Is there anything I can do to sidestep the numerous internships that want me to be pursuing a bachelor's?** I don't necessarily want to be dishonest, but I don't mind getting an acceptance to a 4yr for verification. IDK how much they dig into this.

**Is it a waste of time, at this level of experience, to even try for a remote job?**

There's a thread on this up right now, but it seems mostly geared toward people who already have some experience in the field. **Any preferred job boards especially for internships? Or any better way of sifting?** I'm browsing all the main ones, but it's a lot to sift through a ton of senior/unrelated jobs even with advanced search and such.

**Any other thoughts on my plan or my personal projects?** It's hard to get any real opinion on my work, and I'm just not sure if my github is even worth showing or if it's actually super embarrassing.


Thanks in advance for any/all assistance! Sorry for the essay :)"

Second and third tickets were migration tickets basically just migrating some programs from Java 8-11.

Fourth ticket I built some UI with React.

Fifth ticket I'm writing a script with Python to programmatically create Jira support tickets - I have to access 'Vault' to extract new credentials and send those credentials into a support ticket to update user credentials.

Next tickets looks like I'm going to be creating some Terraform configurations - don't even know what that is yet.

All of these are tickets from completely separate 'projects' that have nothing to do with each other, every sprint I have to spend a couple days just figuring out what the entire project is used for.

While doing my tickets I learn a ton and feel way more comfortable with those technologies and languages than I did before, but because the tickets vary so wildly I can't transfer any of my newly acquired knowledge over to the next ones. Just feel like I'm always swimming upstream and never actually getting better, because I never use what I'd learned previously again."

133,cscareerquestions,Need help with what direction to take in my career,"I've been working as a software developer since 1-2 years now and while I'm enjoying it (mostly), I constantly feel like I'm not using my full potential in other areas and that I'm not being able to explore and learn things in other fields.  For example, I like marketing, psychology, neurobiology, design, music, etc. 

My questions:

1. How do I incorporate my other interests? I feel like the obvious answer to that is to find a company which works on something that interests me, but how exactly? Do I do another degree in something that interests me?
2. I also sometimes feel like I want to go back to school just to study again (which may be because I spent two years of my bachelor's degree at home because of the pandemic). What's the best course of action to take here? What kind of a degree should I get which would help me advance my career (not necessarily in a fully technical role) after a bachelor's in CS/IT?

I realise these questions are very vague and open-ended and I apologise for not asking more specific questions, but I'm a little lost right now and I'm simply looking for opinions about/experiences with this.

Thanks!"

138,cscareerquestions,I am in dilemma.,"Firstly I got a joining letter from an MNC company which hires new graduates in mass and pays them a low bare minimum wage. They put my work location elsewhere despite asking for a preference and said they won't be able to change it. Mind you it also has a bond period of a year. 
Now, the city that I have to move to is very expensive and with what they're paying it's barely enough to make it through the month. I would have to leave everything here, my family, boyfriend, and everyone I want to be in touch with and go there to live like a street animal. 
My heart strongly doesn't want to go. But so many people I've talked to are saying that the market is low and that the hiring will be difficult and you may end up creating a gap in your career. And this whole thing is scaring me plus I have so much self doubt in my skills at the moment(I am working towards upskilling myself everyday). I just feel so down about this and have no idea what to do."

140,cscareerquestions,How do you maintain and improve a repository with multiple teams developing within it?,"Many teams I've been on are ""one repo per team"" so its really easy to manage tech debt &amp; improvements in that paradigm. That single team can allocate and make time for said tech-tasks and communicate amongst themselves. I'm talking about anything NOT related to the product/features themselves:

- tech debt
- ci improvements
- testing improvements
- repo conventions
- code standards


## **However, what if you have multiple teams working within the repo?**

 I'm not talking about a giant monorepo where 20+ people are pushing code. Still a small-medium sized repo, with 5-8 people pushing code, yet not all engineers are on the same team.

The problem is that the different teams have their own ceremonies and process and timelines for their own projects. So how can all 8 people on 2-3 different teams be on the same page of 'tech debt/improvement priority?' and also AGREE that we should do each thing?


&gt; *(this is a fake example)* Lets say Facebook is one single app, but you have a ""Profile Team"" and a ""Friends Team"" and a ""Friends Team"". You all work in the same repo/app and there needs to be consistency across how you develop. In addition, you don't want the app to just become a sandbox common space where people shove their code then wipe their hands clean. You need to maintain it.

&gt; Over time, tech debt accrues. It is very easy for each individual/team to just ""log it as tech debt"" and never address it. How do you prevent the single repo just being a closet that everyone throws their stuff into, and then shuts the door behind them."

149,cscareerquestions,Getting a job VS. building my own apps (I just finished my bachelor's degree)," 

#### What would you advise me to do?

I'm 26 years old and recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I only have 2 months of work experience in a company, but I've created a few Flutter apps and Android apps that are published.

**My dream is to make a living from my own apps!** (But I also REALLY want to travel more)

# Option 1: Travel while making my own apps &amp; using money from my savings

I've been traveling without working in South America for 9 months and it has been the most awesome year of my life! (So I really want to also be traveling the next year).

I want to get as much travel done as possible before having kids because I think it will be more difficult to travel while having a child...

I can travel for 2-3 years on my current savings (I also have an emergency fund of 10 months of expenses outside my savings) and develop apps that I hope will make money.

Worst case: If I don't start making money to live on in those 2-3 years, then I'll get a job for 1-2 years until I've saved enough to travel again for some years.

# Option 2: Travel with a remote job

I can still travel with a remote job, but it will be more limited because I have to work specific days and hours of the week. I enjoy doing 3-6 day tours (hikes, jungle tours, and so on), but these will be harder to fit in...

The positive is that if I make the same amount of money as in my last job and spend the same amount on my travels as this year, then by working remotely and traveling I will save up enough money for 3 years of travel, where I don't need to work and can focus on my own apps.

# Option 3: Get a job in another country to save up money FASTER

Here I would try to get a job in another company with higher salaries than Denmark (USA, Switzerland, Norway, Australia, etc.), and live like a poor man to save up for travels. I estimate that if I live really cheaply then I'll be able to save up more money than I could in Denmark.

The problem is that these countries are expensive, so I would not want to do a lot of traveling there, but just work and save up.

I estimate that I would be able to save up money for 4 years of travel this way in 1 year.

# Option 4: Get a job in my own country (Denmark) and save up for travel

I don't need to get a job now and I really want to travel in the upcoming year, but maybe getting a job now would make me a way better developer, so I'll have more skills when creating my own apps, and by working 1 year I'll be able to save up money for 3 years of travel.

# Creating my own software vs. working for a company as a beginning Software Engineer

So I'm considering if I should

1. Continue using up my savings while making my own apps and traveling another 1-2 years and then get a job if I fail
2. Get a job now (remote job, job in my country or another country) to get more skills &amp; money that I can use for time creating my own apps and traveling

150,cscareerquestions,Emonics Academy,"Hey Guys 

Today I got a phone call from Emonics Academy. The Rep ""Yash"" was calling from New Jersey. 

He told me that Emonics Academy would teach me all about IOS development and would not take any money from me at all, the program is 6 weeks, no paycheck no checks. He pretty much said the funding is coming from companies who was Emonics to train developers to have come and then work for these select companies. 

It has a similar business model to FDM and Revature  how ever, you don't have to take a test, or anything. Anyone can be accepted into the program 🙂 

He then offered me a starting salary of 75k and a 12 month commitment.

151,cscareerquestions,"Reporting issues on the project gets me into lots of trouble, looking for advice","Hello,

I got my first job as a software developer a few months ago and I am looking for advice on an unpleasant situation that keeps repeating itself.

While working on my tasks I keep finding severe bugs or security issues in the project's code (not introduced by me or my team mates). I always report these issues to the team lead and as a result I am tasked to solve them.

The problem is that this results in me having to do an ungodly amount of work compared to everyone else, as I am somehow expected to finish my tasks without delay but at the same time also solve these issues. For example, right now I have to finish my tasks and at the same time refactor a ton of frontend code (make changes to EVERY api call, solve responsiveness problems on some pages etc.) and a ton of backend code (authorization does not work on any endpoint, expensive queries with lots of unnecessary data etc.).

I would expect the team lead to distribute these tasks evenly among the team members but somehow all of these problems always fall into my lap if I report them. 

The only solution I see right now, to avoid being overworked and getting burnt out is to just stop reporting these problems and focus solely on my own and only my own tasks. I really do not like this solution though."

156,cscareerquestions,Possible rejection mistake?,"Recently interviewed for a intern position at a cool gaming company, seemed to pass the behavioral phone screen with flying colors. Hiring manager was very clear I would be moving onto the next round, to the point where he basically told me to harass the recruiters if they didn't follow up fast enough within a week. He explained that the next steps would be 3 panel interviews and a technical with him and the technical would be ""easy for me"" given my experience. 

Its been a week later and I just got the rejection letter today, and the position is still up on linkedin. Are sending rejection letters by mistake something that happens? I'm really confused as I genuinely believe I nailed the interview and that the hiring manager wanted to move forward."
157,cscareerquestions,"No Offer, No Rejection, but Wants to Stay in Touch?","I completed an interview process with a company about two weeks ago and I pinged the recruiter since I haven't heard back in a while. The recruiter explained to me in a zoom call that my feedbacks are positive from the team, hiring manager, and the director, but they want to hire a more senior role first before they make a final decision on me. And they want to check-in every week to give update, which confuses me.

My question is: if they come back to me with an offer after extended ""bread-crumbing"" or stalling, is it still worth to take it? It feels like that hypothetical offer is equivalent of saying ""guess we'll have to hire you instead of our dream candidate""

Tbh, I haven't had many job interview experiences and this one is an oddball. Unfortunately, I do not have any offers on hand or other interviews going on so I think I'll just continue at my current job and see what happens. Sending out more applications might be another option but I have limited bandwidth due to personal life commitments in the upcoming few months."

BACKGROUND: Master's in Physics at top 10 Uni in world, wrote my BSc and MSc thesis' with ML project. Those projects were my intro to programming so I really struggled through them, learning as little as possible about programming along the way. I have been learning Data Structures and Algorithms since I graduated because I hear that they are really important for FAANG interviews and because there is so much stuff to learn that I just had to focus on something. I hope to improve my Python skills doing Leetcode stuff, and have been enjoying it so far.

However, I am quite unsure as to what I actually need to learn? If I just master Leetcode over the next few months, can I grab a FAANG job and then just learn how to be a SWE on the job, or do I actually have to learn to make stuff before I go?

Again, a weird question but I am unsure about what to think because everyone makes out these FAANG interviews to be 100% DS&amp;A."

I’m a materials engineer wanting to go into software engineering and after learning to code on my own I send my resume everywhere and got this role. It’s not a SWE role but can it be used to get my foot into the door?

I quit my last job a week ago due to the burnout (it was a semiconductors manufacturing role) so I’m thinking of taking this role and using the lower hours to grind leetcode. 

My goal is a legitimate software role in 1-2 years."
173,cscareerquestions,"As a person with an unrelated major, Big Tech companies felt like my only viable option when it can to breaking into tech, weirdly enough.","I double majored in two engineering disciplines that had nothing to do with software development or computer science at all. It was a waste of time but I’m not upset because I’m where I want to be now either way. 

I got a cs minor and a small software internship at the tail end of my college career after I figured out I liked this stuff. 

When I was job searching, people told me not to have lofty expectations and to only look at smaller companies. The advice made sense in words but didn’t work in practice. Weirdly enough, smaller companies weren’t an option for me. No one even gave me a chance. 

But big tech companies did because 1) referrals are easy to come by for large tech companies and 2) they have the resources to mass send OA’s to even under qualified candidates. All I needed to do was ace the OA and get a little bit lucky. Also, I liked how I didn’t need to cram whatever CS topics showed up in the job description each time had a phone screen. I literally just needed to practice leetcode and some soft skills, which I was always pretty good at. 

I just grinded leetcode and now I have a faang offer and I’m interviewing at another one. While I was getting my leetcode skills up (took like 7 months), I didn’t get a single on-site anywhere else that wasn’t a scam company. 

It’s kinda all messed up honestly."

Aren't there people out there who will just simply understand things more easily, are able to focus more intently, and in effect learn much much faster?

This can be a bit discouraging in moments where I feel like the second person described above, when things just aren't clicking, when someone explains something and it just straight up doesn't make sense.

187,cscareerquestions,Returning Intern: NYC (again) or Seattle?,"Hey all, so I will graduate with my CS degree December 2023. This last Jan-May, I did an SDE internship with a very large company (rhymes with a certain rainforest) in NYC. Loved the city apart from the winter weather and at the moment it’s my front runner in terms of where I want to work full time (though it’s the only big city I’ve experienced). However, I wasn’t really interested in the work my team was doing, and I was disappointed that I didn’t get to hang out with a lot of other interns (makes sense, it was during the school year). 

I now have two options for my second internship in the coming Summer, and I got about a week to decide:

1. Return to NYC (same team I think)
2. Seattle

Cons of Seattle:
 - I’m not a huge fan of what I’ve heard of Seattle weather so idk if I’d want to live there after graduation. 
 - l really like NYC. 

Pros of Seattle:
 - I think it would be valuable to try the city out and see how I’d like it (didn’t think id like NYC before living there either). 
 - I’ve heard there would be more fellow interns to hang out and have fun with in Seattle, which is definitely a plus for me. 
 - Different team.


Seattle basically seems like the no-brainer choice for my situation. But this is not necessarily an unimportant decision, so I wanted to see if there’s any other input my friends here have to offer! Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated."

We got acquired by a research consultancy company at the beginning of 21. Up until March of this year, my manager was the founder of the startup and I had a great relationship with him. 

Around April this year, he and 2-3 other top engineers left the company. Then, the CTO or whatever from the parent company became my manager. I thought I had a good relationship with him until I submitted my resignation. Guy was disappointed naturally but, he was casual in the conversation nevertheless. I worked hard to help with documentation and proper transitioning in the last 2 weeks. I was supposed to meet with this CTO for our weekly one on one, but he postponed it to 4 pm of Friday (my last day at the company). Just 20 minutes before this meeting, he slacked saying he can't meet with me because of family issues (understandable) but, wants to call me next Monday, when I wouldn't be no longer part of the company. I immediately slacked him thanking him for the support and wishing him and company good luck. He just casually ignored my slack and vaguely responded take rest or something like that. He never once thanked me for my contribution (I was a major contributor for the startup, which earns a lot of revenue for this parent company). I sent out a team wide slack and he didn't respond to that either. Oh and obviously he never called me back. 

Honestly, this probably means nothing and I am just a number to them. But, I value these relationships and the fact that he just avoided me by lying straight to my face is bothering me a lot. Should I send him an email politely saying he should have just let me known that he doesn't want to talk to me instead of postponing meetings and lying about giving me a call back?"

I eventually got an offer from them that absolutely blew the other offer out of the water.

But they're not done with it yet and I'm worried that waiting much longer to back out of the first offer is getting incredibly unprofessional.

Normally I would wait until I'm 100% done with the background check to renege, but the first place has been blowing up my phone for a few days asking what remote materials I need and if my start date still suits. I definitely think it's past time that I renege on that offer but would rather wait until the background check at the second place is completed, just in case. Is it better to wait it out and potentially renege last minute or perhaps more risky, renege while my background check is still underway at the second place?

210,cscareerquestions,How to approach getting your second job?,"So I’ve been in a junior consulting role for about a year now and I’ve learned a ton. It’s been a pretty solid fit for me but the pay is well below market average and I’m looking to grow some more. 

I recently got asked if I’d like to do a phone screening interview for another consulting company and I decided to go for it, but I’m not sure how I should go about talking about my client at my current company. 

Our company has been working with Meta for a few years now to do some of their frontend micro sites and the experience has been great so far. Learning how a company of that size and structure has taught me a lot about working on a large project and I’m really grateful to have been put on this team. 

How do I go about talking about working with Meta? Publicly, I have my experienced listed as “major social media company” but is it okay to mention Meta specifically in the actual interview? It’s the only project experience I have with my current company and I’d like to discuss exactly what I do here.

216,cscareerquestions,Advice on going for programmer analyst in same org or looking for other data analyst positions,"Hi,
Recently joined Reddit and am loving reading through posts in this community. I'd like some advice or thoughts on potential career direction.

Currently I work as a data analyst in higher ed. Since it's not a tech industry, most of the people I work with are not tech, and even though my small office deals with a lot of data, the other people in my office don't know any programming and struggle to understand what a database is. Part of my role has been to interface with an ""IT"" group in my organization to develop a database for storing our frequently-used data (otherwise my supervisor has been running pre-made scripts and storing them in a million excel files). My supervisor recently has indicated that I might be able to pivot my position into a ""programmer analyst"" position for our office, which would entail working more closely with this database, I assume. 

I have 3.5 years total of data analyst experience, but very little of it has been programming. I do some basic SQL queries on a regular basis, but it doesn't get more complicated than that. I am pretty good at VBA, because my previous job used Excel and Excel macros a ton, but I've only been able to leverage that skill once at my current job. Further than that, I have very little exposure to statistics - I'll run a t-test once in awhile, but that's about it. I do visuals in Power BI and Tableau. I am excellent with Excel. I am quite bored in this position and would like to be challenged a little more. Everything I am doing now is quite easy for me.

The benefit of going for the programmer analyst position is that it's within the same organization, which is very stable with funding - I wouldn't have to worry about the tech layoffs happening, and at the same time I may get more exposure to SQL and a better title as well. 

But I worry that staying in this organization is going to stagnate my skills - I feel like it already has. I'd like to do more coding but I've never gotten the opportunity to have any practical experience in it here. Many years ago, I learned OOP, C++, and Python at a beginner's level. I would need a substantial refresher if I were to look into something like that again. 

Is it possible to find either a better data analyst position in industry or something similar with the experience I have? Are people in industry turned off by someone in the higher ed domain? Or would it be better to go for the programmer analyst position at my org before trying to move to industry?"

218,cscareerquestions,Students going for Software Engineering internships: what challenges are you facing?,"I'm a COO within our org's Software Engineering team and working with hiring managers that are getting ready to start recruiting for their summer interns. Our former experiences are showing that students need more from us before, during and after the recruitment process. My managers are trying (and failing) to figure out what undergrad students need to feel prepared for the recruitment process.

**Students in this cohort (or professionals who were once interns): do/did you feel prepared for SE internship recruitment? If not, what types of challenges are you facing?**

I am curious what types of resources would be most beneficial for SE students. Is it networking events? 1:1 mentorship or mentoring groups? A series of info sessions/Q&amp;A on the recruitment process? Technical trainings? 

I would love to hear directly from people facing real challenges, instead of theorizing what students are dealing with and my team coming up with the wrong approach."

I’ve been called out for taking jira tickets too literally. For instance, I was told to join to a certain table and I reported 20% of customers as not being in that table in the power point. I informed them that it would be a huge effort to try to find where else they might be but I wanted to provide an update, yet I was told I wasn’t doing my job by not hunting them down from god knows what tables. That wasn’t in the jira ticket. I keep getting feedback that I’m not doing enough analysis when I answer every piece that’s in the jira ticket. I’m told it’s my job to continue the analysis and find more things even if not explicitly listed in the ticket… is this common practice or bad jira ticket writing? 

It feels conflicting because on one hand we’re supposed to be quick to deliver and iterate but on the the other I’m supposed to be a mind reader for what work needs to be done? Open to suggestions, thanks."

I've been a CS student for 3+ years now, and I've frankly done well in all my courses. However, all that came down to was being able to solve singular problems with algorithms in a handful of files. I have yet to successfully utilize any of the knowledge I've gotten to make a...thing. Hell, I barely understand how you can have multiple files in different languages within a product. I've tried to follow some tutorials on how to build things like apps or websites, but I often feel like I'm just copying them and not learning how to do that process myself. From the more experienced devs, what advice would you give to help go from just being a student to actually being able to develop things?"

225,cscareerquestions,Regarding an internship... I am looking for opinions,"In the past I was rejected at an internship. They told me they had stronger candidates. Fair game and fair enough. 

The point is, in the conversations I had with this company, they told me that in the past they had a lot of students from my college and they weren't impressed. They said things like how bad our college was or that the previous interns failed heavily on the documentation.

Then there are some people at my school that dislike me and I am now wondering.  Could both be reasons why I was rejected? 

They told me that the technical experience and knowledge were there, but also during the conversations, I noticed slight troubling signals and they were specifically asking for the skills I still need to improve. It was like they knew exactly what they needed to ask of me. It could mean someone told them (gossip).

Maybe I am just crazy in the head and I am wrong about this all. I'm not a US citizen, so I don't know the dynamics of intern positions there.

I'm wondering if this ever happend to someone before?"
226,cscareerquestions,"Ghosted by coworkers after layoff, company might be badmouthing me","I worked at my last company for a year and a half or so. I was well liked by the team and got great performance reviews. My lead often praised me and people went out of their way to work with me because I had a reputation of being helpful and approachable.

Earlier this month I was laid off along with dozens of others out of nowhere. Everyone was shocked at this happening. According to LinkedIn a lot of voluntary turnover occurred shortly after too.

The day of I had like a dozen people reach out to me with contact information and they were all sad to see me go. I spoke to some for a day or so after in order to try and network.

But then suddenly, everyone just stopped responding to me, just completely ghosted me. I suspect this has to do with my toxic former company, as my manager would badmouth people who left voluntarily. It's worth noting that this company has a horrid reputation, with Glassdoor reviews into the 2's currently. So effectively they did me a favor.

I don't really care about the interpersonal aspect, but I definitely don't want to impact networking opportunities or my reputation. Any tips on trying to get around a situation like this?"

243,cscareerquestions,Leaving first job with &lt;1 YOE with no offer in hand,"Hi all,

So I joined my current company as a developer right out of college and have been at this job for about 8 months now(out of which about 2 months was spent in onboarding) From the beginning, I am having a hard time at this job( a lot pressure to deliver, too much micromanagement, mandatory pair /mob programming throughout the day, long working hours etc), but was grinding to get an year worth of experience somehow. Due to these struggles my performance and contribution has been taking a hit of late and my manger/leads have been hinting about my underperformance. This is affecting my emotional well-being immensely. I want to switch, perhaps to a different profile (data analytics/ science) which I feel would align with my interests better, but it would take me some months of time to prepare for these roles.It's been a while since I interviewed, even cracking interviews for another development role would take me quite a while to prepare. I used to enjoy programming in college, but this experience has kind of scarred me and I would like to try a different (but related ) profile for the next job at least and may be give software development another shot in the future if I feel differently then. Since this is my first job, I think I would need decent references from my managers/ colleagues when I would be applying for my next job, but since I'm performing poorly, I'm afraid staying to complete a year would further lower their impressions about me which might translate to poor references later on? Would it be better to grind for an year and then leave the job where I might end up with unfavourable references or leave right away with less damage to reputation but with less than one year of experience in resume?If I somehow manage to stay for a month or two more to make my experience 9 or 10 months, would it be okay to put it as an year of experience on resume/would I be considered for roles asking for 1 YOE?

So I am curious as to what those generally may be because I am on a small dev team, one senior dev who works on the backend, me, and their design lead who just kinda writes html/css and a little js.

I said I wanted Angular. But after joining they put me into SAP Development. FYI didn't know what SAP was and just got information from relatives it was a good and blooming tech. Turns out not so much so. I wanted to focus more on turning my career into SWE side.   


After doing around 1.5 months of training and 3 months of working on live projects I find SAP boring and outdated. Moreover I find out by doing this the career shifts more towards Consultant and Business analyst side. I enquired about shifting to different technology but turns won't be possible for at least 1 year.  


I wanted to join FAANG company after 2-3 yrs after working here but am worried if I keep working on SAP won't get the required skillsets for SWE role.  I am hesitant to change company because don't want too many job hops in start of career. What should I do?"

I started learning python on my own and in Mar 2022 I landed an entry level python dev/data engineering position.

First month was just onboarding and some simple tasks. Afterwards I was given a lot of tasks, ranging from small bugs to mini projects. Majority of my work is developing API's with the Python FastAPI framework and respectively creating and managing the database. Below is a list of some tasks I have completed so far.  


• Created Python scripts to load the data from different data sources such as SQL Server/Oracle to Oracle/Elastic/MemSQL/MongoDB  
• Designed databases in MemSQL/MongoDB to support multiple applications.  
• Created Tables, Views and Procedures in MemSQL.  
• Worked on python scripts to load the data from Oracle to MemSQL, Oracle to MongoDB and vice versa.  
• Documented API Definition based on user requirements in Swagger.  
• Used FastAPI framework in Python for Microservices.  
• Built and deployed Docker images to Kubernetes.  
• Created a Githubactions CI/CD pipeline to deploy the microservices in Kubernetes from GIT.  
• Created and modified Database and Database Objects such as Tables, Packages, Procedures, Views, Triggers, and functions in Oracle (PL/SQL).   
• Performed tuning of the code to improve the overall performance of the applications.  
• Answered technical support queries and implements fixes for application problems.  
• To address support issues, proactively worked with cross-functional teams.  
• Monitored Jobs and troubleshoot them if/any errors.  
• Automated Jobs using Airflow.

• Created and managed RESTFUL API's for new and old applications.

• Created API to take user coordinates and return all coordinates from DB within a certain radius forming a 2d sphere

So, Im new at this job as Sales Executive, this week is my second. First time I wales into the office there was a our manager and a tiny 26yo women that seemed sweet, she's sales coordinator. She helped me and made sure I understood everything (that what i thought) BUT, once the manager walked out of the office she started asking ""are you sure you want this job? it's a hard position! maybe you can take my position if you felt it's overwhelming for you because im moving to revenue"". She kept asking these questions/talking this way for two weeks. Worst thing she kept scaring me of my position and she's still doing so. 

I talked about it to my friends and family and they said she wanted my position. I said noway it must be something else. So yesterday a new guy came and turns out she trained him for 3 months, that was 10 momths ago. He's the one taking her position. I realized he's the wanting my position and she was scarinf to quit my job foe him!!! 

So now I have two stupid/childish coworkers trying to scare me, and everything I do is wrong. They exaggerate everything I do, their reactions is so obvious that I can't hold my laugh. The problem is, it's a small office with only the 3 of us and our manager, which is going to leave next week! 

Today I made a good sale, I walked in bragging about it and I was proud, they literally laughed and daid ""NOO this is so bad you sold in a much lower price than what we actually supposed to , Oh my GOD. But it's okay we make mistakes"" and they kept looking at each other exaggerating their reactions. It was so pathetic. I said OH NO, im going to ask the manager immediately, she said ""No, No. don't. It's okay we make mistakes"". I went and actually asked my manager and he said, I did a great job, I sold in much higher price than usual. 

Basically they are doinf all of this show to make me quit or take the coordinator's position.

The company has a bad hiring process (1 interview by people who don't understand the stack for a position they are looking for) and thought they employed mid-level dev, but he knows very little.

Now, as I feel like it's my responsibility for a project to succeed, code reviews per PR can sometimes stretch for like 40 comments per 400 lines of code. I've also set up all the processes in the repo (CI/CD, documentation, coding conventions, we write tests, etc..) so mistakes can not pass as easily to the base branch. I am also trying to be very respectful, and include teammates in decisions, but it tends to be exhausting, as I feel he is sometimes agitated by my code reviews, but he's trying hard not to be. I do feel bad sometimes, but he just lacks stack understanding and fundaments in general (I think the only company he worked for so far was some Indian company). He does have advanced soft skills, which is kind of what got him this far.

Now, after many career counselor meetings and plenty of reading I’ve decided that I want to focus on the tech industry.

The team so far has been super friendly and I really like the people working I'm working with, everyone seems open to talk and very friendly and helpful.

I'm currently on my second sprint and I feel so freaking lost this time. For my first sprint, I dealt mostly with small frontend stuff that entailed 4 line changes or something. I only had 2 tickets and was able to complete them.

However, on this sprint, we're delving more into the backend stuff and I'm just completely lost with the business logic or where to even look. I have zero experience with SQL and one of the tickets is basically writing a complex stored proc. I asked my engineering manager for help on the first ticket and she basically was able to figure it out in 10 mins and gave me the code. I looked into what the code meant and understood it, however, the next day there were some issues and I can't for the life of me figure it out. I'm dreading going back to her to ask for _more_ help, specially after she essentially solved the main part of my ticket. I have spent a whole day trying to solve this and I just can't do it. It feels embarrassing and I feel like the other Jr devs are just breezing through. 

I know that I'm not gonna get fired, but I'm just so concerned of underperforming and just being a drain of value and time. I can see my manager's calendar and it's just swamped, I hate the idea of pestering her with something so small and insignificant. 

I'm nervous I won't be able to complete my tickets this sprint and it's stressing me out. What do I do? Any advice?"

299,cscareerquestions,Should I talk about creating bot scripts for games in my applications?,"Basically, I started my own 'business' last summer, where I took requests and created custom private bot scripts for paying customers. It involved plenty of communication to get their specific preferences, advertising myself, etc., soft skills which an employer would be very happy to see. It also required rigorous testing and checking as if something went wrong, this could lead to negative consequences for the paying customer.

However, it goes without saying that this 'job' could be seen as unethical, and so it leaves me with the question of whether to actually include this on my resume or not. I would not word it as such, but I assume they would ask about it in the interview and so it would be kind of impossible to avoid. The reason I am looking to mention this, is that I am kind of lacking experience for my first job, and feel like this could strongly bolster my application chances.

302,cscareerquestions,How to find a remote software engineering job?,"Okay so I'm hunting for a remote software engineering position in a tech or product company and am struggling a bit with getting replies and interviews. So my main question is; How do people find these roles? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some context: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have 8 years of professional experience (3 years in Python, 3 in JVM based languages and some JavaScript) as a Data Engineer. 

\- Mainly did consultancy type work for local companies. Spent the last year and a half working remotely for an engineering startup in the US. Had a great experience and am looking for a similar role. 

\- I'm based in the EU and don't have a green card. I'm an independant contractor and operate my own LLC, which I use to invoice companies.

\- Judging from the local feedback I've gotten I consider myself to be a pretty solid engineer overall. Not bad, but not godlike either. I did notice that when I worked the remote role that US and tech companies are a different league in terms of their engineering teams. So I'd comfortably describe myself as a senior engineer when talking to local consultancy gigs, and probably refer to myself as a more mid-level engineer when talking to tech startups. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I've been doing so far: 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Scouring through websites of companies similar to the one I worked at, checking their open positions and applying for those if there's a match. 

\- Talking to people I previously worked with attempting to get referrals and recommendations etc. 

\- Haven't worked with recruiters yet, have only ahd poor (local) experiences with those. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, out of roughly fifteen applications I only had three responses. And those came from companies where I knew someone very closely. Generally I feel I'm either doing something wrong or I'm just not used to applying for tech engineering roles (as opposed to the consultancy work I'm used to). 

&amp;#x200B;

Are there ways to amp up the search I'm not seeing? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks!"

306,cscareerquestions,Advice needed - developer or trainer,[removed]
307,cscareerquestions,Career Advice - Developer or Trainer?,"Disclaimer: This post is from my boyfriends perspective but he does not have enough karma to post it himself.

Hi all,

TLDR: I, currently student, got an offer as junior developer next year but then got an offer to be trainer for other developers in this company.

I am studying in cooperation with a company in Europe (3 days a week working, 2 days a week lectures) and I will graduate at the end of this year.
I got an offer from this company to work as a Software Engineer for next year, which I accepted.

The work of this team is more Data related, so you might call it Data Engineering or something like this.
I joined them in January as a student and will be working for them full time next year.
Before joining them I was in a team which was doing more Data Analytics.

I’m not that happy with my tasks because I think it’s more DevOps than development. I work a lot on writing infrastructure templates for AWS and ci/cd Pipelines. 
Development is done with Python. I just had to do a small bugfix, minor changes to existing logic and writing a few tests.

Couple of weeks ago I attended a two week long workshop organized by the company. So trainers were developers of this company.
It was about migrating monoliths to microservices. Language was Java and it was a lot of Kubernetes etc.
I really liked it and did well.

So fast forward to today. I was offered to join them as trainer to teach other developers in the company and also to get more knowledge myself because the trainers proposed me to their boss because one of the trainers will retire from working very soon, so there is an open position.
They sold it to me as a good opportunity for my career because for senior and lead developer it is expected to do such stuff.

I’m hesitant because it’s full time for two years, so I won’t be working on any other real projects for that time.
The workshops itself are always project based, so I will be coding to build the tasks and solutions.

I’m scared to do it because I don’t know if I will be a good enough developer after this two years when I decide I want to go back to work on projects.
On the other hand I’m unhappy with my current tasks because I’m not doing a lot of development stuff anyway.

Do you have any recommendations? I have to decide tomorrow."

Apply now and let's see what happens.""

On my first application, I received both an interview and the job.

Pure luck, that.

I feel guilty about my present employer, to be honest.

He is wonderful and offered me the chance to learn a lot, but I need the full-time pay to cover my expenses.

And you hear about graduates applying 500+ times, getting very few replies. All sorts of frustrations and regrets.

And if lucky, maybe for endless internships and low paid positions in exploitative startups where you work long hours for practically nothing, hoping to land that good position somewhere else.  

Why are there not better graduate development opportunities if there's such a big demand for professionals? It's like no one wants to invest in staff development because people move quickly. So they want experience and so does everyone else. And then they compete for the same experience and pay premium salaries, much higher than if they invested in staff development and satisfaction."

From the moment he leaves until August 26th, he’s leaving me in charge of post-deployment care for a very important (and complicated) process. The process is being deployed on Wednesday and my boss leaves on Friday.

He and some contractors designed the process and it took over 5 months. Part of me is wondering why we’re deploying this now instead of waiting until my boss comes back so he can troubleshoot post-deployment errors. The process uses an interface that only me and my boss know (and I being an intern definitely don’t know the interface as well as him). 

I don’t feel confident enough with my knowledge of the process/interface to troubleshoot errors and run post-deployment care for the process. 

I guess I’m asking if anyone has tips for how to handle this? Or what I should do/ask my boss before he leaves? Do I tell him that I’m not comfortable with this or just see how it goes? Now there’s no one to go to if I have questions 😭😭

328,cscareerquestions,Should I ask the HR why I am getting a salary increase?,"I got a notification of a ~30% raise. I've worked for the company for almost 3 years, got a generous raise in both annual reviews (the third one will be this autumn). 

Recently I had a hard time at work (everyone on our team did) and talked to a colleague about that. Due to the way how I put things, they probably thought that I am about to quit, and passed the message on to the management. Soon after I noticed that managers act differently towards me. They seemed to go easier on me. Which I did not particularly like, because I don't want any special treatment. Then today I got a message about this raise. 

At first I was happy of course, but now I feel pretty bad. I never asked for a raise, I am not sure I deserve it and  that it would be appropriate to sign the new contract. If this were some random corporation, I'd take the money. But it's a smaller local company, I know the director, the teams are very friendly, they really try to take care of the employees. I feel like I've inadvertently blackmailed them to get more money. It was never my intention, I just wanted to vent to my colleague and move on with the work.

So I'm thinking about giving the head of HR a call tomorrow. Saying basically what I said here - that I am grateful for the raise but suspect that it is given to me for very bad reasons. Should I do it? I don't really know what I'm expecting her to say, what she even could say to that.

Hello,

Thank you for all the advice on my original post. I just wanted to give an update.

**TL;DR of my previous post:** Was working for a manager who was constantly threatening to fire me. Also said some things bordering on illegal. Couldn't do much since I'm on a visa.

**What happened after:** I started applying to jobs both outside and inside the company. The manager was first supportive of me finding another team but when I applied to a couple of positions, again threatened me that anyone that applied to other teams is someone not committed to the current role and any other manager would have fired that employee on the spot. 

I went into a very dark place mentally. Who would have thought someone constantly berating your work and threatening to fire you would have negative consequences on your mental health? Interviewed in that mindset and to my own surprise, another team manager in the same company decided to hire me. 

A couple of questions, any advice is appreciated.

**Bad 6-month review:** Our company has mid-year reviews and they are not very important as in they're not tied to annual bonus or anything like that. Old manager gave me a below expectations rating in it. I basically begged him not to do it since I was leaving anyway and that review will screw up the new manager's impression of me even before I start. He said if I give you a better rating, you'll think everything you did here was okay and there are no consequences to it. I still don't understand how someone can be so vindictive but it is what it is. How/when do I bring this up with my new manager?

**No confidence:**  I wasn't a very confident person to begin with(which probably is the reason why the old manager targeted me) but this whole experience has broken me. Not sure how or if I will ever be able to gain confidence back in my work. I'm just filled with a lot of dread and self hate for getting myself into such a situation even though I managed to get out of it with minimal damage.

Thanks again for everyone who responded to my original post, hope you guys see this."

347,cscareerquestions,Should I stay or should I go?,"So I currently work for a f500 dinosaur company. This is/was my first dev job but I've been at the company in other roles for ~5 years. I moved into my dev role and I was grossly underpaid (58k/yr LCOL) I like the company, the benefits, and the culture (super laid back overall) but the tech we work on is old Java stuff. We are adopting things to spring boot but it's a slow battle while we keep up with other required changes that come down the pipe. 

I shot out some applications and got an offer at a big bank for 78k/yr. Woo-hoo! The benefits, vacation,  and retirement are worse but the 20k salary increase really makes up the difference. 

Now my current company has come back offering 70k with a 5k bonus and a raise in October that will bump me another ~3k to keep me. 

Now I'm torn. Both have a TC of 78k, my current and company has better vacation, benefits, and retirement. But the tech stack is lacking. 
I don't know what the banks tech stack is going to look like but I've heard banks aren't really bleeding edge either. 


I'm so torn on what to do. I think the bank will look better on my resume but it seems silly to give up benefits and vacation for the same amount of money. However 5k of that salary is tied to a bonus structure. Further I've already accepted at the bank so I'd have to rescind my acceptance. They'll probably be pissed. 

What should I do?! My head hurts lol."

However when I have to verbally communicate what I’m doing, and when the interviewer is constantly speaking to me, I’m unable to stay focused for long enough to solve them.

352,cscareerquestions,"I want to get a CS degree, but I don't like math. At all. What can I do?","So I've come to the conclusion that I'd like to go to college and get a degree, as the majority opinion around here seems to be that self taught may have been viable at one point, but now a degree is required for most positions in this field. I really would like to get a BS in CS, and I've been doing a lot of research about local schools and whatnot. The thing is, I'm not the best at math. I dropped out of HS in sophomore year and pretty much every year up to that I fucked off in school. I'm 22 now, and I only just got my GED this past April after studying for a weekend. During that weekend, I mostly focused on math, as I knew that would be my hardest test, and I crunched some (mostly algebra) basic math. Ended up passing the test on my first try by 11 points, and it was indeed my lowest score.

So yeah, math scares me. I know CS degrees require a TON of math courses. Terrifying. \*But I don't want math to be the thing that holds me back from doing what I want to do.\* Even though it's on a different scale, I know that at the end of the day, I can apply the same drive that got me through the GED tests and get myself through it. I know I can apply that same drive to college and DO it, it's just that I never did it in high-school; I had a rough upbringing, never thought I would want to go to college in the first place, so I just didn't care, didn't try, and eventually dropped out and started working shitty retail gigs.

The money is there for me to use to go to school, and I want to use it. I just don't want to end up biting off more than I can chew and ending up buried in coursework I can't understand or keep up with. That's my fear. If I choose this path, I can't back out and go to a bootcamp instead or anything like that. I'll have to commit to this plan and see it through. 

Obviously, regardless of what degree I choose, I plan on self-studying and learning coding on my own time as well, so on that note, what degrees would be considered useful to the field that maybe don't require as much intensive math? I was considering a communications degree as that would be a much easier course of study for me, but I just don't know how relevant it would be to the field. I know there are lots of people in the field who have unrelated degrees and just learned on their own how to code. This won't be my primary plan, as I am actually interested in a majority of the courses CS requires, just not the math. 

I'm really unsure of what decision to make at this point. I'm at a real crossroads. On one hand, I really want to go for it and get that CS degree, if for no other reason than just to prove \*to myself\* that I can do it. But on the other hand, I don't want to do that out of arrogance thinking I can do it and end up dropping it because it's too difficult and wasting my time and money. Any advice or wisdom is appreciated."

It blows my mind how much I'm being paid to do this work. My heart breaks when I see people outside doing construction, or people working in customer service / retail.

I've been looking for a job since then, I've probably only done approximately 110 applications (I know this is not a lot but due to some unfortunate circumstances I have severe unmedicated ADHD and anxiety that prevents me from being productive, especially given my current circumstances of being out of work, in addition to how demoralizing my job search has been so far). I've never gotten a reply until recently where I had a local fried of a friend put in a recommendation for me at their company, it's a rust junior position and I'm currently waiting to hear back from the hiring manager but it's taking a while and I'm starting to worry, I'm not exactly well connected and my uni doesn't offer job searching stuff for their CS dept so idk where else I'd even get people to recommend me from (which appears to be the only circumstance where I have any chance).

365,cscareerquestions,I'm hesitating about this field,"
This may be the typical fear-mongering post, long story short what's a realistic perspective on the market in the coming years?

I'm hesitating about getting into this industry because of outsourcing. When I was younger (teens), I had a thing for computers/programming and even went as far as being repulsed by people jobs, however with time I'm feeling that change and now I'm apathetic to working with computers.

I still feel that this is a field that I could grasp well enough, especially since I still enjoy problem solving and automation, however, if it ceases to be lucrative then I think I'd rather focus on a different career path especially since I'm not that invested into cs yet.

I think it's clear that companies want to maximize profits and with working from home being implemented in a robust way, I feel that there would be a race to the bottom in terms of wages because people that live in low cost of living areas aren't stupid.

That's what I'm worried about, is this a reality? Am I being pessimistic?"

380,cscareerquestions,Will Graduate With 2nd Bachelors Degree (CS) in December. Having Zero Success Finding Junior Software Engineer Role...,"I've been applying for the past few months for junior software developer roles and I've had zero success.  I reached the final round interview for a company and had to go through a 4 hour coding challenge, however I didn't get the job.  Then, I had to go through a 3 interview process, first two were an hour and the last one was a 4 hour interview... Didn't get the offer on that one either (this was for a consultant position).  They did tell me to apply again in 6 months and I can skip the first two interviews, so that's nice I guess.  

I've applied to hundreds, no exaggeration, hundreds of positions.  I've only been invited for interviews to the top two companies I mentioned above, and one of them was because of a recommendation.  I'm wondering if the University I'm attending is part of the problem.  My first degree was from a State University here in Texas (marketing) back in 2014.  Now, my 2nd degree will be from Western Governors University.  The reason I chose WGU is because I'm working full-time.  I have a mortgage to pay so I need to work full-time.  Anyways, if this is part of the problem, I'm not sure what to do to show recruiters that I'm capable at the role as those who go to a brick and mortar.  

&amp;#x200B;

Another problem, which I'm sure should be obvious for me at this point, is my resume.  I've been working full-time since I graduated college in 2014.  None of those jobs included any type of programming, however I'm including them in my resume.  Should I remove them?  Should I also remove my first degree as well?  I can't tell if that's making recruiters look past my resume or not.  I feel like it should be important for recruiters to know that this is my 2nd bachelors and that I've worked full time for 8 years now, but maybe I'm wrong.

391,cscareerquestions,Team lead brought up Roe v Wade and things got super awkward. I feel like I might get fired?,"So we were in a meeting when the team lead brought it up.

She is pretty open about her political views, and kept saying that she couldn't believe what was going on. She said she felt like this was a 3rd world country now, and it was being ruined by white men. She also went on a rant for a few minutes about how conservatives and pro-life people are ""the worst part about this stupid country"".

That's fine, she has said similar things before and I kind of just ignored them.. I mean I am there to work not talk about politics.

But then things got even worse.

She said let's do a round-table and get everyone's opinions on this. So she started asking everyone in the meeting their opinions on abortion and Roe v Wade being overturned.

Everyone basically just echoed her statements, some even going further than that.

Then she got to me and asked for my views on abortion. Now, truth be told, I am conservative and I am definitely pro-life. However, I never ever talk about my political views at work because I find it to be very unprofessional, but at the same time I did not want to just agree with her.

So I said that I had no opinion and I had not looked into the issue much.

That's when things started getting awkward.

Things went silent for a second. She asked how could I not have an opinion on something so important? Then she straight up asked me ""Do you think men should control women's bodies"" ?

Again, I said that I hadn't looked into the issue so I couldn't comment. I also said that all of this had nothing to do with work, so could we please get back on topic?

Again there was a long silence, I think maybe at that point she could tell that I was pro-life or something because she seemed extremely angry.

We moved on eventually to talk about actual work.

Now the part I am worried about, is that I received a meeting invite for Monday. It's an hour long and she will be there and so will my director (basically her manager). I asked her about the meeting but she did not reply and logged off yesterday end of day.

So basically I am worried about what is going to happen. Do you think I can get fired?"

I just had an interview and it was really one of the most cringe interviews that I had to deal with. So I applied for a job over LinkedIn for a Frontend role, the company is located in Europe while I live in Egypt, so the employer first off starts by asking me how many years of professional experience that I have and I tell him that I had worked for 3 months as a Frontend Developer using Vue and then I had to take my first year of obligatory service in the army, but other than that I have personal projects that I could show off that show my experience but he seemed to be so fixated on the years of experience thing so he asked me for my previous salary.. I told him it was around 500 euros. it's a low salary cause it was an Egyptian company and that's the mid range really for salaries here for entry level developers. So he asked me for what my expected salary is, and I basically told him the range is between 1500-3500 euros per month in his country and yea given my experience I am happy to have something in the lower range of this till I get more experience, sounds very logical, right? he then completely told me straight up that's he's not willing to pay this type of salary for a someone with basically no experience. He said he's willing to pay me 500 euros per month now cause he'd offer me 'Experience' and this salary would increase the more I grow in the company. Now, I still did my best to keep a straight face but it felt very terrible that he's straight up going to use me like that. Even though that the minimum wage in his country was 700 euros/month! I don't know what do you guys think? This salary on paper is mid-high range for most Egyptian companies hiring New Grads. Am I over reacting? or is this normal for remote jobs?

I'd love to hear you guys' opinions about it

also he told me he'd want me to start immediately even if I don't continue he'd want me to work part-time cause I told him I am also contacting other companies at the mean time. so he told me you can work with us part-time and if you choose another opportunity then go for it but if you choose us, you already have some experience working with us, getting to know the team.. etc etc

so that's all, Thanks!"

398,cscareerquestions,"Recent grad switching to graphics, OS, or compilers from web dev.","TLDR: I want to work on “cool stuff.”

I recently graduated and began my first full time job, and so far I don’t hate it, but I certainly don’t like it either. I’m doing full stack web Dev, and while it’s better than I was led to believe in college (maybe the stigma is just around front end being “dumb people” work?) I really miss the cool projects I was doing.

In college, projects I did for fun included: a small 3D game engine, a C interpreter, and a bunch of unity and unreal engine games. I ended up doing computer graphics research with a professor. My favorite classes were the OS classes. I loved the projects in them.

Maybe it’s because I’m so new and have never had a coding job before (no internship experience before first job) so I’m just not in the full swing of things yet, and I do plan on staying for a little while (maybe I’ll come to really love this work) but when I was in college I really liked doing cool projects. Part of me feels like I’m not really contributing much. I feel like anyone could do what I’m doing, so I don’t have that same pride in my work I had when I was doing my own projects or projects for hard classes.

I wonder how hard it would be to switch to a job like working on Epic’s unreal engine, or finding some low level OS, embedded, or compiler job. I don’t even know where to look for the non graphics jobs. Im also wondering what kind of candidates get hired. I think that now with job experience I might have a reasonable chance at the unreal engine 5 jobs especially if I beef up my engine a little bit.

That’s basically it: how hard are the “cool” jobs to get into?"

402,cscareerquestions,Can interns ask for a raise?,"Just want to start by saying, I really don't want to sound conceded. I know I'm not an amazing programmer, and I know I have yet to graduate. I know I don't deserve more than what I can earn.

I'm an intern at a small company. We have 4 interns. Of them, I am the only software intern. The entire software team is roughly 6 people. We usually contract other companies when we need a large software application. I am very hands on with my company. I'd even go as far as saying I am an asset. A very large piece of our main project was created by a consulting company. Of that work, they created an HMI for our main machine. I worked with understaning and modifying that HMI and recreating it for other smaller machines. Since we no longer consult that company, I am the go-to person when it comes to anything related to the HMI of any machine we work on. I am the only one completley familiar with the software for the HMI. Compared to other employees within the software department, I am doing equivalent work. Not just busy intern work, but actual contributive work. I am paid $20/h which is fine as this is a small company. It's been a few months and we had a meeting with our 'intern advisor' at the company. He was telling us about asking for promotions/raises with reasoning to why you should be given a promotion/raise.

I am deeply thinking about asking the head of my department for a raise. $25-30/h is what I am aiming for. While this is a small company, they are by no means short on funds. I don't want to make a fool of myself, but is this even a thing or acceptable for an intern to ask for a raise? Currently, I live off this income while I am full-time during the summer."
403,cscareerquestions,What is that X-factor that would make you worthy of the Top end compensation?," Hey folks this question has been popping up in my mind for quite some time that whether I'm being appropriately paid and is there something I can do to get to the next level. So I thought I'll just post my thoughts in this sub and let those people answer who have already been in my position.

A bit about myself, I'm a Game developer and have 4 years of experience in Unity, C# and am quite familiar with the process of game development. Would definitely be able to deliver Hyper casual games single-handedly, as I've already done this working for a start-up for the first 2 years. The organization I'm currently at is much bigger and works at a larger scale and my current CTC is in the median range (20LPA INR).

What do you think a Developer with my experience can be valued at in the current market? I'm talking about the high-end and I know not everyone gets that but I just wanted to know what can be done. What are the expectations of a company during the interview? What is that X-factor that would make you worthy of the Top end compensation?

Also I've been thinking about taking some new courses and upskill myself, so If there're any suggestions that would increase my market value please let me know.

Thanks already."

405,cscareerquestions,Legit question: do bootcamp grads get to learn anything about clean code?,"I'm working with bootcamp grads from all kinds of different bootcamps. I notice that their code is often substantially bad in terms of cleanliness. E.g. some examples: people writing code like this:

    var1 = ...
    var2 = ...
    var3 = ...

How am I supposed to know what var1, var2, etc. means? These people don't realize that their code has to be maintained and read by others. Use intention revealing names please... Or placing comments like this all over their code: # return data above a line of code that says return data, # if not None do x, code: if not None: do x. Worthless comments that don't add anything. Or code duplication: pasting the same code over different files while it simply could've been one method. When I explain them things like why methods should preferably have a single-responsibility / be (highly) cohesive or classes should be open for extension but closed for modification they look at me dumbfounded. I get the response sometimes 'Who cares about all that, as long as it works? See it works, why bother?' 

I'm curious to others experiences and also curious whether you learn anything about writing clean / maintanable code during bootcamps? Or only the basics to get things working?"

409,cscareerquestions,SDE with 3 YOE at a smaller company - Should I settle for SDE1 at AWS?,"Hi guys,
I have been working at a small company as an SDE for the last 3 years. I joined here as an intern and was offered a full time position, which I accepted because it would help pay for my college tuition. Over the last year or so my motivation to work here has tanked. I have been in a loop of feeling that - I don't like what I'm working on -&gt; I'm earning less than what I can be earning -&gt; I haven't learned a lot -&gt; I don't have cool projects to show -&gt; how will I get a new job if I'm not skilled enough -&gt; atleast I have a job that pays

Over the past few months I decided to respond to recruiters and prep for interviews. I interviewed for an SDE2 position at AWS purely based on what the recruiter said I should be interviewing for. I did pretty bad on the System Design as I only had theoretical knowledge of how to scale systems and did not trust my own knowledge because of no experience. However I was told they want to offer me an SDE1 position. Currently I have ""sell calls"" scheduled with hiring managers to pick the team.

I personally still feel like a junior or a new grad and have a lot to learn. I'm excited for an opportunity to work with some very talented people and hopefully start my career over. AWS also means almost a 90% TC increase and a 30% increase in base pay (or more if I can negotiate). I do not have any other offers at the moment, I only have a few phone rounds lined up. Should I settle for the downlevel or sidelevel(?) at AWS and take it as a chance to learn and reshape my career? Or should I reject AWS and continue looking for other opportunities in the face of uncertainty?

Thank you for reading! I appreciate any help or advice from more experienced members here."

411,cscareerquestions,Can we stop using salary report sites to judge offers?,"I've been reading a lot of entrepreneurship.  Its a totally different world.

The price you ask is relative to the value you offer,  not your job title.

I realise value is harder to measure,  but employers do this all the time.  They figure out

how many dollars you will make the company,  then offer you pay based on your title and 

years of experience etc.

So the job could make the company a million a year,  but because your ""title"" is ""Software developer""

you only get paid 60k.  


Seem like a good deal for you?  Nope. 

Could you have asked for 250k?  Probably.

413,cscareerquestions,How do you deal with a teammate who needs too much help?,"Firstly, one wrinkle here is that we have a shared activity outside of work, so we're more friendly than just coworkers. This makes me more circumspect about what feedback I'll give him.

He needed to do some configuration between our service, another service, and the authorization system. I sat down with him at least four times to explain how these services need to work together, and he still didn't get it, we had to get on the phone and i just told him what changes to make. 

Multiple times a week he posts about issues he's having, that I have to help him with. Does he try to debug them first? I think so? He's just... not that good at it? And he doesn't take the time and effort to understand how the things work, which would give him the tools to debug more effectively.

Why do I help him? Because I want his tasks to get done, because the longer he struggles, the harder it is for everyone, because he relies on me specifically and it's hard to say no (I've tried before and he gave me a hard time about it).

What do I want to happen? I'm not sure, I don't want him to get fired or demoted particularly. I think I mainly just want my manager and other higher ups to realize that this is another way in which I'm contributing, and to be valued appropriately for it.

Any thoughts or similar experiences are welcome.

TLDR: Have help a coworker a lot, even basically do some of his work for him, I mainly want to recognized for this extra contribution I'm making, what should I do?"
414,cscareerquestions,What username scheme should I go with on everything cs-related?,"I'm getting into web dev, and I would like to separate these cs-related accounts (GitHub, LinkedIn, etc) from my personal accounts. What's important to know is that my first name is 5 letters long and my last name is 4 letters long, so the example ""First Last"" is actually the correct  number of letters.

My website right now is ""[firstlast.dev](https://firstlast.dev)"". My firstlast is taken on most websites. I'm not sure what I should go with as a replacement. I would like to keep it consistent across websites for my own sake (I find it pleasing) but also to avoid confusion with other people. I thought about ""first-last"" (notice the hyphen), but I'm worried that people will confuse it with normal ""firstlast"". Plus, I'm not sure how many websites support hyphen in the username. Then I thought about ""firstlastdev"". I like it, and it matches my website so I bet it would look nice to have them all listed together. My only worry is that it might sound cheesy to have that as my username on something like GitHub. What do you think?

I'm sure most people reading this are of the opinion that it really doesn't matter, and you're right, but it's still somewhat important to me so I would like to hear people's opinions."
415,cscareerquestions,Internship placement woes,"Hey guys,

I landed an internship this summer but I have a major problem. 

There's a couple of us software interns (title that shows in outlook) and most of us have been put in a team within ""tech"".  However, I've been put in a ""data"" team. That didn't concern me too much at first but it turns out that the closest thing to tech, data engineering, is parallel to us. Not what I expected. 

So far from talking with the other software interns, they are gearing up to start dealing with tickets or whatever eventually and are under tech people. I've been given a non-tech related (think excel and non-automatable) project to crack on with. 

I brought this up to my manager casually and didn't really get anywhere. It's a large company and it seems they assigned this as appropriate for an intern well in advance, but I'm not sure why for a software person. I'm trying to think over this weekend and go back to them, though I'm not sure how to. Help pls.

My boyfriend (a dev as well) has moved to the US and I wanted to move with him. I'm kinda stuck at that position for let's say, at least 1 year. I could potentially get another job and apply for a TN Visa but this is not an option right now. The job sucked a bit in Canada but I thought that would much better to work with people in the US. Dear god I was soooo wrong.   


I'm the only one below 35 in my team and I'm working on complicated legacy systems in risk management. The job is highly specialized and the work is complicated. This is not a regular software development job. You need to write code that produce the right data that is being used on a trading floor. The testing framework is non-existent as well as the documentation and you can't find information online since everything is proprietary and kept inside the financial firm.   


So far, no one care about training juniors or explaining how the code work, what it is doing and the business logic. They ""don't have time"" you know.  You all need to learn by yourself. I did great on my first 1.5 year in the team but now this is becoming impossible to keep on without making mistakes without like working 100h a week. If you're integrating too much errors in the integration system (it should be used to test anyway but whatever) be prepared to be judged. Everyone with basically more experience than you is ready to shit on you how bad you are in your back. You send emails explaining something, no one will care. You're ignored, they just care about the seniors workers.   
I explained how it is going in my small team but other teams and managers seem to be much more cool. I just ended up in the worst team you can think of. I want to work with them because they are some interesting projects but that's it.   


Sometimes I feel I can't stay at that job for another 3 years. I never thought such an horrible work experience was possible. I've got basically a couple of options : trying to change team inside the company (keep Visa), wait until I get a green card (2-3 years.....) or leave in 1 years for another job where I can get a TN Visa. I could also learn to deal with it and just realize my coworkers are assho\*\*. This is difficult though, I have the tendency to believe that all that is my fault because I'm not ""good enough"".

I understand that most companies offer 20-30 days PTO per year, and a work from home job could make it possible to travel more.

But with a typical software developer job at Google, Facebook, or Amazon for example, would you be allowed to take unpaid time off to travel? Honestly, I think the maximum time I would want to take off out of the year is about 2 months, which would only be a few weeks of unpaid time off.

So, is this sort of thing mentioned in your contract as an employee? Have you been able to travel a lot while working at a company like this? Or, is this generally looked down upon?

I have \~9 months of full-time work experience so far, with 2 tech internships during the summers at a smaller defense contractor when I was still in school. I honestly like my job right now. Some days the hours are long but the work is actually interesting and the tech stack is pretty modern for a company that's not fully in tech. However, I've realized that NYC is just not for me, and want to leave when my lease ends in a couple months.

My goal is to move to a fintech or tech company in California and try it out, preferably around the Bay Area or outskirts. This is mainly due to wanting to move closer to family. I've started my interview prep, and want to grind it out before I start applying in 2 months. I guess it doesn't help with the tech downturn recently, but I've looked around job listings and it seems like most listings are for &gt;3+ YOE and listings for New Grad positions. I'm definitely not qualified to apply to more Senior positions, and a lot of New Grad positions have a ton of applicants or specifically list a 2023 grad date.

I wanted to ask about the job hunt for people with \~1 YOE. It seems like the doors open up once you get 3+ YOE, but I can't see myself staying here for that long.

My current employer is 100% remote and quite international, so it is rather easy to work from overseas -- but only for as long as I am able to stay overseas on a non-work visa. Conversely, it would probably be quite easy to find an employer willing to sponsor a work visa overseas, but then I would be looking at foreign salaries significantly lower than in the US. Perhaps this is too country-specific to have a general answer (I don't have any particular destination in mind, I'd just like to spend a little more time living overseas while I still have the flexibility)."

465,cscareerquestions,What is the fastest way to move up from junior developer to mid-level developer?,"A little background, I started programming in 2019 and started working professionally in the area as a freelancer in 2021. This year I got a job as a junior in a company. I feel like I can solve most of the problems that fall into my lap, but I still feel like there's still a lot to learn, a lot.

I don't know how it works in other countries, but here in Brazil there is a big difference in salary between a junior developer and a full developer. So I won't be a hypocrite, one of the biggest motivations for me to want to level up as fast as possible is to earn more money as quickly as possible."

I’m weighing the odds of moving to either Houston, TX or Denver, CO. I’m currently in the tech industry, and I really like the Denver area, but I don’t want to stunt my career growth.

I have two virtual on-sites this week for Dev positions and I just have no idea how to prepare. They’re both white boarding interviews - neither companies are big players in the tech world, but they’re big player in their own industries (one sports, one media).

I thought I should be able to solve those but most of the time I end up coming up with brute force solutions that always exceed time limit. I can't seem to come up with ""clever"" solutions by myself.

Also, I can't believe a lot of easy level problems involve dynamic programming. Whenever I see a problem that I can't solve (not even brute force), almost always it turns out it's DP (when I look up solutions). I used to think DP is a pretty advanced topic so I'm quite surprised that they appear in ""easy"" level problems. I watched few YouTube vids on DP and the explanations are simple enough, but I feel like it's a whole different story when trying to implement them in an actual problem."
483,cscareerquestions,Being taken seriously.,"I have a good role at a fairly well known company and I find it difficult sometimes to be taken seriously. It's really hard to explain and is sort of a feeling and not really something that can be measured. I graduated with my b.s. in compsci in 2013 and have been working ever since so I'm pushing a decade of experience. This is my second job that I've been at for 2 years or so, and I was at my last job for 7 years. (Counting an internship while I was still in college). 

Sometimes when I speak up in team discussions what I say is immediately dismissed and I feel this weird pushback like people don't want me to be talking. I feel like if a different person had said the same thing that I did it wouldn't be dismissed. 

I feel like my code is scrutinized sometimes. We have mandatory code reviews before we can merge a PR so we are kind of all checking each other's work all the time, but it feels like there's more of a spotlight on mine. 

An example is that I recently released something I wrote to prod, and it was working OK but after the release I was asked in a pretty public forum (standup) to go back and make it more efficient. Making it more efficient involves going into a library I used and making a code change and release of the library. I see this as a waste of time, what I did doesn't have any bugs, it's just spending an extra few days to optimize something that isn't broken. Plus one of the people asking this approved the PR of the original change. It just feels degrading and I'm certain if I asked this of another member of my team they'd push back. I pushed back and haven't done it yet and am so far hoping they forget. 

It really bugs me because it isn't something I can quantifiable measure or have any reasonable proof, just a feeling that people don't take me seriously. 

Is there anything I can do to prove myself more and make people take me seriously? Like what are some tips or strategies I can use here? Or maybe is there something I can do to either confront my team or prove that my feeling isn't just me imaging things? 
I feel like it might be because I'm female but I'm honestly not even sure at this point."

My instinctive answer to the question of ""why did you use X to accomplish Y?"" is usually along the lines of, ""because that's the first thing I came across/was suggested to me and I don't have enough experience to have any opinions otherwise"" but that doesn't exactly impress.

489,cscareerquestions,I did it!,"Hey guys, im excited to say that i got my first internship. It'll be a frontend capacitation program, with a lot of projects involved. There's a chance of being hired (as a trainee or jr) at the end of the program, and i will aim for that.

Here's some details i believe will add value for beginners like me:

My background in front end is 0 (just the basics of html);

At the interview, all i could talk about is my history with python, i actually have very little experience but reached the oop level, and same thing with java, but i learned that forcefully at uni (i'm at my 1st semester). the interviewer asked what would i do if they offered me a backend internship, and i basically said im not in a position to do that, i am just grabbing the present opportunities.

What they were looking for is people who are good to work with, and i have demonstrated that through communicating in a enthusiastic but assertive way. My friend who has a little bit more knowledge than me was rejected, mainly because he was so stiff in the interview.

They are looking for someone who is constantly learning, thats why its an advantage to get your first job if youre at uni. its something that certificates your constant study in the area.

For those of you who are trying for an internship, i can tell you i that presenting yourself as someone who is eager to learn and easy to work with is the best thing u can do. And i know u gotta pay your bills, but, if possible, u should care more about the experience you are gathering than salary."
490,cscareerquestions,I got a position in a big Fortune 500 company using Ripplematch and you should consider using it especially if you’re someone trying to get their first job," I’ve been in the same position that many new applicants find themselves in. Many new applicants here are trying to get their first SE or dev gig; I personally was trying to branch into Data Science, a nice but competitive career, as the demand for entry-level graduates is low while the supply of entry-level graduates is high. I was sending out application after application on LinkedIn, Indeed, or via the company’s website with limited responses. I think from January 2021 - April 2022, I sent out between 700-1,000+ applications, and over that time, I got \~10-20 interviews. I’ve met with university resume advisors who improved my resume to be in a more presentable shape. Afterwards, I met with a FAANG engineer who came to campus as part of a career event and they said that my resume was pretty solid after the resume improvements. However, I was still not receiving interviews, let alone offers. Here’s the [resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EktJT6uyrTU9M5-eB9gdNIx3cTcdRmWvpITYXPGuenw/edit) if you want to look and critique (it might be a horrible resume and I just got bad advice from everyone who helped) 

&amp;#x200B;

I got acquainted with Ripplematch after applying to a couple of positions on LinkedIn and getting hit up by the recruiters telling me to make an account and apply there (tbh, it sounded a bit scammy but I was desperate for work). Ripplematch is a tinder-like job board that tries to match you with jobs based on your resume/profile that you create. This leads to you having a higher chance of landing an interview when applying for a company through Ripplematch, since you’re being matched with jobs that you are likely to get an interview in and Ripplematch will skip through the bureaucracy and notify the company about your application (not to mention that companies are paying a lot of money to use them). You can’t search for jobs, rather you’ll have a queue of jobs that you can scroll through that match your specifications and can click “Easy Apply”, “Not Interested”, or “Next Match” (job stays within queue and you can circle back later if you want to apply or not). What’s really good about them is that they’ll match you with jobs based on the job description and not the title, something that I wished I learned earlier cause I was rejecting jobs that fit what I wanted to do, but didn’t have the title that I wanted (like I was rejecting jobs that said “IT consultant” and was confused why I was getting recommended these jobs only to read their description and having the description match exactly my skills and expertise in data science). This is good because there are going to be knuckleheads like me who pass up these jobs because they don’t have the advertisable title that people want, putting you in a better position to apply and secure that interview. For more info, you can read about them [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinstoller/2021/04/20/need-help-landing-a-post-grad-job-this-startup-says-it-can-give-you-a-60-shot-at-scoring-an-interview/?sh=71d650d41669).

 

For me, I didn’t use the service too much, just browsed what was in my queue and rejected jobs that I was perfectly qualified for because I didn’t read the details. However, I came across my dream Fortune 500 company, we’ll call it company X, on Ripplematch. I personally like company X since I like the work they do and they have amazing work-life balance. The position there was a two-year leadership rotational program that I applied to back in November and never heard anything back from. I applied again to that same position on Ripplematch around the middle of March, and the very next day, Ripplematch notified me that company X wants to connect with me. Seven days later, I was set up for an initial interview with company X. After some time and interviews, I secured the position, signed the paperwork, and currently am set to graduate with a job on hand! 

&amp;#x200B;

I’ve been recommending all my friends in real life to use Ripplematch to get their first job, as for me personally, the fact that companies are more likely to respond to you on Ripplematch is a feature that is uncontested compared to other job boards that I’ve used before. I believe in the product and I think you should use it if you’re trying to break into different CS-related fields. LMK if you have any questions, good luck on the job search and I hope you get the position that you want!"

I'm returning to the UK this summer and am thinking of transitioning to some sort of programming job since the job market in sports science is pretty bleak...

I'm currently self-learning Python via a Udemy course and I'm enjoying that and find it very interesting. I enjoy problem solving and being able to create things sounds very appealing to me.

I'm just wondering how feasible it is to get started as a self-taught programmer or would it be wise to try and gain some more formal qualifications (such as HNC/HND at college)? I'd rather avoid having to spend another 3-4 years at university if possible.

Reading the diagrams dont really help


Granted I'm almost 2 months in, but I felt like I kind of giving up.

Or am I just too not in touch with reality, kinda wish I can pull an all nighter and being able to review all the pull requests the next morning hollywood style? Should I have lunch with the non tech people like supply chain people to understand what they're doing? lol
should I read the code and take note of all the features? but is it worth doing? should i just try to understand the feature relating to a card im working on? but that way i dont understand my colleagues' cards and a lot of the meetings.

496,cscareerquestions,What can I do to convince employers that I am qualified?,"I have been applying to entry level developer positions (I'm interested in systems programming) and my application is almost never progressed (like 1 in 50). When I do hear back it's usually for the employer to tell me they found someone more qualified, or that they don't think I'm a good fit for the position. The thing is, I graduated recently with a BS in computer science from a top university and should have an MS in software engineering by the end of the year. I had a B/B+ average, so not bad, but generally don't put GPA on my resume anyway.

I had a single job advance me to the interview stage. I did well on the first tech interview but they threw another tech interview in at the last minute. I eventually figured out a solution, and I did my best to show my knowledge and process even as I got stuck around the middle, but I guess I took too long or asked too many questions for the interviewer's taste because he apparently told the company I wasn't qualified and they ended things with me pretty quick.

Obviously this isn't the way I wanted things to go but I'm more worried because I feel like I am getting more complaints overall about not being qualified for basic, entry level positions than I should be based on my qualifications (I heard a good rule of thumb was getting 1 call back for every 10 or so applications, not 1 in 50).

It's not my first job ever, but it will be my first substantial software engineering position and it's age old ""need experience for job/need job for experience"" dilemma.  But the whole idea of going to a solid school and getting CS degrees was to help with that, and it doesn't seem to be helping.

I'm wondering what sorts of other things people have done to convince employers of their qualifications. Aree personal projects good? Maybe contributing to open source software? I'm looking for anything I can do that'll get me in the door"

For context, I used React a couple years ago with guidance and building small projects, so I am familiar but will certainly have to learn it all over again. So I do have exposure to React (not native), Node.js and PostgreSQL, however, I forgot a lot of the back-end stuff as well.

So to reiterate, should I focus on vanilla JS to the point I can build small projects/basic dynamic websites or since I am able to read code and understand concepts, just move on the React and focus on building projects confidently in that library?"

516,cscareerquestions,Taking a boot camp and am forced into groupwork. One person decided to do it all.,"Mainly venting but would appreciate insight too. 

So we usually have assessments that we work on over the weekends. It’s a decent challenge to solidify what we worked on during the week. Usually I have no problem doing them by myself but this week we got placed in groups of 3. 

The one has no clue what is going on whatsoever…”what is a code block?”. We’ve been at this for 10 weeks, where have you been?

Then the other one decided to stay up late and finish half the project for us on Monday. I was flabbergasted because I figured it was entirely obvious that we need to work on it together during class for the rest of the week. I confronted him saying that the instructors will be able to see who did what in git, and will likely be looking for a more or less even distribution of work because that is the real goal of this project. 

I figured it was a lesson learned and we can all move on. We distributed some work to try to even it out. I was trying to get my bearings because you need to have some time to acclimate yourself to someone else’s code, especially when they fast forward the project unexpectedly like that. 

Well, while I was doing that, he stepped on mine and the other student’s toes *again* by just finishing the other half of the project. It would have been lovely to just get it done by myself, but I decided to include the others, as if it was, you know, a group project. Call me crazy 🤷‍♂️ 

He met all the requirements on his own so literally all that’s left to do is making it pretty. I feel completely defeated because I communicated my boundary and it was clearly ignored. It’s going to look like both of us were incompetent when in reality, he wouldn’t let us get any code in edgewise. I hope that there aren’t any consequences because I truly didn’t see this coming."

522,cscareerquestions,Need advice for career switch to Software Engineering (US),"I am a 35 y/o military SM considering a career swap into private sector software engineering.  My educational background consists of biological/medical sciences (1 x BS in Kinesiology, 1x BS in Biology, and 90% of the coursework/clinical work of a Physician Assistant program). My professional experience has been military HR as an officer - essentially a ton of hyper specific technical knowledge with a massive wealth of leadership/managerial experience. My exposure to software engineering has been very limited and consists of a single class of python coding I had to complete during my undergraduate, but I recall very much enjoying the process of using code to solve unique (and admittedly simplistic) problems that do not have a single solution.

I've recently gotten married and my wife and I strongly considering expatriating.  Unfortunately the PA is a largely non-transferrable concept to other countries and I still want a family that medical school, or really residency, just isn't really conducive to.  Which brings me back to my second interest in school outside of medicine, coding.

With all that said I'm not sure exactly how best to jump in.  From what I've seen there are essentially 3 paths - self-taught via udemy/coursera, bootcamps, and formal degreed education.  I'm trying to find the best and quickest path for me given my current resume. I've read that the former two paths can be difficult to get started with as they churn out a ton of competition, but I wonder if there's significant benefit for me grabbing a third BS degree and the time investment is definitely the greatest.  I haven't utilized my GI bill yet so financially none of the choices are out of reach.  Looking for any advice your experiences can provide. Thank you!"
523,cscareerquestions,My career is over before it's started. Do I have any viable backup careers? Fighting debilitating ADHD in my daily life.,"**Background:** I came out of uni with a CS degree. I now have 2 years of IT Project Management and 3 years of SWE all at large name tech companies. I've worked as a business analyst, software engineer, project manager, and more. My lifelong goal was to keep gaining experience and certificates and angle into a FANG project/product management position. I enjoyed high level problem solving and leading meetings more than the actual technical aspects of the work itself. 

**Problem:** Not to belittle others, but I probably have the worst case of ADHD anyone has ever seen. Life crippling ADHD (took me 8 years to get my drivers license/GED without meds), extreme OCD (like I can't leave the house without flipping my lights OCD when it's bad), generalized anxiety (I don't really feel anxious on a day to day, but certain things get me really worked up), and more. My medication over the past 6 years is already having extremely diminishing effects, I can't keep up the way I'm going or keep increasing my medication. 

**Summary:** I can't work positions any longer that require substantial freedom, planning, critical thinking, self motivation, more. I really don't know what would work for me, a job that's literally only meetings and presenting information, or maybe something with urgency, or something with more clearly defined tasks? One of those, or maybe something completely brainless. Honestly, I am about to write off desk/tech jobs in their entirety, because that's how bad my condition and work related difficulties are in my own eyes.  

***TL:DR -*** ***I can't work in the same areas I have been anymore.  I'm honestly about to swear off every job that involves a desk that isn't 100% brainless due to my struggles (see summary). I know you awesome people are probably going to encourage me to rethink things and keep trying, but that's not what I'm here for. I've had a really hard time with this but the decision is made: health/family &gt; work (my wife makes a 6 figure income as well). I'm strictly looking to see what options I have regarding career choices that won't be as mentally strenuous.***"

530,cscareerquestions,Code-debugging problems?,"Hi all,

I've recently had a graduate-level technical interview where I botched it up, the tasks were nothing like Leetcode or algorithm design questions, but more like ""here is some code that is supposed to accomplish X, and here are some unit tests that are failing at the moment, now please fix the code"". I did not have enough time to find all the errors in the code.

I would like to make sure that I am not taken aback again and that I am better prepared for my next interviews and assessments. Therefore, I would like to ask:

* How widespread is the use of such debugging tasks in interviews? 
* Is anyone aware of any practice sites that have similar types of code-fixing questions? 
* Is there anything else other than algos, data structures and Leetcode that I would benefit from preparing on?

For context, I have decided to switch careers into software engineering (from a non-CS STEM background with some exposure to programming), and have got some interviews for graduate programmes coming up. I have been preparing for those by reading up on basic CompSci concepts (algorithms and data structures, time complexity, basic computer architecture) and practising Leetcode questions.

Any tips would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!"
531,cscareerquestions,"Fellow automation engineers, I have some questions for you.","Hey guys, 

Just some background, you can skip to the bottom if you don’t care:

I’ve been working at the same company since I graduated with a CS degree in late 2018. I was hired on specifically to automate reporting processes for an IT Security team. Being on an IT team, I was given the title of “Information Security Analyst.”

As time went on, I quickly became the Python SME and the most senior automation person. I automated many things, from simple Excel manipulation, to complex pipelines that combine data across multiple tools/networks/APIs. I gained a knack for big data analysis, and was put in charge of metrics for the team. My automation has become the backbone for reporting across several teams. I became the Python SME and the go-to guy for custom reporting or big data analysis. I was promoted to “Senior Information Security Analyst” last year. 

The thing is, despite my strong suit and day-to-day being automation and analysis, I was still working on an IT team. This means that I never had a mentor when it came to automation. I never had anyone to review my code, teach me industry standard tools and techniques, or point out mistakes to me. Everything I have learned and done has been on my own. 

I have gone out of my way to ensure that the code I write adheres to the principles I was taught in school. Everything is built with abstraction, efficiency, and scalability in mind. The stakeholders are happy, my boss is happy, and I like to think I do a good job. However, without other experienced engineers around, I have no idea how well I’m *actually* doing.

Earlier this year, I managed to get my title changed to “Security Automation Engineer,” and was finally relieved of most of my IT specific duties. I asked for this title change, because I do not like IT, I really do not like the number of certifications those guys are expected to get, and I want to pursue a career more focused on the things I do enjoy - namely automation and big data analysis. 

So, with all of that in mind, here are the questions I have for y’all:

1.	Do you work alone/with a few others, or is there a dedicated automation team?
2.	What are some of the industry standard tool and libraries that you use? Things for like API interaction, testing, deployment, etc. IE Postman, Pycharm, Pandas
3.	What languages do you write in? 
4.	if someone like me were to join your team, what concepts would you expect them to have a grip on? 
5.	How often do you perform data analysis, or is that just unique to my position?

That is all of the questions I can think of right now. I really want to pursue a career either automating things or analyzing data sets. Just need to make sure I have the skills to match my title before I go make a fool of myself in interviews. 

Thank you!"

I struggled for half an hour and could not complete it. It would have been a 5 min job with regex. But I was completely stuck because I could not think of any solution that would be less complicated than Regex. 

It turns out that there was no elegant solution, and the ""model answer"" was extremely convoluted and involved a bunch of variables and if statements to handle multiple edge cases. Meanwhile I could solve it with regex with just 5 lines of code.

548,cscareerquestions,First real shot,"I am a student at WGU for CS. I have been spamming apps for internships and jr sec roles for the last 3-4 months. I’ve gotten a few screenings including a couple FAANGS, but was never successful enough for a face to face interview. I currently work as a bar manager/head bartender, and my regular guests are really my only professional network. 
Well one guest in particular has been a huge advocate for me, connecting me with a lead engineer in her company to give me advice and potentially refer me. After my conversation with him, he explain that inter positions were closed for the year and that he didn’t have anything for me. But the advice was great and I appreciated the support! But this was not good enough for my friend. She then proceeds to refer me to a real third party local recruiter. During our first conversation, it felt like it was going a similar way as the previous, but at the end he told me about a “support team dev” position at a local refinancing company. It was enough to peak my interest so I forwarded my credentials to him. 
My recruiter was blown away by my GitHub. In my opinion it is nothing special. No project is particularly innovative. But what it did show was consistency and improvement, with a total of 300 commits spread across a little more than a year. He said that it was a great thing to have and he would be in touch. 
After applying in my behalf and getting a “one and done” interview, I was thrilled. On the day of the interview, he informs me the company is rescheduling because they want me to interview with the head engineers for a front end application engineer. I almost lost my shit. I was so happy but also so tired from rehearsing all day. 
When i finally meet with the team, they are very impressed by my interpersonal skills and level of preparedness. I had been using React but studied Vue over the weekend knowing that’s what they used, which also impressed them. 
At the end of the interview they gave me a GitHub repo to fork and complete a component and corresponding Vuex store. They gave me 72 hours to turn it in, and I finished it in 6. This is including the time it took to watch a crash course and read documentation. I am certain I did it correctly   All tests and linting passed, and my recruiter even gave me the notes from past failed candidates, and I made sure to cover all those bases too. I turned it in mid day two days ago. The lead was out yesterday on PTO, and I have not heard anything today. My recruiter says no news Is good news. But I am FULL of anxiety.  I can’t do anything productive until I know for sure. I can’t take it ! I know this sounds like I am complaining and I’m not. I am very grateful and understand that even a “no” is still a success as I have come farther than ever before. 

I guess I am making this post just to vent, and it’s already helping. If you have any anxiety management tips or words of advice, I would love to hear it. 

I also want to say thank you to this community! Reading this forum has become habitual, and I have learned quite a bit.  

Good luck all and have a good day."
549,cscareerquestions,Is this normal?,"I applied for an internship, passed the initial screening and received a technical quiz. it was for a backend position for someone who knows Golang OR ruby and has some database knowledge.

 I applied since I knew basic Go(finished the code academy course) and finished my databases class this semester. I started the quiz and it was very hard, asking me about Ruby(even though they asked for knowledge in Ruby OR Golang), Rails questions, some actual hard database question(something about trees and leaves and indexing and stuff I didn't even learn in my database classes).

The Go questions where ok till they asked about Async Go, I understand the concept behind Asynchronus programming but haven't really used it( I'm only a second year student).

To my understanding, The technical questions/interviews for entry level positions are usually problem solving/leet code that tests my mindset and ability to learn, not test me on the knowledge I'm applying to acquire at the first place. I mean if I knew all that why would I apply for an internship to begin with?

551,cscareerquestions,Am I rationalizing or general software engineering is indeed more fun than fancier roles like ML/AI/Data?,"I'm a CS graduate and work as a full-stack web developer. When I was in college, it was quite common that normal software engineering was not that prestigious and people (myself included) would think that ""cool"" things are usually done in newer fields like AI (ML in particular).

So I took a few AI/ML classes towards the end of my CS program and they were quite fun honestly, lots of cool concepts. However projects felt a bit mundane, and honestly a lot of what was happening couldn't be explained that much, you kind of toy with parameters and different sets of data to finally reach a good result.

I've now kind of lost my obsession with these fields. Maybe it's because I'm lazy for the study it needs to enter these fields and it's just copium. But I honestly think normal general software engineering that you have a decent foundation of CS and then acquire the knowledge you need and build cool stuff satisfies me much more than being a research scientist or ML scientist (and honestly most great products are built this way as much as I can remember). Good software engineers are paid as much as (or even more) than these fields too, so there is no money incentive either.

One thing I fear is that by distancing from deeper ML/AI stuff, I consequently couldn't come up with good engineering ideas related to these fields.

So what do you think?"

574,cscareerquestions,How long as a Jr developer did you wait to look for a new job?,"I definitely have A LOT to learn currently, I'm trying my best to pick up new things and although the pay as a junior isn't the best, I'm wondering if I should look for a new job or stay here and keep learning?

I'm learning a lot, but if I can learn equal amounts elsewhere with better pay, then why not? Although what I don't want to risk is a largely different work environment/culture that I might not like. Although it's really tempting listening to other Jr's talk about making much more than me to look elsewhere, especially with prices of things going higher.

I want to hear about other Jr developers experiences and how you made that first big switch, how quickly was it? How did you manage LC, prepping, looking for jobs, and also your hobbies and time for things you like? I've only been in my current role for 3.5 months and the company really needs developers so I don't feel like abandoning them, I really like everything about the company, but pay is the only negative.

What do you guys suggest I should do?"
575,cscareerquestions,Should I accept a non-CS job while applying to CS roles,"I'm a recent graduate, and I got a job for a super entry level help desk role because I really need money. I know this is unethical, but my plan was to work for a couple months and then quit when I got a software engineering offer. I wanted to get advice on if this would be okay down the road. I want to be a software engineer, and I have been interviewing a ton, just with no luck, but I believe it's a numbers game and I will get there eventually. I just can't afford to not have a job while I wait for an offer that may take months and months to come because I have rent to pay and not a lot of money left.

Anyway, hopefully this makes sense. I would appreciate feedback on this plan. Do you think I should take the help desk job while I apply or no?"

582,cscareerquestions,"Need to update Linkedin, network, create website, github, and get my brand out there. However I’ve been trying to lay low from dangerous people from my past","Long story short, my life today is a complete 180 degrees of where I was 10 years ago and before. I’m the only one of all my former friends from childhood who attended college and has a full time job with benefits. 

Came from a rough situation (poverty, single mother, shit neighborhood, escaping abuse, ect). I had issues as a kid given my environment and my mother having issues back then too, missing father, ect. The area I grew up around, peoples’ parents were working menial jobs, blue collar jobs or had no jobs at all. When you’re a kid who got issues and you’re in a difficult situation, you befriend difficult people from similar circumstances as you. They were like brothers to me and we all went through so much adversity together. These people turned out to be emotionally unstable, narcissistic, irresponsible, highly egotistical, parasitic, always drama queens, ect. 

Long story short I went to college, made new friends who were positive, healthy, balanced people who had career goals. These friends were influential in making me the person I am today. I cut off probably 98% of all the people I knew from before college, since they turned out to be toxic, destructive and dysfunctional adults. In college and a little after, some were always trying to leech off me. Most were always talking shit and acting like immature angry kids. And all of them had zero direction in life. And all were like crabs in a bucket of crabs. And they weren’t happy I made it. My therapist and my friends from college were telling me that my old friends were very toxic and even potentially dangerous people. 

I gradually cut off a lot of toxic people. And they didn’t like that. A lot of these people were extremely egotistical and vindictive. I’m saying these people hold 10-15 year sadistic grudges and have bragged to me about some fucked up shit they did. 

Some friends who turned against me and threatened to kill me and turned people against me, who I then cut off 12 years ago still try to contact me, and have used a bunch of fake accounts and numbers to contact me. They were normal and chill up until high school ended and they went through some personal stuff, then flipped on me.

Another friend I cut off 8 years ago at that time was bragging about stalking people he didnt like from 10 years prior (our middle school days), and stabbing out their tires and sabotaging their car engines/suspensions. He was normal during our childhood, but had some major issues with an abusive dad and brief homelessness. And not to mention poverty. My tires get random staples in them every once in a while until I got a dashcam. That friend also abused another friend of mine and tried to take over her life, even years after she cut him off. I wouldn’t be surprised if he made the news one day.

Another old friend I cut off 7 years ago was a fairly normal guy in our youth, other than coming from extreme poverty and being undocumented. He went through some crazy personal trauma for a few years and a place he worked under the table at was abusing him. It unlocked some pure sociopathy in him. Long story short he is extremely vindictive and very charming. He infiltrated some of my college friend groups and wreaked havoc. Despite blocking him on everything, he still tried to contact me. He even found my work email was sending me some disturbing messages recently, which I reported to HR. 

I want to get my name and my brand out there to find a job, but I’m scared that some dangerous people from my past will find me. What if they try to sabotage my job hunt? I am pondering a name change, however will it be a red flag for recruiters?"

591,cscareerquestions,Non-Competition Clause Question,"Hello,

I just got a new job as a Web Developer, and about to finish up my two weeks at my current business. I just got the contract to review for my new job as a Web Developer for a design and development firm. This is in the contract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;In Consideration of the premises hereof, the opportunities offered by this employment, and other good and valuable consideration the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Employee hereby agrees that during the term of the Employee's employment, and for a period of one (1) year following the date the Employee ceases to be employed by the Company, the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, whether it be through self-employment, or through any other employer,  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;a. compete with the Company in the province of &lt;WHERE I LIVE&gt; or in any other province of Canada where the Company is then conducting business, or  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;b. participate in the ownership, management, operation, financing, or control of, or be employed by or consult for or otherwise render services to , any person, corporation, firm, or other entity that competes with the Company in the province of &lt;WHERE I LIVE&gt;, or in any other province of Canada where the company is then  conducting business, in their similar business as conducted and as proposed to be conducted by the Company.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;c. Should the Employee not be aware of the areas where the Company is conducting business, the Company shall upon request inform the employee and provide confirmation of the locations involved.

This clause makes me wary and uneasy because when I read this, it basically says ""If you stop working here, you can't get another job or start your own business in Web Development"" which seems insane because that is what I went to school for and what I have experience in.

Does anyone have experience with non-competition clauses and how I should move forward?

601,cscareerquestions,What's your take on labour unions in the context of tech workers?,"I know people tend to associate labour unions with blue collar work but that is not necessarily the case - teachers, academics, medical professionals, lawyers are all examples of knowledge-work professions where unions exist and are well.

Personally, I believe that tech workers, or software developers more specifically, could also benefit from unions. Yes, on average a developer is in an economically advantageous position but why would that be a reason to abandon collective bargaining power as a tool to make our working conditions beyond pay better. For example I'd love if 3- and 4-day working weeks (with pay adjustment) became more of a norm, but this is extremely difficult to negotiate as just an individual, vs an union talking to employers on behalf on the workers and negotiating the option for more flexible working arrangements.

My feeling is that collective bargaining is not a thing in our profession because coders tend to proudly assume that they're too smart for union to negotiate on their behalf and instead they'd be better off doing their own talking. This is of course wrong because you can still do your own talking and negotiating with an employer, and a union is just harnessing the power of teaming up with other smart people to collectively argue for *extra* good stuff.

Anyway, what's your take on that? Would you consider joining a union if a colleague mentioned wanting to unionise? Do you think I'm wrong and unions are a bad idea? Interested to hear what an average developer thinks about it all."

However, current job is actually very slow recently and I feel like more of a PM than a S. SWE, and I will need to relocate to another city in mid-July.

I want to hire juniors, and the team wants to do so, and we're trying to pull together a program that would work.

So, I have a few questions. In aligning incentives, the truth is that it can take 6-12 months to where a junior developer is able to contribute at a meaningful level. Some of the ideas I am considering are:

* Developing a ""post-grad"" internship program. Consider it a 6 month position at below market rates for people who have graduated. After the program, the people that work out are hired at market rate for a junior. This could be open to both code camp and post-CS developers.
* Develop an internship program for people in the junior year for programs like Northwestern or Waterloo that allow for these types of semester-long internships, and then have a pathway for people who do well to have a conditional offer. (This is a more traditional path.) 

I'm looking for out of the box solutions that are fair for new developers, but don't lead to us paying for someone who can't contribute meaningfully at their salary position and then jump the moment they're just getting productive."

I really do like working with customers and have good soft skills — but my current role is very “fix it now” or “break/fix” type of stuff and it gets tiring. I enjoy more of the strategizing, designing, and consulting phases with customers… but the stress of customer service and fixing things for angry customers as end-user support is getting tiring.

I also about thinking about getting into DevOps since I am interested in Cloud, but just don’t know where to start. I wouldn't mind keeping working in Support, but getting my hands on more tools like Cloud or coding languages and exposure to more in-demand industry skills (right now I am just troubleshooting proprietary software). 

Can anyone give me some suggestions on a future career path that exposes me to tools and technologies that is “future proof”? Right now I just spend a lot of time troubleshooting proprietary software and would like to get more exposure to real-world technologies to start building my skills and open myself to more careers.

627,cscareerquestions,Why do so many newer devs come in having never used a shell or command line interface?,"I'm 12 years into my career and a heavy user of bash/shell or anything from the command line. For just about everything other than debugging tools I find it easier and faster to do it from the command line. That said, it's my preference and I know everyone has their own preference for tools!  


However it seems to me like most new developers out of college have never touched a shell and it is somewhat handicapping them. For example, I have met new developers who don't really understand what ssh, ftp or scp, thread monitoring cmds, etc. is outside of using whatever GUI tool they use to do it. I find every single time I can grep for something and get a better picture of the code structure than they can by using the IDE  inspection tools. I think just using GUIs coddles you into not knowing how to get in the dirt and find or do something yourself. At the same time, GUIs and IDEs certainly have their place and many times you can no longer get by or be as effective by just using vim or other editor. Modern IDEs with code completion and other features can you make a faster developer than just using an editor alone, certainly.  


I give an example now where I have just switched jobs and am onboarding with two other developers, both who are as senior as I am but have no shell experience. They have been waiting for people to show them how to use the tools here and walk them through everything for two weeks while I am already working in the code and getting tasks done. I already have a very good understanding of the code base here even though it is entirely new to me. I'm not smart, I just credit it to the years of practice navigating large code bases with a shell and following call stacks the old fashioned way.  


Just a thought, and I'm sorry if this sounds like boomer snobbery, I don't mean it to be. I've mentored several brand new developers and really pushed them to work in a terminal and every one of them has thanked me for it and even reached out for advice after I left.   


I guess what I want to say to new developers is, since so many of you are new, if you want to be more effective at your job, don't be afraid to use a terminal! At the very least you're also more likely to get an inward smile from your older interviewers if you mention that you like to work in vim."

629,cscareerquestions,Synchronous QA considered harmful,"We have a simple Kanban board, no sprints or story points or anything like that. A ticket moves from Backlog &gt; Todo &gt; Development &gt; Code Review &gt; QA &gt; Done/Deployed.

The process is clear and sensible until a ticket hits QA, then we throw out it out the window.

If QA finds a problem with a ticket, they immediately post a Slack thread and @ the dev, who is expected to drop whatever new thing they're working on, quickly spin up the old ticket, reproduce the issue QA is seeing, code a fix and deploy to the test environment QA is working in. The dev and QA then continue to work through any other issues with the ticket together until QA is satisfied.

Then the dev pings their original code reviewer and says ""hey can I get another thumbs-up quick, it's already passed QA"" and the reviewer is apparently supposed to auto-approve the changes.

So QA often devolves into synchronous work/multi-tasking that mangles our process for the sake of getting tickets ""over the finish line"" as quickly as possible.

I brought up my concerns with our approach in a retrospective meeting. I suggested that instead of making a Slack thread QA could note down any issues they find with a ticket and send it back to the Development column. The dev could then finish the new thing they're working on before going back to fix their old ticket. In the meantime, QA could test another ticket.

The QA manager said ""we used to do that but tickets would hang around the board forever, now we're focused on ticket velocity"" and ""you *should* drop your new ticket to get the QA one done first, it must be higher priority since you did it first, right?""

(I get the sense that these Slack threads where she and a dev ""investigate an issue together"" are what she enjoys most about her job. I find them alternately stressful and tedious.)

Am I off-base in thinking that this focus on ""ticket velocity"" is short-sighted and synchronous work should be avoided unless it's an emergency/firefight?"

In between working on my skills, applying for that 100th job, working part time and making sure I graduate with a decent gpa I can feel the stress piling up. Making a salary in contract jail for two years while being able to put relevant experience on my resume and fundamentals training sounds pretty attractive to me. 

Is there anybody out there who has experience with FDM and can give any advice?

The reason for that is that I made an example of a boss who is yelling at his employees and I strictly said that I am in no favor of that kind of behavior.

The negotiation will be over the phone, but my general plan is as follows since I am expecting them to go to the lower pay range.

""Thank you for the offer. As we've discussed during our first conversation, the pay range is from x-y so the offer is on the lower end of the band.

Is there a range temp agencies get paid on top of the hourly the employee brings home (ex: 50% on top of the pay, so $10/hr for employee = $5/hr for the agency)

Do temp agencies get a signing bonus? Any standard percentage for that?

Anyone know of how taxes, benefits are covered by a temp agency? My agency provides 1/2 of health insurance covered. I’m assuming it comes out of the amount collected on top of the employees hourly. Any other ideas on taxes?

661,cscareerquestions,Possible linkedin scam,"I am a new developer (about to start my first internship), and recently had someone reach out to me via linkedin regarding a part time non-coding development related position. They described a position in which I was to speak to clients on behalf of experienced developers who do not speak English well. The linkedin profile appeared legitimate, though I did not do any deep dives for dirt.

Initially I thought they just wanted a middleman to help with communication (I have experience with teaching English as a second language listed on my linkedin, so I thought this was why they may have reached out), but it turns out they actually wanted me to pretend to be the developer working on the project to communicate with clients, as the developers they worked with ""had trouble landing contracts because of poor english ability"".    


I told the ""recruiter"" that I would have to pass, as I was not comfortable with the dishonesty the position required. They followed up with a different offer, where I would create a developer profile that clients would reach out to to hire me for projects, but really other developers would be completing the project. Again I turned the offer down for the same reason, and they did not persist any further.  


 I couldn't tell whether the goal was to scam me (probably if I had accepted and filled out some direct deposit or payment form?) or legitimately use my voice/likeness to fool clients. Anyone else experienced anything similar or have any insight?"

My reasoning, though it is a little flawed, is that I want to use software to better the world in some shape or form.

I’m the only one from my team on-site with a CS degree, the rest are self taught/boot camp grads.

I also originally thought they didn’t work extra hours above 40, but now I’m seeing that it’s not unusual (another guy mentioned a couple weeks ago how he usually work 8 hours over the weekend, but idk if that’s personal projects or not.

My employer has informed us that we’ll be moving to the office in a few months, so I’ve been looking for a new job. However I have concerns.

Mainly, my tax situation could be tricky. At some point the Mexican government will want their cut, so it would be better to find an employer that is OK with me working from Mexico (or find employment down here).

Do any US citizens here have experience finding a US company that explicitly allows for remote work from another country?

For any Mexican citizens, how difficult is it to find a job here that allows remote work? I’ll be moving to Chiapas, so the cost of living will be very low. I’m more concerned about the freedom than I am about the pay."

In the past I’ve been applying to roles where I’ve met like 50 % max sometimes and was pretty much always successful and invited to an interview. 

So I was wondering if this „trend“ changes anything for you guys in your application process (aside from the spray-and-pray approach that’s quite common for new grads obviously), like at all.

I’m currently employed but am exploring moving to a different opportunity and had what I felt was a great phone screen with an in-house recruiter last week. She said the expectation that if they were going to move forward with me I would be hearing back from the engineering manager who would want to do a zoom call with me etc. Her tone and statements let me to believe she had a favorable impression of the conversation, even going so far as to show enthusiasm over some of my past skills and experiences, but I still haven’t heard back.

Is it common to be ghosted at this point in the screening process or do you think I would at least get the courtesy “thanks but no thanks” email? I mean, whatever led her to set up the phone screen didn’t really change just because we spoke more about those experiences over the phone, so I can’t imagine why I still wouldn’t be in the running, but it’s obviously possible."

&amp;#x200B;

Job 1: Current Role at Large Public Media Company - Been working here 2 weeks, had to accept because all my offers were expiring the same day, while waiting on 3 companies who delayed interviews

Comp: $190k, $45k equity/yr (4 years), 12% bonus

&amp;#x200B;

Since joining I've learned I'm the only senior on the team, the manager doesn't care about engineering best practices so the code is a total mess (900 line functions with inlines, entire directories of files that are just commented out, no tests, etc). Seems resistant to my suggestions thus far on best practices. This feels like it's not challenging enough technically and I'll argue with the boss a lot. I primarily took this role because of timetables to ""have something"" because it paid better than the other roles. Also due to timezones I have to start at 7 AM every day, didn't know that signing on...  


Job 2: Public Fintech - Accepted offer to start next week

Comp $180k, $130k/yr in equity

&amp;#x200B;

This company has a better future, has good perks and benefits and feels like they're technically sound from an eng side. I have engineers above me as staff level on my team and juniors under me, so I'd be kind of a middle level for the team. Work seems interesting but not anything amazing. Good enough on my resume and good potential for stability. Everything on work life balance seems good from research.  


Job 3: Slightly Controversial Public Fintech - In discussions, they delayed my interview process out to like a month after everything else wrapped  


Offer: $200k, $135k/yr in equity, $50k sign on

&amp;#x200B;

This role I'd basically be a backend lead on a team, which I don't have experience in. Wouldn't have anyone backend above me on the team but it's full stack and there's more senior on front end. I worry this role might be more than I can handle, but it's also an easy opportunity to get up to staff level if I don't screw it up. The work itself really is interesting to me. Work life balance is meh, and it's the only one of the 3 that doesn't have unlimited PTO. I'd be taking this one for the career opportunity, but it could backfire if it's ""too much"".

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to figure out which of these 3 I should take, and also how to best deal with the bridge burning part of things. I hate how it makes me feel that I'm going to have to tell one, and maybe two companies that I know I just joined but I'm headed somewhere else and I have to return my laptop and all that awkwardness (which I know in the long term is less of a big deal than I'm making it).

674,cscareerquestions,Valuing Pre-IPO equity,"I am new to the tech start-up world. The company is valued at $5b (series E).

Is that enough to get a reasonable idea of how much equity I'd get?  What more information should I ask for?

Given that this is a pretty late-stage/large start-up, do you feel that I should negotiate more on the equity piece of the comp?"
675,cscareerquestions,UX student wanting to get into CS--too little too late?,"Hi all,

I'm a rising senior Psychology major who's been pretty involved in user experience research.

Been taking CS classes and even though they're kicking my ass I really enjoy it. So if I wanted to transition into this career path, what could I do? Do I get a whole extra bachelors degree in CS? Go for a masters with what I have now? Try to refine my skills and break into industry with my current degree?

I'm feeling a bit insecure about this switch because I would consider myself to have at least a shot at some big companies for UX positions, but I feel waaaayyyyyyy behind the curve for software engineering. Feels like I should've swapped majors years ago. I know I have a bit more time and leeway than a lot of people making career swaps after undergrad, so I want to know if there are options I'm unaware of.

 I have been appalled by how horrible their internal processes are. Their Product team seems to have absolutely no idea of their business goals and seems totally disconnected from their development teams. Their development teams seem wholly incompetent and lack the fundamental understanding of what is required for a software integration.

These are just some basic examples based on my interactions, but it seems insane how a company like this has been able to succeed and grow with such incompetence. It's like we were paired with the ""stupid"" kids on a school project.

I previously worked at an extremely large company, and I was nothing but impressed by the intelligence of my peers and the standards of our internal processes. I wrongly assumed every large and successful company would be similar.

I'm a 2021 electronics grad who didn't write a single line of code 6 months before job fairs nor made any web dev project but destiny and my proactiveness took me to 2 brilliant electronic based internships in Siemens AG and my current company (let's say X because I don't want to disclose.. But it's like top tier PBC and perhaps most respected in US). Now 6 months Into internship we 15 interns..(in different tech non tech team, software, no sw) found ourselves at situation where only 2 positions where open in the entire company for interns and say it my luck or my tremendous hard work.. I cleared the interview and got one of the 2 position that too in the best software engineering team the conglomerate has. Why I say lucky is becoz as I said 6 months before I never wrote a line of code neither did dsa and still got a top job. 

But when  I started working as dev I got tech stack which was very unpopular and no courses for it.. So not very friendly tech stack for someone who is beginner.. But some how I did pick it up(enough to complete user story and debug to defect). Now 3 months into the job I went to LinkedIn to add my skill but found LinkedIn doesn't recognise my open source js library as tech stack.. 
Im 7 months into job working on same tech stack. To add to difficulties my senior left and now I'm 2nd senior most dev in FE with only 7 months experience and only a documentation to take help from which is useless.. No video no stack overflow support. My question is what should I do..? I firmly believe my experience in the current tech stack will never find me a next job as no one knows or works on it. I thought I will do dsa but I just don't have the consistency. I sit to work at 930am..get up at 9pm..and post that I'm literally a dead body. I thought I will switch when no longer they ask code but have fear even then no one will take me coz I don't have work experience in any other tech stack. Please guide me on what should I do.. I'm in a company great for my resume.. Recruiters approach me often but in interviews again when I mention tech stack they are totally unaware ans don't value it. If I have to switch I will start from sde1 again(not an issue) but as I said I don't have dsa skills for neighboring Faangs neither have time. Please guide me my future looks dark."

Probably they did it to make the salary competitive and prevent their employee from moving somewhere with higher pay, which means probably i was underpaid, but for me it seems unlikely that an employer would be that generous to increase someone's pay that much. or they accidentally put an extra ""0"" on my increase percentage.

i don't think it's an impostor syndrome, but from seeing the average performance review result and the fact i didn't get a promotion, i was surprised that they would give that high of a pay rise."

694,cscareerquestions,Career switch to CS related field starting form scratch with low undergrad GPA. Looking for guidance on Postbacc or 2nd undergrad degree,"Hello, I’m just seeking some opinions from others who have more knowledge than I do..and who could provide some guidance of a guy who wants to start over…

I have an undergrad degree in something useless, with a low GPA, and I’m ready to do something else with my life. I’ve been out of school for about 10 years. Work full time. No kids, no spouse, no real obligations. No debt.

My low undergrad GPA (~2.2 I cannot remember) is discouraging. I had lots of personal issues I was dealing with (my last parent died) and I didn’t really care about school. I was getting paid to go (GI bill)..so I was surviving just to earn the piece of paper..

Fast forward until now. I have a job that will pay $5k per year as a reimbursement towards education. My low GPA makes me think I will have to take courses prior to submitting my application to show I’m competent (not an issue, I am in no rush)..

I have competed some of CS50 and liked it. I have completed half of some Udemy courses.. and I have built my own PC (fun, but probably not much to this sub) just by reading.. it was an accomplishment to me. 


I say the above to paint a picture of the situation I am in. To receive better guidance from those in this sub knowledgeable.

My options I’ve considered: Auburn, OSU, and Purdue (full bachelors in my state, not ideal), and university of boulder.


I plan to stay with my job for another 3 years, as I will be “vested” then.. also, since they’re paying $5k per year, it makes the most sense to not rush the degree, receive better grades (more time to study), and actually learn things.. I understand the counter argument too: rush in like a madman, make CS my focus, then reap the rewards sooner..I’m not that certain though.


If you were me, what options would you consider? Not sure if it matters, but I live in Indiana. I haven’t read about any intriguing CS programs here."

700,cscareerquestions,Is The Odin Project relevant for an about to be CS graduate?,"Hey everyone,

In the last couple months I have been trying to assess what I have learned in the last 3 years and where I am in terms of getting an entry level job in Software development/engineering. I come to the conclusion that my degree covered a lot of theory but unsure whether it has prepared me for a career. I have applied for a few internships but struggling to hear back... I know this is a common issue with CS graduates so that's why I'm wondering what I can actively do to get into software engineering.

I've learned bits of everything at university: data structures and algorithms, OOP, data analysis, cloud technologies, even project management and conceptual modelling, etc. but tbh don't really know how it all connects in the real world and I also know that I am lacking knowledge on a bunch of things. I haven't mastered a programming language either (python's been my go to but I still have so much to learn). The workload has been heavy and as I also work pretty much full time, I haven't had the time to learn git and participate in projects - this means I have been exposed to a lot of information but I have no actual experience.

I've heard about free sources like The Odin Project which offers a full stack curriculum. It seems to make sense out of everything and it teaches how to contribute to real projects, which sounds very appealing.

However, there are two things about this course for me: 

Firstly, I am unsure as to whether I want to dive deep into front-end (although it says full stack, it seems to focus a lot more on JS, CSS and HTML), as I found myself enjoying the logic behind backend more in my degree (yes I know JS can also be used in backend with Node.js). I also found this:

github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-univwrsity

This seems to have a similar sort of content as my CS degree (albeit more in depth and with further resources) but they do not cover any front-end, which I think any software engineer needs. It could also be overkill, since the fundamentals behind Big-O, algorithms and data structures have already been covered in my course (I could simply refresh/refine my knowledge in these areas if needed).

The other thing is whether completing The Odin Project, which seems to cater for self taught developers, is a good decision for a CS graduate who wants to get into the job market (I'd hate to get stuck in tutorial hell).

I have a lot of questions and doubts and sadly my University is not that great at providing guidance on this. If anyone could give me some advice based on their experience I would really really appreciate it. The amount of information out there and different resources can be very overwhelming.

Thanks a lot."
701,cscareerquestions,"Recently graduated, looking for career advice.","I recently graduated with a BSCS from Western Governor's University.  Currently working in IT at roughly 45k per year at a small company trying to depart to become a software developer.  The company I work at does not have any software development opportunities or necessities; they buy off-the-shelf software solutions that are deeply integrated.  Some background information:

1. I live in a rural area.  When I say rural, the area at one time was home to coal mining, manufacturing, resource extraction.  This means that very few businesses, if any, are looking for a programmer locally.
2. WGU is not an ivy-league school, but it is regionally and nationally accredited.
3. I have a GitHub with my college programming assignments, but nothing more

Basically, my thought process is to find a remote entry level position to gain experience.  From what I have seen, experience and knowledge is paramount to landing better positions in the future.  It looks like 3-5 years of experience is the standard for 6 figure incomes in most cases.  Entry level pay is around $50k for most positions.

I started applying on Indeed to several remote entry level positions last night.  I have known friends who utilize recruiting firms from larger cities to match employers with employees, but these were strictly local positions with no remote work.  I guess I am curious if there are any recruiting firms that specialize in placing CS grads into remote positions, entry level.  I am friends with a few recruiters on LinkedIn, but they are basically looking for seasoned programmers.

Are there any other recommendations you can think of that I should be doing?  Does anyone know of any remote recruiting companies or opportunities aside from the mainstream Indeed/LinkedIn websites?  Thanks in advance!"

Hello,

I just need some help deciding what to do. Okay my situation.

I am in my late 20s and have a bachelors degree in liberal arts and sciences so suffice to say I have no computer science experience regarding programming, web developing, cyber security, ai ,or software engineering among many other jobs. I am single, working a job I really dont like making above the median here in the US but nothing amazing. I want to change my field and go into computer science. I have always liked computers, tech, and the advancements we are making. My experience with computers is basically I have built several over the years for gaming purposes mainly. Maintenance, cleaning, and switching parts is something i generally really enjoy doing. I have always been the tech person that friends and family come to when they need help with there computers, phones, tvs, etc. My problem is should i purpose a masters in computer science or another bachelors in computer science. Regarding computer science I dont really know what field to specialize in. I want a job that pays handsomely and im just being honest here. I have looked into degrees that can be obtain fully online from programs such as snhu or Purdue university global but those programs reputations are making me very indecisive regarding what to do. Regarding taking classes on campus, its really not an option for me at this time. I dont know if i should even get a masters in computer science and instead specialize in something for a masters. I am leaning towards a masters in computer science tho to hopefully get an understand of all the specialties available for someone in this field because I don't really know that specialty would be for me. Im just suck and I dont know what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

707,cscareerquestions,25% Raise and 50% Raise on top of that to change companies,"I recently got a raise from 80k to 100k at my current company and just got a 10k bonus and 10k equity. 

I have been interviewing and kist got an offer for a contract position at a company called F*rd. The offer is 145k/yr with the same PTO and decent benefits.

The only problem is it’s a contract position, and I feel like it may not be stable and when the economy slows down it just puts target on my head as an expensive contractor. (i.e. quickest way to cut costs is to fire the most expensive contractor)

The project that Im working on may be able to survive a manufacturing downturn as it provides a separate income stream.

I have interviews at a FAANG coming up, but my recruiter has essentially been ghosting me so all i have is an interview date. That’s two weeks from now. 


;TLDR 

Take a contract position for 50% raise, but may be less stable, or stay at stable position at current company? (I really dont think they could fire our team as we work on the core services of the organization). I’d really like to get into this FAANG, but my leetcode fame is the best.

My short term goals is to save for a house, but my long term goals is to be in major tech. This salary bump would allow me to bankroll cash.

710,cscareerquestions,Tips on what I might be doing wrong.,"I am in my early-mid 30s and decided on a career change about 4 years ago. Went back to school, got a CS degree and graduated last May.   I have wife and children, and working full time while in school is pretty stressful as you can imagine, so after I graduated I took the last half of the year ""off"" and just enjoyed the summer and a few much needed vacations. I started at my current place as a pharmacy technician, and as the store grew, my role sort of morphed into the more IT related role it is now.  I have been employed with the same place since 2010, and the pay is great, so I decided that delaying a new job search until January wasn't that big of a deal.  

Here is the problem:  I have been applying to entry level SWE/SD roles all over since January (200+) and so far have only landed 2 interviews, and was rejected for both.  One was a small embedded systems shop that had me do 3 interviews, one behavioral, one tech, and one with CEO.  The other was a sub contractor for LM that consisted of a 1 hour 1on1 with a senior.  I don't think I bombed any of the interviews, since most of the technical questions were simple OOP concept questions, explain stack vs queue, etc.  I am worried that something about my resume might be the issue.  

A few things I want to point out:

1.  I have only been applying to local/remote positions.  I have a family and I can't afford to relocate for a new job at this point in my life.  I know this limits some of my chances, but uprooting my family just isn't an option.

2.  Of the 200+ applications I have sent, a solid amount were for remote positions.  Just looking at the number of applicants on various job boards shows that there are usually 2-3 **THOUSAND** applicants for these positions, so I feel like these are just a waste of time.

3.  I am mainly using Indeed, LinkedIn, DICE, and some other smattering of job boards to look for opportunities.  The interview I landed for the defense contractor I got from a recruiter finding me on DICE.  

4.  My Job title is still technically ""Pharmacy Technician"" which is what shows on my LinkedIn, should I change this?


I think what is causing me to begin worrying is the fact that I thought I did well, but was still turned down.  I read a lot here and glassdoor about defense contractors not being particularly hard jobs to land, so now I am thinking if I can't even get in there, how will I get in anywhere else.  I mean I have sent applications to all the major defense contractors (Raytheon, LM, Boeing) and they always just sit in the ""Applied"" or ""Resume under review"" stages.  The recruiter for the place that turned me down actually said in the rejection email to ""try LM, they usually have entry level positions.""

Like I said though, I am not really desperate at the moment, and I can afford to wait as long as it takes, I am just getting concerned.  I know its a bloodbath out there.

711,cscareerquestions,Quit my job,"Background:
I graduated in Biotech from a tier 1 college in India. However, I always loved programming and did CS courses and did projects and internships. My campus placements was sort of mediocre and I didn't really get an SDE job. I got a business systems analyst job. I didn't like it, but still thought of giving it a shot.

Joined the job. The job was very beauracratic and boring, but managers and work environment and work life balance was good. But recently they started the hybrid mode so I was called to office. I hated this. And I also started getting more work. Mostly beauracratic work, since it's a bank. The tech team in banks are mostly mediocre. The work I do here was not helping my resume either, because the work was not development.

My initial plan was to find a job first then quit. But the job became so unbearable that I quit first. I have 3 months notice period. I don't know if this was the right choice. I have give Amazon's test, and I am hoping they call for interview. But am still not sure if I'll clear it.

I have mot much applications anywhere. I guess I have to start applying and start doing leetcode and probably a project to fill my resume. I still have doubts about if my decision was wrong. What's the point of adding beauracratic/managerial work if my intent was becoming an SDE? Do you guys think it was dumb of me to quit? The pay was good enough for Indian salaries.

I know programming in Python and have done almost 5 years of programming in it. I have experience in web dev. in Flask. But for the last one year I don't have any work ex to show. How do I apply for other companies? Could I possibly get SDE jobs at startups if I don't get through Amazon? I habe done the DSA course at my uni and my basics are good, I just meed some revision. I did partly do leetcode during my job.

719,cscareerquestions,Advice on Work/Life Balance at WITCHR Company,"I just started working (4th week) at one of the witch companies on a fang project (contract), im having some issues that I need advice on. I am getting paid hourly and based on my contract my work hours are 9-5 est. The issue is, we have three different places where people work from. PST, CT and IST(india). 

The IST team has been giving me onboarding which requires me to wake up at 6 AM. According to my hours, my work day should end at 2 pm(8 hours). but my manager whose in CT expects me to join his onboarding at 5 PM EST. And then the client whose in PST expects me to join meetings ranging from 7pm est - 12 am est. It makes no sense to me. So they want me to be on call the whole day??

My manger makes it seem like I should be open to working all hours. But I have other responsibilities that I have to take care of. I can NOT be in front of my computer from 6 am to 5 pm and waiting for their random meetings that they setup last minute for me to join.

I am planning on talking to my manager(mentor) on Monday and I need advice. I have three options. Either I work with the offshore team from 6 am to 2 pm est....or work 10 am to 6 pm (managers time) or i work 6 am - 6 pm but I will clock in those hours and need to get paid over time.

I feel like because I am in onboarding and I am new, they are taking advantage of me. I understand my managers and others might like to work 8+ hours but I have no incentive to do that. I work to live not the other way around.

I am severely underpaid, the higher ups are rushing me to learn all their 15 different tools that they use in less then a month...when i barely get any onboarding training from anyone (everyone is busy). My mentor was instructed to onboard me but I get at most an hour of onboarding every days and most of that has been used to set up my machine. There is no onboarding documentations. So I am not learning anything specific about their tools at all.

Theres also no management communication. I have three different managers at different levels, they all have different expectations from me. They highest manager expects me to start taking half of my mentors tickets by next week, when this is my first job as this role and no one has given me proper onboarding.

I just got my first ticket on Friday and I don't even have access to one of their tools that is required to finish that ticket. Its so frustrating. I was told to work with the offshore team... So does that mean from 6 am - 2 pm.

Anyway thanks for reading. Advice would be appreciated."
720,cscareerquestions,Almost/Soon to force to be fired at a startup. What should I do?,"I joined the startup 5 months ago with no experience (no internship) before. The pay is great, the tech stack is good (even though I had a really hard time to learn erlang and Haskell since I never done functional programming before) and I did enjoy learning a lot from other devs here. The company looks promising and definitely has a bright future.

However, I never received any training nor having a mentor to help me. I kept making some stupid mistakes due to lack of experience such as failing to write a comprehensive test, bad coding style (duplicate code, unnecessary comments/logs, inefficient use of data structure, etc), but mostly I failed to finish tasks on time. 

About one month ago, my supervisor told me that the upper levels were not happy about my performance that some tasks were hanging much longer than expected. So we discussed some plans on how to increase my production in a given time period. For instance, having a 1-1 meetings regularly with one of the other dev in our team (but we are in a completely different time zone. I’ll explain the structure of our team later..). (I think it’s kind of being in PIP, but we didn’t have any evaluation form)

Fast forward, last Friday, I was asked to go to his office to have a 1-1 meeting, and he said that after these time, he felt I was not productive enough. He gave some examples of other devs (who were new grads at that time) that they accomplished a big project in a few months after joining the company while I clearly had nothing in comparison. I even got questioned about being slack-off (since most of the time I’m still working remotely), but in fact I always worked more than 8 hours per day since I know I’m slow and I should spend more time to get things done. He concluded that I am likely not ready to fit in this fast paced working environment based on my current ability. He asked me to think about whether I should stay in our company (I also admitted to him that I have been stressed out and burnt out lately in that meeting). He said he will give me one month notice or something (i almost collapsed at that time. I’m not sure he said one month PIP or one month notice period)

I thought back myself after the meeting. I understand and acknowledge that I did a really bad job in communications. There are only 4 devs in our team, and besides my supervisor, the other 2 are located in Asia with a different time zone. In the beginning of my job, I always asked questions to my supervisor, but he was always busy. So he asked me to ask one of the other devs for help. Thus, I have a bad habit that I always asked my coworker for helps instead of him.  When we are doing code review, my build always needs changes (most of the time I have to rewrite parts of the code since my supervisor always gave me suggestions on how to improve the quality of my code), and that brings down the speed of the code production. 

I don’t know what to do now. Honestly, I totally agree that I’m a bad fit for them, and I should definitely start looking for the next job now. However, I totally don’t know what to reply them now. I feel like it would be bad if I told them I want to stay because I feel untrusted and have no way to suddenly perform well enough to survive another month (I’m totally stressed out now and having insomnia recently) which could possibly lead to me be actually fired. But if I gave my 2 weeks notice to them now that means I’ll only have 2 weeks to find a job in order to not having an unemployment gap, but I haven’t practiced leetcode for awhile. Also, I don’t know what to say to the recruiters in the future when they have questions about me leaving the company after staying for only 5 months. 

Any suggestions or even some career advices would be appreciated!"

I have been the solo developer for a fully remote company for a little over 8 years (not a tech company which is why there isn't a large tech team). I absolutely love the company and my co-workers and because I have been the sole developer, I have great job security and have complete control over the tech stack. As sad as it sounds, the systems I have built feel like my children because how much I have been in charge of them and how much control I've had as far as steering our online systems. But I have real children and a family to keep in mind so if I have to leave, it’s not a controlling factor. 

I have always been underpaid but the perks of the job always outweighed it for me - 100% remote, great work/life balance, etc. Then COVID hit, my wifes work slowed way down, things got really hard, and me being underpaid for my skill set really began to hurt. After 8 years, I made just over 60k last year... From what I've heard that is relatively average for our company but I am the only developer so their skill sets are completely different and only about 50% are US based (including me).

I manage our entire AWS infrastructure (most things are on ECS), built out our Terraform automation to allow us to grow, and handle Salesforce Apex when we need it as well. Basically, I wear a lot of hats and because our business requirements need to be flexible to sell to a wide range of clients or partners, I have continually learned anything and everything I can to better know the best tool for the job when it comes up (within reason of course) and wrote libraries/tools that make me better/faster at what I do. All this includes most of the industry standard type stuff like good unit testing, CI/CD pipelines, implementing and following code style guides, etc. On top of all that, I deliver what I need to and don't really get negative feedback on anything I build outside of minor tweaks and bug reports. A lot more praise than negative feedback. Additionally, when everyone on the team was getting hours cut because of COVID’s impact on our industry, I was the only full time employee because they knew I was essential. 

I could rattle off more ""skills"" but the rest are more ""used for a short time as a proof of concept"" type skills that I don't think carry as much weight outside of showing that I truly love learning and experimenting with new tech.

But at the end of the day, I have to do whats best for me and my family. I'm working on a big launch right now that should wrap in a few weeks and after that, I'm planning to talk to management about either needing a very sizable raise or needing to look for another jobs. If I can get over $130k/year with assurance that I wont be frozen at that rate, I'll feel a lot better. I know thats still underpaid but I need good work/life balance and job security. Also, the direction I think we are going in (our recent board member/biggest investor comes from the tech industry) may help down the road and I'm sure he will be brought in on this conversation before they give a formal no.

My biggest fear is overplaying my hand. They would have an extremely hard time replacing me so I have leverage there but I have no formal CS education (Associates in an unrelated field from a Junior College) and not a ton of experience working in a team of developers (though I try to handle everything with a team in mind) so I'm a little anxious about moving from a non-tech company to a more tech driven company because I feel those will be a lot more important.

Sorry if this is rambling but I'm trying to go into this conversation as prepared as possible and know before hand how much I am actually worth if I were to leave (both cost to replace me and what I can get elsewhere) as well as knowing if my experience is enough to outweigh lack of formal education and inexperience working on a large dev team.

Thanks in advance."

I've been a java developer for three years now and most of the relevant jobs I can apply for require me to either be proficient in .net core or node.js. How likely is it to pitch your skills (different domain knowledge and coding principles that still apply) in the right manner and land a job if you've had previous experience writing in these technologies - but your experience is very ""dated"". Some friends tell me I should not be worried about this at all while others tell me I should instead go for java positions that require more experience (5+ years) and do my best there."

746,cscareerquestions,Apprenticeship vs Degree Apprenticeship,"Hi, I desperately need advice, I live in the UK.

I absolutely want to do a career in software development and I am unsure what route to take.

I can (hopefully) do a degree apprenticeship, with the degree being in ""Digital and Technology Solutions BSc "" (closest to Computer Science degree), it is usually 3 to 4 years and after completing the degree apprenticeship, I'll have a degree as well as 3/4 years of experience in the field. The university will be a non Russel group one. How valuable is the 3/4 years of experience and the degree, is it seen as ""less"" than a standard Junior role's years of experience in the eyes of an employer? And is the degree seen as worse than a BSc in Computer Science?

A second route I can take is to do a 2 year Apprenticeship in Software Engineering. After the 2 years, I'll hopefully apply for a full time position as a software engineer. Is that going to be difficult since I don't have a degree? Is the 2 years of experience worth ""less"" than 2 years as a Junior Software Engineer?

Any advice would be very appreciated."

""Hi,

I already have a bachelor’s degree in a nontechnical field, but I’m planning to switch career paths from that field to CS/software engineering. To make up for the background I don’t currently have, I’ll be taking a Computer Science BS curriculum over the next 3-4 semesters, starting from the beginning, and including all the prerequisites (math, etc).  My goal is to build up my fundamentals in CS and then eventually apply for a masters program in CS or software engineering. 

These courses start in the fall, so I have some time before then. My question is, what is the best use of my time to prepare for a CS education and software engineering career path before classes start? 

Would it be a good idea to take intro courses on sites like Udemy or Coursera? 

Should I come up with a kind of practice “portfolio project” so that I have a goal to work towards while developing my programming and software engineering skills?

What programming languages are best to self-teach that will build good habits and be useful in a broad range of CS career tracks? For example, is it fine to start with Java, or should I really focus on something like C++ instead? I’m not sure yet but I think I am more interested in backend software work.""

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Particularly if there is anyone out there who has switched into CS from a nontechnical field successfully.

Thanks!"

Am I crazy?,"I joined my current company under 2 months ago as an entry-level dev, but in that time I have accustomed myself to the codebase to the point where I am able to implement new features without supervision. I also have been able to find bugs in parts of the code that haven't been touched in over 10 years with poor documentation, and find solutions that address the issues without casing a major rework of the codebase.

Currently, I realize I am being paid about 10-15% less than competitors in my area for entry-level and the discrepancy increases if you consider that I'm practically able to do senior-level tasks. Am I crazy to ask for a salary increase so soon? And if not, how to approach it? I have also been getting messages from recruiters for senior-level positions, although I'm not certain if I will pass the interviews.

It was an Indian recruiter who found my resume and it turned out to be legit. I worked a 2 month 5-10 hour per week contract which I also didn’t apply for they found my resume and it turned out to be legit.

I said ‘what if they don’t know how to code’ he said ‘we hire graduates that don’t know how to code all the time.’ I said ‘so what do they do’ he said ‘they learn.’

I have a question about interviewing at FAANG-level companies. I have many years of experience, primarily on the backend. Unfortunately, I don't have experience with microservices and other things like messaging queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc). I've mostly worked with monolith applications. Would this be a deal-breaker for me? Or would being able to understand them within the context of system design interviews be sufficient? I have no issue with being down-leveled, and I assume it'd happen since I've not worked at those types of companies before.

I've been studying more LeetCode-style questions, but I've been debating spending more time on that vs doing more practical self-study (AWS certifications, microservice and message queue projects on my own time to learn). It kind of feels like the answer really depends on what types of companies I want to target.

I've purchased ""Designing Data Intensive Applications"" and ""Web Scalability for Startup Engineers,"" and I'm considering signing up for Grokking the System Design Interview later after I've worked through more LeetCode.

I have a friend who is at a FAANG company, but he's not in web application development. He feels like I'm overcomplicating things.

A simple google search reveals that icims is a company that seems to want you to sent your personal info to them for recruitment purposes? it seems this clever attempt to get me to give this shady company icims my personal info? Is this necessary to move forward in the recruitment process?

Thanks for your help."

I definitely wanted to do this sooner but I was waiting for a promotion/title (not sure if that was a good idea). Promotions have been announced, so I now have that title. I have been in consulting for 4 years. I have about 2.5 years of professional experience in software development . My current client role is IT support, which I’m not happy with at all. I have already tried discussing concerns multiple times with HR and management but no luck with any change. This will be my first switch, since I’ve been with this company out of college . I’m a little overwhelmed and not sure where to start. I understand I do need to sharpen up skills and prepare for interviews. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance."

826,cscareerquestions,Is it normal for companies not to give an offer because my graduation date has extended by 6 months ?,"A bit background : I am international  masters in CS student in a UC currently in my second year . 

So I interviewed for this company X back in beginning Novermber 2021 for a full time role .At that time my expected graduation date was in June 2022. There were two rounds of interviews . In one of the rounds the interviewing did not realise he was screen sharing and started googling the answers to the questions he was asking me . This was towards the latter timeline of the interview . Nevertheless I thought I did well .


Afterwards I did not hear back from this company for almost 4 months thinking I got rejected . They reach out to me today asking what my expected graduation date and I told them I m expecting to graduate in Dec 2022. They said that they cannot extend me an offer because I am graduating in Dec 2022 not in June 2022 although I am not sure but I vividly remember in application that I mentioned my expected graduation date.

I mentioned to the recruiter that I might be able to graduate in June but cannot be certain of it . They said they cannot extend the offer . Also the position is something that I dont exactly enjoy doing but would do it anyways

I dont know of it is a normal behaviour for a firm to not extend an offer if their potential employee could have a later graduation date . It is the first time this has happened to me .

In hindsight I feel I could have said I graduate in June and let them know at that time I might need extension. But they called out of the blue and I couldnt think atm.

Anyways any feedback is appreciated about if this normal is tech industry or how I could have handled it"
827,cscareerquestions,Behavioral Question Expectation for top level company,"Hi,

I am an SDE whose experience is mostly on Java backend (Spring), react and Node. I just want to ask, what are the expectation of answers to behavioral questions in companies like Amazon or Microsoft or FB. Because I don't know if merely Java backend experience I will be able to come up with interesting enough stories to impress interviewers. I have saw that those who pass faang interviews usually had experience like distributed system, message queue system architecture and microservice ect. I mean I can learn those on my own, but I just don't have any chance to touch those at my work, and personal learnings and projects seems not valued by non-internship role, especially at top firms.

837,cscareerquestions,A question for all CS people - personality,"Have you ever realized you can code but then felt like this is not what I want to be. Like I got a job coding some small subsection of this feature of this site, and it does not feel like enough?

I spent almost 6 years in school doing code. Maybe I did not know what I wanted yet (and still dont). Maybe we expect people to know that too early, but thats a different story. I am only 24, but I am troubled by this thought and am wondering if other people have arrived at this conclusion or thought as well.

Almost like: I do not hate coding and I am not bad at it but something inherent to programming doesn't fit my personality or dreams? I know people say there are ""engineering types"". Task oriented, driven, capable of pushing through dry work/documentation/testing, micro instead of macro oriented. Are you all engineering types? If you aren't and have to hit the anvil over and over coding and coding, how do you cope with that?"
838,cscareerquestions,Chase $ or Passion/interest? Warning: long post,"This is probably more of a ""only you can answer that question"" but would still appreciate anyone's opinion! 

Currently a senior software dev at a startup. I get everything done timely and better than most of the other devs (sorry, just trying to paint the full picture) but:

\- I'm really over startup culture for various reasons like

\- ""shout out to this team/person for working extra hours!"" without any actual rewards

\- one loud customer somehow creates an entire project for us to work on

\- new features &gt; improving health of codebase. Always.

\- jumping from project A to B without finishing A

\- lack of skill/experience amongst the average developer

\- constant fire fighting due to the tech debt introduced over years for above reasons

\- contrived culture, e.g. daily standups that no one pays attention in; talking about going away from   
old bad habits but never do

\- I couldn't care less about the product / vision. To me, it's just a CRUD app with a more complicated-than-helpful architecture. 

\- Feel like I could be doing more. 

\- Also feel like I don't get paid enough for everything I do, especially after reading fellow Redditors talking about how 200-300K is easy nowadays ;) 

All of this sort of made my last 4 years in the same # of startups mentally taxing. I find myself saying ""oh F off teammate A"" for, to be honest, doing their jobs (e.g. QA), and everyday it's very difficult to get myself motivated to do any work; I work with not-so-talented devs, so my coasting is at least as efficient as other devs' efforts. This apathy for and even irritability with work is weighing heavier everyday and I find it difficult to not let it spew out into my everyday life.

I also have a big interest in life outside of work. My family is growing, we want to move and upgrade our house (ideally keep this one to rent out), my hobbies are expensive, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for reading this far.

&amp;#x200B;

Given all this, I'm definitely going to be finding a new gig here soon. I'm now wondering whether I should take the time to find something I care about or just chase the money so everything else in my life is as good as it could be.  

To be frank, I have doubts of whether or not whatever topic I end up in would make a difference in the \~8 hours I'm working. I really want it to, I just know I'd rather go golf or bike lol. Who knows until I try it though, right?

I also could see ok I'm making 300K, we got a new house, I got a shiny new bike, great. Then what? I probably will still be mentally apathetic and irritable during work...

Have you experienced similar situations? Ever find a way out?"

840,cscareerquestions,I feel inadequate at work and guilty after getting promoted to Junior," Hi guys,

  I'm looking for advice how to get over feeling so inexperienced and constantly having to ask for help.  I'm currently working at a company as a Junior developer. I recently got promoted to junior from Graduate developer about 2 weeks ago. I've also worked at the company on an internship, in the past, during my 3rd year of university and somehow I managed to received a graduate offer. Prior to this promotion, I worked as a graduate for 6 months now and unexpectedly got promoted so soon. Although I'm very happy that I got this promotion, I feel like I don't deserve it.  Normally, I would pick up a work item/ticket and get the job done really fast with very rare mishaps. Everything was good, I was happy and I got the job done on-time. But recently, my team leader personally assigned me to a task I was very unfamiliar with. He said it would be a pretty good challenge for myself and to work on something I'm not used to working with normally.

 And early-on, while working on this new requirement/feature, he gave me that promotion. Working on that requirement, I was just so lost. I misunderstood the requirement description, I constantly called my seniors and asked for help. I felt so bad annoying them constantly. Everyday, I would ask for a call and ask for help with the requirement assigned to me. In the past, I rarely ever did so. If I did, it would be a simple short 5 minute call. Now I'm taking 30 minutes to 1 hour of their time.  My Pull Requests are filled with comments after comments for refactoring from my team lead. I've got so many questions to ask but always so afraid to ask them because I didn't want to waste their time as they have more important things to be doing. 

Sometimes, my lead would have go into my branch and update the code themselves. I felt like he was getting increasingly more agitated and I get it too. They shouldn't have to reiterate something more than once for me to understand.  I get stuck in a dilemma where I want to show that I can work independently and make code changes myself but every time I commit my changes, my team lead asked why I even made that change as it wasn't even necessary or the incorrect way. But also, not wanting to constantly ask questions every second and take so much of their time.

 My team lead's a great person and always ensures the work is done to a good standard. He's always so nice to me. I'm very thankful he gave me a job offer. But these past few weeks on that new requirement, I just know he felt annoyed at my work. I just don't want to disappoint them and am trying my best to grow, and make sure I don't make these mistakes again. I keep thinking to myself ""I don't deserve the promotion, I was fine as a graduate. I didn't mind at all"".  Has anyone been in this situation before? Please, can you offer some advice on how to get over this feeling? Maybe I'm just ranting at myself. Any advice would be greatly appreciated"
841,cscareerquestions,Post Bacc or OMSCS?,"I'm a self-taught SWE and I've been working for 5 years now. I enjoy the work but I've been wanting to pursue a CS degree because I took some courses at a community college and I'm really enjoying them. I'm not so much driven by I want X career after finishing so much as exploring the possibility of transitioning to teaching or going into academia or just finishing and continuing to work. I just never enjoyed school and now I'm actually enjoying every bit of it. Just considering my current stage in life (30, unmarried, no children), I want to go to school while working.

For my background

\- Currently at senior level managing a team of 4 devs

\- Have full support (letters of recc) of technical leaders and co-workers (VPs, CTO, staff level, etc)

\- Taken advanced DS&amp;A, computer architecture, discrete math

My dilemma is that I had a very poor undergraduate GPA (2.8; chemistry) and it really feels near impossible to get into the programs I'm interested in (UIUC, UTA, GT). Post Bacc seems to be an option (UC Boulder, O(regon)SU because I feel confident I could do well enough to gain admission to my top schools. The downside is that I would be paying a lot, taking more time, and essentially re-taking some courses I've already taken.

Has anyone gotten into those programs with similar background? Does Post Bacc seem to be the only way to get noticed for me? Are there other programs I haven't listed here worth looking into?"

845,cscareerquestions,New grad: Is it a bad idea to choose an early-stage startup over a F500?,"I have two offers and I'm so, so conflicted about which to choose. Both really want me and negotiated with me despite being a new grad, and I seem like I'd fit in either team.

*Startup pros:*

- Local, so I don't have to relocate (and can stay with my parents until I pay off student loans/build up savings)

- Same salary

- Doing work that I'm most passionate about (NLP/data science)

- Good fit with the team

- Flexibility in terms of switching between different teams

- I have a voice in the direction of the company and in the features that I choose to work on

- Has F500 companies as clients already

*Startup cons:*

- Seed-stage (15-20 people), so naturally risky

- Doesn't have any brand power on resume

- Less structure, so I won't be learning the established DevOps processes etc. that exist at large companies

- No bonus or equity

*F500 pros:*

- Better networking since there's so many people

- Has sign-on bonus, relocation, and equity

- Established but also growing, lots of tech expansion and clean up

- The leads I spoke with were really nice and competent and seemed like they foster a good team environment

- The team I'm joining is in the process of changing a lot of their tech and processes so it won't be boring legacy stuff

- New city, new experiences

- Stands out more on a resume or when talking to people

- I have no internships or other experience, so having a big name would make me look more qualified

- Possibly easier to get into Big-N down the line?

*F500 cons:*

- I was assigned as an SRE and while they're transitioning to the legit kind of SRE, I have little idea what it'd be like to work in that role

- SRE seems very specialized in a direction I wasn't really expecting

- Rotating on-call

- I have anxiety and the firefighting stuff seems like it'd stress me out

- The company has a reputation for bad WLB

- The city is very expensive and rent erases the pay difference

- Away from friends and family


TL;DR After writing this out, I've realized that my concerns for the startup are mainly due to it being a startup, whereas my concerns for the F500 are about what it'd actually be like working there. I'd say the biggest thing making it hard to choose the startup is that I feel like the F500 will look better for future jobs and I have no clue whether the startup will succeed. Thoughts?"
846,cscareerquestions,Is it worth quitting a full-time job and going into teaching? What are the main struggles teachers are facing at the moment?,"Hello everybody!

&amp;#x200B;

I've graduated from college about 3 years ago and was lucky enough to get decent, and I would even say a well-paid job. I quickly made a career at the company I was working for at the time. I went from intern to department manager in a year. I know it sounds too good to be true, but I guess I was lucky if you don't take into account all the sleepless nights I've spent studying at the college library.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I've reached a point where I want to quit my current job because it makes me miserable and lonely. I often have to stay in the office till midnight to finish the job for the day so that guys in my team can go home on time. They have families, and I'm the only one single. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm now thinking of doing something that will be useful for other people and me as well. Back in college, I used to work as a tutor. I like working with people and being helpful. I was so proud when struggling first-year students in college could pass their exams with my help. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I realize how much I miss teaching. Every time we have a newbie on board, I feel enthusiastic about explaining our work. I want to quit my current and apply for a Ph.D. program. I'd love to teach in college one day. I'm confident it will make me happy. Right now, I'm reading tons of resources for teachers, like [https://start-teaching.com/](https://start-teaching.com/). The more I get into it, the more I realize that I should've gone into teaching in the first place.

I'd like to ask about the main struggles of being a teacher, be it high school or college. I feel like I currently see teaching through pink glasses, which is why learning about the problems associated with this noble profession may give me a more realistic notion.

Thanks in advance to anyone willing to give me some pointers."

850,cscareerquestions,Is it too early to ask for more equity?,"I joined an early stage startup as the first employee 4 months ago. The startup had at the time 3 cofounders, one of which is an engineer, and had just raised a nice seed round before I joined. We now have 3 additional employees and myself, making for 4 employees and 3 cofounders. I received 1% and had 3 years experience, mostly at a FAANG-adjacent large company.

Not to brag, but since I have joined I have vastly surpassed even my own expectations for how much impact I have had. I own a major portion of the product for which I have written several complicated technical features on my own. I am leading investigation into another product line we want to launch and I do a substantial amount of hiring. The CEO and CTO have both offered great positive feedback about the amount of product value and engineering quality I am delivering.

I'd like to ask to bump my ownership to 2%, even if we settled at 1%. I am wondering if it's too early to ask. We're probably at least a year away from series A."
851,cscareerquestions,Kinda confused about the background check process for my internship offer.,"I'm currently a sophomore and was just given my first internship offer by an employer. In other words, I have never been employed before. In my resume that I submitted to the employer, I had listed prior unofficial volunteer roles associated with clubs in my high school.

Note that this high school is in another country far away, and this position is in North America.

None of these roles are internships, in fact a lot of students partake in these, it is basically club activity stuff. However, I had listed them under work experience, since the technologies I dealt with were relatable to the position I applied for.

The company asks all its employees to go through a 3rd party Background checking company.  
This 3rd party company has a form that we fill out, which asks for employer stuff. Mainly it checks for credit history, possible criminal history, etc.

Now, should I even put in my previous ""work experience"" in the employments section? or should I simply say that this company is my first employer? Since I've never been employed before.

Or should I still list these in the employments section and just give the email address or contact details of my teacher back in high school in another country? Kinda confusing.

Thanks for the help!"
852,cscareerquestions,Should I be a recruiter?,"I am a frontend developer, and I talk to clueless recruiters almost everyday and I get the impression that I can do their job much better than they can. It is clear that they have very little technical understandings. Some recent examples:

1. Recruiter didn't know that 'React' and 'React.js' was actually the same thing. Just imagine how many people get filtered out in this kind of scenario just because he/she didn't include for "".js"" or used some other naming convention.
2. Recruiter asking about if I had experiences in ""x"" when my resume and LinkedIn clearly shows no. Imagine how much time these recruiters waste for being incompetent in basic screening. 
3. Recruiter demanding expertise in backend technologies for frontend developer roles. I get the impression that this arises from misunderstandings between the hiring manager and recruiter. These so-called ""back-end"" requirements are probably more like ""nice-to-have"" or just hiring managers explaining their stack. In fairness though, sometimes frontend roles are actually full-stack roles but primarily consists of  front-end duties.

Doesn't anyone else here share the same sentiment that you can outperform these recruiters with barely trying? I mean it's a commission-based job, right (sky is the limit)?"

857,cscareerquestions,My job search experience with 2 YOE: it gets much better after your first job,"
TL;DR: First job out of college was for 70k TC at a ""tier 4"" insurance company. Just got offers for my 2nd job search 2 years later for ~170k TC at ""tier 2/3"" companies (not FAANG or unicorn etc). Shared some tips at the end


Preface: I wanted to offer a beacon of hope to those feeling hopeless and/or dissatisfied with their job search as a new grad. I know I always wondered if it will get better and I want to share my data point to prove that it indeed does once you have your foot in the door. (unfortunately I can't offer much advice for new grads still struggling to find their first job, other than to just keep applying, especially to F500 companies)

My first job search out of college was miserable; applied to 100s of places, big and small, and my only offer was a return offer from my internship: an average insurance company with ~70k total compensation. My callback rate from cold applications was dishearteningly low. Probably only got like 5 interviews and ended up failing them at at various stages due to various reasons (willing to go into details if you're curious but trying to keep the OP short)

Fast forward around 2 years later and the search has been so much better. I roughly tracked some statistics and I cold applied to around 50 or so companies, and got callbacks from around 20 of those to set up phone screenings. I was getting reached out to by a ton of recruiters from tier 1/2/3 companies as well and had a referral for a few.

 In total I interviewed with around 20 companies, got offers from 3, rejections from 4, and cancelled other processes at various stages for various reasons. 

To give you an idea of the type of companies I finally had a shot at: I had recruiters contacting me from all of MS/FB/Goog/Amazon/Doordash but decided to not interview with them for various reasons. Recruiters from places like HBO Max, Salesforce, GrubHub reached out as well. This was all a pipe dream in college. To know that I was actually able to take a shot at finally interviewing with these caliber of places was so uplifting.

 In college, the hardest part was getting the interview. Now, I could finally practice leetcode / system design etc without the worry that all the prep time would go to waste with me not getting a chance to showcase what I learned.

I know the current job market probably contributed to how easy it was to get a chance with companies, but the general sentiment here is that mid level and above devs will always have a much easier time regardless.

Some tips that helped me get the interviews:

 Put some time into your LinkedIn profile, turn the setting on for ""open to work"", and you'll have recruiters flooding in. I can't say much for embedded or other focuses but web app development is in high demand and probably will be for a while.

Your resume obviously matters a lot too especially for cold applications. Won't go too much into details here as there's already a lot of resources in this sub for that but my main advice is to say what you built/did, what technologies you used, and try to quantify the impact your efforts had.

Also, I applied primarily to fully remote positions and a few hybrid. it's awesome to see how many of those options there are these days.

Comments on the interview itself: 

I could list out all the system design and leetcode resources but I won't bore you with that as that's also easily searchable from other posts here. In my experience, since I only interviewed with tier 2/3 companies, I actually rarely got asked any leetcody questions and it was more focused on sys design, object oriented design, and the few algo problems I did get asked were easier string/array type problems, or low-mediums at worst. I did get asked a leetcode higher medium / hard by one company and only managed to get brute force but still passed the interview. My intention for this post was to focus more on the ""landing the interviews"" part of the process but if you're curious with specifics I can go more in depth with what helped me do well in technical and behavioral and what it sounded like the interviewers were looking for. 

To summarize, it felt like my interviews were generally more focused on practical knowledge rather than algo-heavy. This might be because I interviewed only with tier 2/3 companies rather than the absolute top highest paying ones.


I'll end the post here for now in an effort to keep this from getting really long and tiring to read, but definitely happy to answer any questions and explain anything in more detail in comments! I just hope this goes to show that if your end goal is top tech, then you can still get there even if your first/current job isn't that fancy, and if you're like me and don't really feel like grinding for faang, you can still get a huge salary increase from companies a tier or 2 below."

Alternatively, I am waiting to get my offers from companies in Fintech and FAANG. Starting pay at these would be higher. The name looks good on a resume. But I may not enjoy them as much as the smaller company.

Would taking a job with the lesser known company negatively impact my career trajectory? Is having a software engineering job on the resume enough to move into mid-level jobs down the line, or do we really need that FAANG experience?

Also, do you always go for the most money? What am I not considering as a new grad choosing a first job?

870,cscareerquestions,I got demoted from lead to engineer and co-workers think I am jealous of the new lead,"Department I worked at (as an engineer) was hugely understaffed, told them we needed to hire someone to lead the department, they instead hired a junior and put me as the lead even though I had none of the necessary credentials. I ended-up responsible for solving the understaffing problem, hired a few good people and one terrible senior engineer that made me burnout.

Took 5 weeks of vacation to recover from the burnout, decided I was going to quit the lead role because I hated it and much preferred being an engineer. When I got back I had a meeting with management to told them I was leaving the lead, but before I could say anything they informed they had hired someone to lead the department. I would still keep my lead pay, but the new lead would take almost all my responsibilities as a lead and was also going to reduce my overall amount of work as an engineer.

It was the perfect outcome for me, except everybody (management, other engineers and new lead) started treating me like I am jealous of the new lead. Instead of telling me the new guy would replace me, management created a new title to him just to avoid saying I wasn't a lead anymore. When other engineers talk to me they have a pitiful tone.

Just this week I missed a meeting called by the new lead, and the only reason I didn't participate is because I didn't check my email, but that just served to reinforce the jealousy narrative and the new lead had a ""you see, I am not your enemy"" talk with me.

I don't care much about what people think, but I am worried this will start being a problem at some point and I don't know what to do."

874,cscareerquestions,SkillStorm remote work possibility.,"After months of searching I am considering joining Skillstorm. I have a masters in CS however I can't seem to even get an interview literally like 100 rejections not sure what im doing wrong. I've gotten my resume reviewed so atleast now I get rejections but still no interviews. I've been leetcoding for a while now and feel confortable with my programming problem solving skills and knowledge of different datastructures and algorithms. However i've never made a website or app or anything practical except from machine learning projects in school and alot of papers. 

Should I just move forward with Skillstorm, pros of the program is its fully remote for the training, where you are placed is also remote and they actually pay a decent amount for the training. Also the pay is the same as what I get now and I really don't like where I am now. Ive been here for 3 years since graduating. I guess I could try to make some apps or websites to showcase but i feel like that will mean another couple months to get a solid projects then more months to even get interviews. 

I know the blanket statements to these types of jobs is dont do it but I feel like suffering for 2 years is worth it to get the experience to start making north of 6 figures in the future. Also the platform I would be trained for is appian and the mean stack."

They also verbally stated when I complete my degree I may have advancement opportunities, so I’m not sure what my decision should be. (It’s a three year program so I would have another year of school to complete)"

878,cscareerquestions,C#/.NET development advice,"Hi all,

I have been employed as a software developer for 3 years and I want to focus on c# .net development.

Currently where I am employed a smaller dev house there are so many technologies we use, including SQL, React, React Native, [VB.net](https://VB.net), C# .net, .Net Framework 4-4.8, Core 2-3 and 5 . There are Winforms and WPF projects, UWP, Xamarin native and API's, Azure Functions, Services, etc. It has been ""mostly"" backend but there have been UI tasks as well.

I've found it very difficult to have much depth of knowledge because the tech stack is so wide, I had a couple talks with recruiters and some positions they have/want to put me forward for and I am concerned that my knowledge in C# is lacking to get anything beyond a junior role.

For example the last conversation I had, asked some questions that I struggled with such as defining boxing, unboxing and extension methods(I thought this was another term for overrides).

What would be the best way of preparing for a more .Net focused role ,  I've started experimenting with a Blazor Web App in my free time lately, which is great for developing actual coding skills but I think I am lacking a lot of the theory and terminology I need. Are there specific online resources, courses or books I should be looking at?

Do you think I should try and jump to a new company ASAP? (I would have to do this remotely as I live in Rural Australia). The senior Dev I work with is very competent but code reviews are rare, I worry a new remote opportunity will make the mentor aspect worse.  Should I instead devote a big chunk of free time for the next few-6months and try to land a standard dev job after then?"

Just wondering how bad it looks on my CV if I switch again.

881,cscareerquestions,Database Manager vs Data Analyst,Wanted to hear from people who might have worked in any of these positions. What is the main difference? Can someone who has little experience in the data field make it as a database manager?
882,cscareerquestions,"A CS career question, sans actual career","Hi all, I'm a recent school leaver who was just offered a place in an undergraduate medicine course (I'm based in Australia), which I'm incredibly grateful for - and still incredulous as to how I got it! However, my finger still hesitates over the ""Accept"" button.

I'd been so doubtful of my capabilities that I had become heavily invested in my backup - computer science/actuarial double. For the better half of the year I'd been going back and forth between med and CS, lurking on reddit and other forums in hunt of information regarding prospects, satisfaction and salary. Now, I'm not dense enough to believe all those bloated, selection-bias riddled $250k graduate positions everyone flouts on these platforms, but there's still a certain allure to the field which earnestly piques my curiosity.

It'd gotten to the point where I had formulated a plan to eventually work in the US for a good few years, for the experience of another culture, a different pace of life, the sense of independence. Oh, and their more generous salaries don't hurt either. I had also wanted to complete a few months of exchange overseas - med does not allow for either.

I'm not into med just for the money - I really do want to help people, I don't believe there's anything more rewarding than being able to save lives and being *the* doctor who makes a difference. I've also read about the darker side of 9-5s and the lack of personal satisfaction that people feel from their jobs, intense burnout from always having to keep up with *the latest thing* in tech, wading through 5 layers of middle management just to negotiate having Wednesdays off. I'm not going to lie either - the generous and reliable financial renumeration of med is pretty sweet too - but as everyone says, there's much easier ways to make money, and there is a substantial opportunity cost of time: social life, personal life, FOMO: watching those in your friend circle graduate, establish solid careers, move on with life before you. I'm just not sure of the extent of my passion exceeds the extent of that sacrifice.

I'm also aware that I can transfer between degrees and that it's much easier to leave medicine than it is to start. However, I also tend to be rather stubborn and I will see things through to the end, and slog my guts out to get there if need be.

Yes, it may seem incredibly short-sighted of me to consider declining a medical degree which promises lifelong job/financial security for the promise of being able to graduate and start a degree a few years earlier. Yes, I know that those tech dreams are wildly ambitious and idealistic - perhaps cliche, but nothing is truly impossible.

But to hit the ""Accept"" button on my current offer seals all permanence.

898,cscareerquestions,How can stop getting frustrated at work and being stuck in a job hopping cycle?,"Hi

I am in my early thirties and now have recently started to introspect into my career. I have a rage quitting problem. Because I know I can easily get another job, as soon as something happens that is out of my control and I deem I can have no influence over, I quit. I can have an offer for a new company usually within less than a month. I also have a decent amount of savings so I could also realistically not work for 5 years if I needed to. So I don't have any financial pressures. 

Problem is that its a repeating cycle. I have been working as a Developer for over a decade now. I switch companies (get a bit more money because why not) and then get frustrated and quit again and again.

I got into computers when I was about 12. I was building websites I think before 14. I really love it. It's super fun. I have probably been programming in some way for around 20 years. I have read most books and popular blogs and other online content about it. I am very knowledgeable.

What do I get frustrated by?

I get frustrated when developers basically do really poor work or when management and leadership lack even basic organisational or planning skills. I do try to help them improve and change but usually give up quite quickly because I realise that these type of people are like this because they don't want to learn.

In one specific example, I recommended a Senior Developer read a specific book that I thought would help them. Around a month later and I asked them if they'd read it. They had not. I decided to buy them a copy of the book and send them the pdf/ebook. They said thanks. Around 3-6 months later I asked if they had read it. They said that they don't have time to read it. They also mentioned that this employer will not pay them to read books during work. I clarified that I meant they read it outside of work in their own time. They said that they would not do that. I asked them if they had ever read a programming book since graduating. They had not. I am probably 10-20 times more productive than these types of people. The truth is that more than 90% of the programmers out there are like this. 

What should I do? I am genuinely thinking about trying becoming an uber driver or another job and keep programming as a hobby on the side. I have also thought of switching into Product Management. I cannot do people management. I don't really have the patience to go through the academic process of getting a PhD and doing research. But that is also an option.

Thanks."

However I feel like I need **a lot** more time to get good at this, I may even need master degree to get fluent in Data Science. Just a few months are not enough and honestly I feel like I'm competing against those with Master/Phd and years of experience. As a software engineer I'm more familiar with API and data transformation type of job, which is more on the side of Data Engineer. But I really don't know if Data Engineering is what I should be pursuing, dealing with SQL and Spark, I want to craft prediction models more, however at the same time I know I'm not experienced enough to really be good at the job. Plus, not every company hires Fresher position for this job, it's mostly C#, backend, Angular/React frontend that sort of stuff. Data scientist is mostly for Senior role

902,cscareerquestions,Company has less than 12 months runway left,"Our CEO has recently laid out what we want to do for 2022. He said a couple things that kinda alarmed me and I'm not so sure what to do. Our main product has just been released and while we have a few customers we've been told we need many many magnitudes more to self sustain. Our main marketing person left recently so that's just not going to happen.

The roadmap for the dev team is unatainable as far as I'm concerned. We're starting another product that the timeline says should be done in 6 months, but the scope of it is truly on the level of a few years to be done well. It's a highly complex product where a bug could cause people to lose a lot of money. We still would need to support the currently running project at the same time. A lot of us devs expressed our concerns with this but we moved on from the topic.

We're also actively looking for investors. I didn't know it until today, but we've got a run way of a little less than 12 months. 

Practically, investor money is the only way I see the company surviving. I'm really concerned about these things, but the rest of the team has been going on about work as usual. I thought there'd be more panic but I feel like I'm the only one really worried?"

Recently I have encountered some more serious issues; I have made mistakes ( I believe everyone does ) but when I have 1:1 meetings with my team lead he continually refers to one mistake I made months ago ( which was asking him for the same information twice ) as though it were a recurring issue. I asked him recently when he brought it up if he could provide more examples of this type of issue and he could not, he then continued to say that I needed to ensure I can see the whole problem before beginning work. Again I asked for examples of this in my daily work and he could not come up with any. While this was frustrating as there was no feedback on how to improve and grow myself I figured I could just ensure I’m doing my best and it would blow over. I was wrong.. I was chatting with my manager about career paths and pursuing a role change/promotion and he brought up the issue of me having to do work twice( And  therefore he could not trust me with more responsibility), when I asked for examples he had one, which I looked back on later and it was an issue of changing requirements, not me submitting dysfunctional work.  I am so confused and frustrated , I can accept when I make a mistake, and I can accept that I have room to grow in my skillet before moving forward with my role ! I am even okay with constructive criticism. I just do not know how to approach this situation. One or two mistakes ( that in all honesty should have been caught in a pr review) do not in my mind equal recurring issues as was presented to me.

Hello! This is a crossover from r/csmajors..... They recommended posting here.   
I (31F) have been in the education field for a decade; teaching, special ed, private consulting, and tutoring. However, my passion for it is long gone, and I honestly don't think I ever really wanted to go down this career path, I was just from a smaller town and didn't realize the vast world of possibilities out there!

I am looking for a career change, and know that CS and tech are huge right now and have a lot of potential for the future. I have never really been that interested in tech, but some of it seems like it could be fun, challenging, and promising, but I am still unsure and I am totally lost as to how to begin. Ideally, I would want to somehow use my skills and knowledge to work for a non-profit or a corporation dedicated to animals (ASPCA, Humane Society Internation, etc.), and I have pretty severe ADHD and anxiety so I definitely would like to work from home. But again, I am newer than new to this and all of my ""researching"" has just made everything more confusing.

I'd like to think I'm fairly smart, I love problem-solving and puzzles and challenges, and I already have a BS and MEd. Would it be recommended to do some free online courses through Coursera or edX first, or just try to jump into a college program? Should I go for a Masters or just a Bachelors? Are there any specific specialties that would be a better fit for me and allow me to use my previous schooling and experience? Thanks in advance for helping out such a noob. ;)

TL:DR- 30 something looking to change careers from education to CS, and want to be able to work remotely. How do I begin? What programs would be recommended? Is there any way to utilize over a decade of my schooling and experience?"

I'm inclined to make the jump if they offer me at least more than the scraps I get at HCL and for the ability to get software engineering back on my resume.

I've been 9 years working in this industry. I was one of these stupid kids who wanted to make videogames and ""live the life"" but the salaries being shit, the requirements being too high and me not being the best among my peers kept me away from that ""dream."" I wasted several years on personal projects that led to nothing and ended up settling for your generic development job making web applications. At least I would get to build things and see them working. Or so I thought.

All I wanted was to get into a development team in a decent company and grow from there. Get tickets asking me to build something, add something or fix something. Do some programming. Discuss on function names, design patterns and automation of shitty tasks. Maybe in a few years get to know how to build things on a bigger scale. What I've found has been lies, dead end jobs that used niche technology (too old stuff, proprietary stuff, frameworks only used by two companies worldwide) and an infinite stream of well-meaning corporate speech that ends up with no one committing to shit, no one being responsible for shit and me burning like an oil well in early 90's Kuwait.

I am a ""backend Java developer."" Somewhat my title also includes ""senior."" So obviously during my career I've been asked to do manual QA, IT, pipeline maintenance, application deployments, configuration fixing, business analysis, to become full stack, to talk in public and do presentations. 

And I get -and I fucking hate to police my speech every time I complain, but there's always someone with an ACTUALLY loaded- that development work is not only writing code. Is doing technical analysis of requirements. Is understanding coding standards and patterns. Is making meaningful unit tests. But it fucking look like for most companies a ""developer"" is a jack of all trades (with 9 years experience in spring boot, maven and java 8, please) that can be used to anything everywhere but actually write good software.

I'm so fucking tired of all of this. I want to make shit, break shit and fix shit. I'm tired of the corporate speech everyone uses, of the feelings of inadequacy with new stack/tech, of having to fight what my boss wants me to become, of having to keep a continuous eye out to keep myself current and employable. ""Programming"" seems to be the only profession where doing the actual action that is described in the name is the less important part of the job.

And the worst of all is that this is all I know to do. And I'm a point in which all I know is that I don't know what to do. And yeah, I'm burnt out. I will get a week out of work soon.

921,cscareerquestions,Getting a job as a new grad?,"Hey guys,

I just wanted your opinions on what I should be doing in order to get a job as a new grad. For some context, I'm an F-1 visa student in his second semester of his Junior year. I haven't done any noteworthy side projects or prepared for interviews using LeetCode so far because I wasn't sure if I wanted to to go grad school or not. However, I think right now I'm leaning towards trying to find a job after graduation. Given my inexperience in coding interviews and an empty portfolio, I planned to take a gap semester after finishing my Junior year to focus on personal projects (through hackathons or building things that seem interesting) and coding interviews (I started doing 2 LeetCode questions everyday, and plan to study the ""Cracking the Code Interview book"" during this time). 

My goal is to try to snag a software engineering internship at companies in Silicon Valley (e.g. Apple, Google, Amazon, etc.). During the semester, I can only find time to do 2 LeetCode questions a day while balancing my time between studies and Resident Assistant stuff. I wanted to hear about your thoughts and opinions to see if this is a right choice or not, and would appreciate any input on the matter. If it helps, this is my current resume ([https://imgur.com/a/XHBzVbS](https://imgur.com/a/XHBzVbS))

Last year I took 2 courses (HTML/CSS/Javascript and Java for mobile app dev) that I was really engaged in. Since then I have: tried to practice more Web and Mobile dev, started a personal website project , and completed a 50-hour internship with my university's Systems and Network Admin.

Over this past winter break, I took some time to submit my resume to several companies. One had asked for a coding interview with content that was way beyond my skill set.

I do not believe that the projects I worked on in both courses nor the one I've made shows any reasonable skill level needed to be hired for an entry position, but I am still passionate for the general field of IT.

I am completing my undergraduate degree in May with great academic scores, with no job lined up.

Currently Im working with springboot and angular so I was thinking of just getting more familiar with these by building more projects on them and maybe working a bit with AWS for a cloud tool and MongoDB or mySQL for db.

935,cscareerquestions,Sysadmin vs. Software Engineering for first internship (want a career in Cybersecurity),"I'm currently in university studying CS, taking a year out to do a paid internship. My ideal job at the moment is in something along the lines of pentesting, but I know that this is very hard to get into at an entry-level. There are a few cyber internships going but they're very few and very competitive so I can't really get my hopes up too much.

On the other hand I've been offered to do a internship at a small software company. They are offering both placements for the Sysadmin side of things, and Software Engineering, and would be happy for me to do whichever I am more interested in.

If I were to pick between these, which would be best given my career goals? On one hand Sysadmin is more relevant to cyber security from what I know, but I also know that it's more on the IT side of things while I'm studying CS - so would a software engineering role be more valuable experience/aligned with my degree?

I am still definitely interested in software engineering even if I want to go into cyber in the future, and I haven't done a single internship or work placement before now so I want to gain the best experience I can while I have the opportunity.

Thanks for any advice."

I have accepted an internship with a tech company for an entire year due to being a graduate student. The position best aligns with my future career and is in the cloud sector.

940,cscareerquestions,"Experiencing demotivation, thinking of changing careers. Need objective advice!","I need some objective advice and an assessment of the situation, because I'm uncertain if I'm lying to myself and only think I am technically very capable **or** that I'm actually technically capable and the situation is not so great and I should consider moving to a non-technical role. 

So, my background is in electrical engineering. Did average (3.05 GPA, did stupid shit like flunked psych 100) during college, not exceptional -- I attribute this to depression through my early college years due to physical abuse in my childhood which I was still emerging out of. However, did exceptionally well on the topics that interested me. At the time, these were in electrical engineering and topics in physics (EM waves) that very close to my childhood interests in science and research.

After graduation, Big Software Corp hired me to work on hardware products. However, the role wasn't very interesting and the task I was working on, I found mundane. I decided to move towards its Software services, since maybe that's where the innovation is. However, found that there isn't much innovation in the project I am working and also, software engineering is a little different. While I'm learning the skills (such as DS&amp;A and about microservices) on the job, it seems that it's hard to keep up with cs - educated undergrads. For the first time in my 4 year long career, I'm hearing consistently poor feedback about my technical aptitude from management. Due to spiraling anxiety about the technical work in a domain I don't know that well and a lack of interest in what I'm actually working on, I work maybe 3-4 hours a day of which 2 hours is likely high quality time. 

This definitely doesn't help my case. What I'm wondering is if I should try to find another cs-related role which might be more motivating for me to work on with the new innovative technologies coming up or simply switch to a different role which is less technical -- since I'm actually innately lacking technical aptitude. I'm uncertain if I'm lacking motivation or technical aptitude. Since, I feel that I simply haven't had time or deep thoughts about the field I'm newly in. But I'm also unsure about what the truth is and if I'm just lying to myself, maybe I should find a role that I can fall into more easily and doesn't require immediate technical expertise to this depth."

also it will be better to use hours only and not days or months or years. some may study 1 hour or 5 hours or even 8 hours per day. it depend on one's time and dedication so it seems that hours are more accurate method of time calculation.

I know pretty much where the best places are to find answers, but not necessarily the answers. We're working on developing all of that documentation, but it's been slow going and we keep getting sniped for other things that are SUPER URGENT and definitely take priority over the other SUPER URGENT things (and I have to field or consult on most of them, because I'm the only one who knows it) even when they're technically deprioritized. It's not even just documentation we need to work on; it's *expertise*. The idea is that not only should someone who sees the documentation not really need to ask questions, but that whoever studies the journey should *be* an expert on the thing. No questions, no extra complexities, no ""I'm gonna need to look that up and get back to you."" Maybe this is me just admitting that I'm a bad SWE, but the more I do this, the more impossible it feels. And I am just burning out so quickly. I'm really just losing all the fucks I have to give anymore. 

I have a 1:1 with my lead soon and I just... do not know what to say. I have plenty of things I could say but nothing worth saying. This documentation prioritization is coming from above, so there's no getting out or around it (I'm also not the only one working on it, so it's not like it's all on me). I'm not really sure that I want to fly the coop just yet (at least not for another SWE job because I haven't actually done technical interviewing in a while and I don't have the energy to relearn it and practice my algos and whatnot, but I don't know what I would want to pivot to that pays me as much or better) so it's not like I can have any of them staring down the barrel or they have to give me more money to deal with it. They are still going to need me to consult on things, I don't expect that to change. There are some other folks on other teams that they could consult with for some things, but no one who has specific knowledge of what we work on (at least for my side of things) and the person who knows the most about that section leaves us on read more often than not.

Graduated on May last year and a few months later got offered a position at my current job. I like full stack development but this one was for “something Java” at a consulting firm which I was fine with. Ended up being changed from trainings one or two times because for what I had started training in the potential client went with another company and ended up at a position I don’t really like customizing programs used in factories for clients.

Where it gets hard for me to quit is because 4 of us new hires went along with that training for like 2 and a half months and I was the only one to pass it. So my manager was really happy to get one extra set of hands on it. But before I get completely certified I have to work on a project “shadowing”. That was not happening because of covid so I’ve just been sitting here and getting paychecks in the mean time.

A while back my manager from a company I had interned at a year+ ago and loved the team and the work reached out and told me the team had a position opening up and asking if I was interested. I said yeah of course since I’m not doing anything in my current job. And we seem to be going through the company’s hiring process as a formality since I think they already know they wanna give me the position since they had worked with me and reached out to me directly and even made a new job listing specifically for me to apply to.

Luck come to have it, I am finally starting the shadowing project for my current job training next week after 5 months in the company (2 and a half training and 2 and a half doing nothing). And next week is also my last interview with the other job.

I am feeling nauseous just thinking about getting the offer I know I will wanna take and having to quit having done nothing at my job and leaving my manager disappointed."

Background: I’m currently finishing my Master’s in CS coming from a humanities background (undergrad in humanities, former caseworker &amp; ESL teacher). I’m currently working part time for a JR college in IT support, while I finish school and graduate in the spring.

The Situation: I was internally referred to, interviewed for, and was offered a full time position on the East Coast (I’m from the Midwest) for a company that deals with major banks. As much as I want to take the offer and feel it would be a great opportunity:
1) My 2nd interview was rescheduled twice on short notice (less than 24 hours) after I had already moved around my own schedule to accommodate their schedules, and they were unwilling to try to accommodate me… which left me feeling less than stellar about the situation.
2) They offered me less money than the target salary I mentioned at the beginning of the process (bummer, but not the end of the world even though they asked). 
3) I would be expected to relocate on my own dime, which I would presently be unable to do/afford.
4) They want me relocate within 60 days of starting, even though I’m in the middle of a school term… even though based on what I found out is that the office is presently working remote.

My concern: When I spoke with HR on the phone and was given the verbal offer, I questioned points 3 &amp; 4 and it hardly seemed like they were willing to work with me. Which considering how many applications, interviews, and rejections it took for me to get here I still would like to take the job as I feel the position would be a great opening into tech.

&amp;#x200B;

*Start up: cons -*

1) im worred its not stable bc startup (the CTO litterly told me he had to fire people bc they werent able to keep up and as a JR dev that makes me nervous)

2) worried startup doesn't look as impressive on my resume as the large fortune 500 firm

3) work life balance is gonna be shit

4) very stressful : (

5) ill be stuck at 1 company for atleast a yr 

6) networking opportunities limited to the job ie out side of my current coworkers i wont meet anyone else.

&amp;#x200B;

*Large Consulting Company : pros -* 

1) Outside of the large consulting company I *might* get more impressive names on my resume based on the projects I get (ie coke, shell, tesla, Facebook but not guaranteed)  

2) I've already been working there for 8 months Im almost at the 1yr mark so my resume wont look ""jumpy"" if I stay here.  

3) I have had a pretty decent work life balance  for my current contract.

4) remote

5) networking opportunities between lots of different companies.

6) can request to be moved to different projects.

&amp;#x200B;

*Large Consulting Company: cons -*

1) im worried its not stable as well bc im not sure what happens post contract but they said they'll work to get me on another project asap.

2) I wont get paid in-between projects

3) they arent providing a time line of how long it takes to find another project

4) contract

5) no benefits

6) less pay then other potential offers (\~$88k)

7) love to mico-manage

8) very corporate 

9) stressful but manageable.

10) jobs differ depending on project(ie sometimes the whole job is fixing bugs other times  the whole job is adding features other times its a mix of both what you get kinda depends on luck 😒)"
975,cscareerquestions,How important is online graduate school choice?,"Background:  I’m currently 30, have a bachelors+masters in civil engineering and I have a bit over 4 years of experience working as a traffic engineer in a west coast tech hub. My day to day functions are leading designs in CAD, meeting with municipality stakeholders, cost estimation, mentoring junior engineers/interns and performing technical writing for specifications. Its not a bad job at all, my issue is that I'm absolutely bored of my mind and the fact there's pretty much nothing that I need to really learn to continue climbing the ladder is pretty terrifying because I love learning new skills to apply to my work and feel my brain atrophying without the constant mental stimulation.


I’ve been thinking a lot about what I want and I realized I did enjoy programming  from my studies and I was even an undergrad TA for our programming course. So I’ve been working a bit on self studying python and am currently finishing coursework in data structures, analysis of algorithms and computer architecture at a community college this semester. I have already completed intro to programming and discrete math. I do enjoy structured learning to nail down the fundamentals and the formal coursework will be a boost on applications for a masters program (looking at OMSCS, ASU online MCS and UIUC online MCS). I would also like to have ability to intern.

When it comes to school choice, I can pretty much be positive I’ll get into ASU, the advantages are that it’ll be one of the quicker ones to complete and the cost is right in the center at 15k, but without the name recognition of UIUC/GaTech. I’m about 90% sure I’ll get into OMSCS, they have the most class options, are the most affordable and have great name recognition, only downside it’s the longest to complete. UIUC is the most competitive to get into of these online options, probably has the best name recognition and is the most expensive at 22k. It’ll take probably the same amount of time to complete as ASU but also has the least varied options for software engineering classes. 

Overall from what I know about myself now, my career goal is to get into backend software engineering. I’d love to try to land an internship and plan on spending this summer grinding leetcode/building a project to make that a possibility. Ideally I’d like to get a full time while in graduate school if that’s a possibility as well, which could change the calculus of this decision. 



Any advice would be appreciated!"

979,cscareerquestions,Scared about starting fulltime after internship experience,"Long story short, I have accepted a return offer from a big tech startup that I interned at last summer. My manager was really nice but I feel like my mentor was frustrated with me and did not like the pace I was working at. 

They wouldn't really spend much time explaining the codebase to me and basically wanted me to navigate myself from relatively early on. I recognise that at times I didn't spend a long amount of time trying to work through a problem before I asked about it but I feel that in general it was because of a lack of knowledge and understanding of a pretty big codebase instead of no effort being put in.

Anyways, I end up with the return offer because for the most part I met deadlines and while I don't think my work was as complex as other interns, I guess my manager thought it was good enough. However, my feedback from my mentor was really negative, basically saying that I don't know anything and I need to drastically improve. Also included a lot of complaints about the way I worked.

I found this entire experience super discouraging and now I am scared to actually return to the company. I feel like its been really hard for me to move on from this and be confident in my abilities or potential to improve. I am dreading returning to that same environment because I feel like it would be awkward after the feedback I got and that I would already be starting off on the wrong foot instead of being a clean slate. I just don't know how to navigate this situation."

982,cscareerquestions,Negotiating an offer from a start-up. Need your help in identifying the red flags if there are any," I have around 12 years of experience in developing enterprise applications and managing multiple teams. Recently, I was approached by a recruiter for a start-up with \~20 members. They have offered me the position of technical architect. Also a 40% hike on the fixed salary and granted $150k worth of shares vesting over the next 3 years. Now I do understand that the shares are as good as paper in a start-up ecosystem. I need help from all the experienced devs here to show me the red flags because I honestly don't see many. I'm happy to provide you with any other details that are required

I have had conversations with the founders and here are a few facts I'm taking into account while considering this offer

* I do like their idea and it's focused on privacy engineering and data protection. And I do believe that in the upcoming years, people will be aware of privacy issues and it would eventually be good for the company.
* The founder has exited from another start-up with a chunk of money and he is also the main investor in this one. He is literally paying us from his own pocket. He also sounds like he is not in this for the VC funds.
* When asked about the investment, I have realized that the money is not an immediate issue but building a scalable product is.
* The current valuation is just about $10 million as per the founder.
* The founder is ex-Microsoft and the co-founder is ex-Apple.
* They have one paying customer so far.
* The company was started in 2019 and survived the Covid outbreak
* The founder is in US and heading the sales efforts while the development team along with the co-founder is located in India.
* The founder and the co-founders have engineering and management backgrounds (GM in Microsoft). But I don't honestly see much experience in the sales and marketing department.
* I have been working with Microsoft technologies and JavaScript so far (.Net, C#, Angular/React, NodeJs) but their entire tech stack is python at the moment. I'm willing to put the efforts to learn and they're ready to give me the time I have asked for to become entirely productive (3 to 6 months)
* The team consist of a lot of junior devs (1 to 4 years) and I will be the most senior person in the company if we don't consider the founders"

985,cscareerquestions,Promotion as a Junior Dev,"Hey,

Last April I started working for a drone startup as the sole software developer. I do not have a degree nor any actual work experience besides this job.

I think I've done a pretty good job since everyone always seems to be praising me for the work I've accomplished.

Even though I'm the sole developer, our code upstream is open source and I collaborate with other developers so I've been learning a lot.

However, its starting to become that theres a lot of more work to be delivered and higher expectations to reach. Thus, I've been wanting for more developers to join our team to ensure we can improve the quality of the software.

Therefore, my question is: is it wise to ask for a promotion + raise to include the responsibility of hiring and managing other developers?

My concern is that I'm both inexperienced as a developer and as a leader. As a developer I manage and strive to become better everyday and as a leader, I have great supervisors and managers that have taught me a lot. But still, I'm a young professional.

Let me know what you think. Thanks!"

I have a lot of free time at this job to do that. Also the IT job doesn't pay any more than my current job. (I don't make a lot of money)

I made it clear to th inerviewer I have no previous knowledge in cyber security or networking(when he asked). But that I am quite intrested.

The thing is that from what he said it very much seems that I am expected to have knowledge even though its a junior position.

He gave me a task to think about at home and then talk to him. He did tell that he is not sure if I fit, and I assume the task is to see if I could learn th8ngs by myself.

The task just seems very complicated as someone that has no previous knowledge on cyber security and I'm not sure I think the job as he described to me as intresting.

My father works for a factory that makes LED signs, and is the lead designer of embedded systems and protocols. He has been teaching me little bits about building computers, finding the libraries for different components, and how to write protocols. It's fascinating!

I also have a friend who works for Jaguar in their self driving car development team, and everything he tells me about it is eye opening.

My father has agreed to partially fund my retraining as long as I know what ok getting into, and which particular branch I want to go into. I'm more interested in programming things for consumers as opposed to the industrial stuff that my father does.

I wanted to ask in r/CompTIA, but I didn't want to get biased answers so I am posting here for a more broader perspective! Also, these are not technical questions about the specific certificates but more the career-related aspect of it, so I thought putting this here was appropriate!

Hi all, I'm seeking some advice or even a point in the right direction.

As the title states, I have SAA-C02, DVA-C01 and MCSA: Web Applications(right before the cert was retired, if it matters). I'm currently employed at a small software consulting firm with responsibilities overseeing development teams and projects for several clients including schools, banks and insurance companies. I started there as a developer I've been promoted twice since working there. My responsibilities now include drawing up technical design documents, training and leading the dev teams, code reviews, DevOps, stakeholder meetings with clients and R&amp;D for new tools to add to our tech stack.

The work/life balance and culture of my company is great (once your work is done on time and you're available for meetings during the workday, all is well). The company went full remote recently and I've adjusted well to the new dynamic. The only issue with my current employer is the compensation. My salary is just decent since the company I work for is so small, there's not much room for growth there. Even if I apply to a larger company. there wouldn't be that much improvement because of the current job market in my country and I'll just be delaying the inevitable as the cost of goods and services in my country is heavily dependent on the US exchange rate.

I'm able to make ends meet now, but with a slipping dollar, I don't see how I am to survive and even afford a family. To give you an idea of my compensation range, without going into exchange rates and figures, I've seen positions for entry-level positions in the US and other countries which offer nearly 4x my current salary.

I've seen very good advice being given to persons looking to break into the tech industry and I'm hoping someone will be able to point me in the right direction to greener pastures and help me with where I could go to seek new employment opportunities as well as realistic salary expectations.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated."

1014,cscareerquestions,Any tips for landing a remote side job from Europe?,"Hello everyone,  

I graduated this summer with a Master's in CS and 3.5 years of programming experience in startups, so I'm used to working from 7 to 21. I quit my job and went to work for a bigger company as I plan on buying a house in 2022/2023 and it's way easier to get good credit while working for a stable company, which is really important to me as good houses go for 200-250k€.    

What surprised me was that even though I'm paid more, around 16k€ post-tax per year, I'm only working 2-3 hours per day as a Senior Angular developer. Some people might love this but I feel like I'm wasting my time and stagnating. I took over a friend's project, but it's highly unorganized as I have to make an entire SaaS application, around 300 hours of work, for only 6k€ post-tax. It has to work pretty well as the EU is founding it and there might be inspection (from my understanding), and there is no set specification so I'm mostly winging it.  

To summarize, I would like to get a side job (12-20 hours per week) that forces me to get out of my comfort zone, preferably in the USA or Europe. If it goes very well and the pay is good I'm even open to moving for a few years or working full time remotely from Croatia. In order to achieve this, I feel like I have to get better at algorithms as my college mostly focused on project management and web applications.  

This is my current plan:  
- Go over Pragmatic Programmer (1 month), Head First Design Patterns (1-2 months), Algorithms (3-4 months), and Cracking the Coding Interview (1 month)  
- Start practicing LeetCode while going over the Algorithms book  
- Start applying to jobs while going over Cracking the Coding Interview  
- Get additional certification in my main job - I currently have AWS Developer but I plan on getting AWS DevOps during next year"

So that's why I would like some advice on which field of Computer Science I should focus myself onto, instead of having a ""fear of missing out"" moment by not going for Machine Learning etc

\- Making object oriented projects where a bunch of classes talk to each other and together they make an overall application. Like a Unity C# game, or a raytracer in Java, or simple java awt applications

\- Solving Leetcode problems

Are there any fields of Computer Science that at it's core require these two things I listed above?

The only field I can think of is Software Engineering where you make applications for companies, debug their applications, etc and it's all pretty much object oriented.

I’m starting an MS in CS at an Ivy League university in the fall with a ton of pre-requisites, but from looking at the syllabi for my pre-requisites, there’s not really a focus on event-driven programming or GUIs. 

I have no SWE experience, but I know Java and Python. I can write a dice game or Boggle in Java with multiple classes, for example, but I have no idea how I’d make it into a program with a GUI and events, mouse clicks, etc.

Can anyone recommend a resource or free online class for learning this? Most of them I find have a lot of hand-holding around OOP, but I’m already very familiar with OOP and have written moderately sized programs in Java for classes I’ve taken."

While I believe myself to have a firm grasp over the language and the frameworks that have come to be associated with Java dev, I have found myself, on multiple occasions, lacking in core networking fundamentals. Things like port forwarding, proxying, reverse proxying(?), along with a lot of tech jargon that is associated with this completely knocks me tf out. And this is something I am looking to improve at.

I didn't do my undergrad in CS, so I have a big blindspot there. I am making my way through Computer Networking - A top down approach. But between the job and other stuff, I can barely make any meaningful progress.

So I am wondering if there are some other suggestions that people might have. Couple of options that I have considered:

1) Suck it up and just read the damn book. Cons: Is all of this even relevant? Will this actually help? 2) Take a networking course like CCNA or something from CISCO. Any specific course that anyone could recommend? 3) Pick up some AWS stuff directly (no prior exp with AWS) and go through the docs. Cons: SO much stuff. Where does someone even begin?

Thanks for any suggestions."
1027,cscareerquestions,What should my next career move be during/after my internship? (MSCS Student),"Hello fellow computer touchers,

Some info about me:
* 29 years old
* MS and BS in Chemistry (minored in Math during undergrad)
* currently employed full-time as a high school chemistry teacher, while completing a part-time MSCS.
* fortunate enough to have an internship lined up for Summer 2022. I'll be working on embedded software development for an aerospace company.
* completed coursework in DS&amp;A, computer architecture, networking, and operating systems

Here's the thing: I can't stand teaching teenagers anymore, and want out ASAP for a variety of reasons. The only thing keeping me going at the moment is the summer internship I'm looking forward to. I don't regret teaching, but I've had my share and am working very hard towards my new goal. Since I'm working full-time, I can only manage one course at a time for my MSCS (this puts me on track to finish in ~3 years). 

I'm weighing two options:
1) Take a summer class during my internship. This will ensure progress towards the completion of my MSCS.

2) Grind Leetcode on the side during my internship and apply for full-time entry level roles as soon as I have something to put on my resume from my internship. I already have a STEM degree with a decent amount of CS coursework, which is why I'm hopeful that having the internship on my resume will be enough for an entry-level SWE position.

The issue with this plan is that I don’t have a degree. I attended a school with a very prestigious CS and CE program as a CE major, and have about two years worth of credits. I also spent two summers at a very good internship program. But I feel my lack of degree will hold me back from finding a software engineering job at this point.

Is there a job that balances what I do now and what I want to do?","I made a post that can be found on my profile, but I wanted to make it shorter and simpler.

Basically: I went to college, got a BA in computer science (long story short: they combined degrees and I didn't have enough programming classes or math classes to be considered BS), graduated and applied for a tech role, did that for a little bit, but they've now stuffed me into a business role. I have ""little"" bits of experience here and there. A little as an automation scripter (I loved it! but they didn't keep me doing this for long), a little as a functional tester, a little IV&amp;V. Now they've got me taking notes all day and putting together PowerPoints. I'm a little frustrated by that and need to make a switch now. Work is not a challenge anymore. **It's not longer fun.**

My currently salary is also almost 6 figures basically, and I just graduated a couples years back. So I really want to try to keep it. Which is why I'm also a bit afraid of my lack of experience, because if I quit and try to go elsewhere, they'll be like ""Wait, why do you want XYZ salary when you can't even do ZYX?""

TLDR: I obviously have lost my ""technical"" experience since graduating in a way, and haven't exercised it in a long time. I'd like a job that isn't basically being a secretary, but will also accept my limited experience in testing/IV&amp;V and maybe give me the opportunity to learn more and do more problem solving/scripting or SQL?

Bonus Question: If I really do like SQL, but also like the business-y side of things, is there a role I can aspire for?

1042,cscareerquestions,BS in CS after my first semester: is it right for me?,"Hello, /r/cscareerquestions! 

I am at a bit of a crossroads; I am twenty-eight years old, and I am trying to finish my degree part-time online. My university has a CS program that I am currently in, and I made it through my first semester of Programming in Java with a C+. I am not really sure of what to think of my performance in the course, as our ""tests"" were mostly exercises of completing full programs in Java. (I know some universities carry courses that have some multiple choice segments in exams, but mine was not one of them.) I enjoyed programming! Well, some aspects of it, which is why I am at this crossroads...

My background is in the natural sciences (AS in Chemistry), so I have taken General Biology, General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, and Descriptive Inorganic Chemistry (the latter was at a four-year university some time ago). CS was a bit of a left turn for me, but I wanted something I could use with my previous passions which may also work better at providing me employment with a Bachelor's. (Though, I am not turned off completely to the prospect of further schooling either!)

I really enjoy the problem solving aspect of programming. Not knowing what to do is stressful, but working at the problem and solving it feels surreal. I am not the best at it, however, as some aspects aren't quite as intuitive to me as the natural sciences. I am a natural tinkerer. I love learning how things work.

That said, while my professor included some Java programs which we had to build that used science (one example was a program that applied General Relativity's equations, and creating the program to solve them based upon certain conditions), I have been reading that Java probably is not the best language to translate over to research in the sciences. I usually hear good things about Python and Fortran, but Java may be geared more easily toward CS itself. I wonder if I would be more interested in that? Then again, does this mean my interest in pure CS just isn't really there? Some of the aspects we have covered in Java have bored me to tears. It is a weird thing, as I know that I need to understand these aspects to understand further material. I just worry that I am in the wrong place.

For others that may have seen this kind of thing before (or perhaps been there before):

Is my C+ grade something incredibly worrisome for Intro to Programming's first semester? From what I have gathered from discussion boards in class, while I generally figured out how things worked, I may have taken a bit more time than a lot of my classmates before it really ""clicked"". It may be that this is my first exposure, or it may be that I am not really good at programming. I am trying to be honest here, so any honest answer is appreciated. It feels less ""solid"" to me than chemistry did. A lot of people felt chemistry seemed weird or foreign, but that stuff actually seemed to work with my brain! A lot of programming thus far has seemed a more theoretical, and I have had trouble grasping it as easily. 

I do enjoy programming, but I have been trying to hammer down if I enjoy programming for programming or if I just enjoy particular uses of it. Let's be real here: I wanted to try CS, because I know it is better for jobs than, say, a general science or social science. I just need to figure out where I stand with all of this.

TL;DR: Don't know what I'm doing. Halp.

Thanks!"

1048,cscareerquestions,10 questions to ask yourself when choosing a career," Your career has a big impact on your future. It can affect your identity, personal fulfillment, lifestyle, income, family and retirement.

Before you decide what career to pursue, carefully consider your options and ask yourself the following 10 questions:

## 1. What are my interests?

The activities you enjoy doing in your free time can give you insight into the careers that would be satisfying, fulfilling and fun. To figure out your interests, ask yourself:

* What hobbies do I enjoy?
* Do I prefer spending time indoors or outdoors?
* Do I enjoy working with people, animals, data or books?
* What activities would I miss the most if I could no longer do them?

## 2. What are my skills?

Right now, you possess skills that can help you succeed in the future. Think about your hard skills and soft skills.

* Hard skills - skills you’ve acquired through study, such as culinary arts or computer programming.
* Soft skills - the people and life skills you possess, including teamwork and time management.

## 3. What are my talents and strengths?

From the time you were little, you demonstrated talents and strengths that make you unique and can help you succeed in your chosen career. In fact, Sir Ken Robinson, author of *The Element, Out of Our Minds*, says that:

&gt;You owe it to yourself to ensure that there’s some 

If you don't know your talents and strengths, make a list of everything you’re good at doing. Your family members, friends, teachers, boss and mentors can help you write this list that you will use to narrow down potential careers.

## 4. What is my personality?

Your personality is the way you think, feel and behave. It can be an important part of your career, so consider several aspects of your personality as you think about your future.

* Are you a leader or followers?
* Do you prefer to work alone or in a group?
* Do you prefer to cooperate or compete with others?
* Do you enjoy helping others or prefer to empower them to do things themselves?
* Are you a thinker who focuses on ideas or are you a doer who takes action?
* Are you a creative and artistic person or do you thrive with structure and routine?

 

5. What are my values?

Everyone has values or things that are important to them, such as financial security, social justice or work-life balance. These values can help you decide what type of career to pursue. Here instance, consider a career that pays well if you value financial security, and consider a 9-to-5 job if you want to achieve work-life balance.

## 6. What education or training do I need?

Certain careers require advanced education and financial investment. For example, you may need eight to 12 years of education and training to be a doctor, but you could earn a hospitality management bachelor in four years. Think about the time and money required to pursue a career as you make your decision.

## 7. Are there jobs available in this career?

According to Eurostat, 21.4 million people work in personal services and sales, the two most popular careers in the EU. While you don’t have to work in one of these popular occupations, you should consider the potential job availability in your future career field.  The travel and tourism sector contributed US$7.6 trillion to the global economy and supported 292 million jobs in 2016. This was equal to 10.2% of the world’s GDP, and approximately 1 in 10 of all jobs.

## 8. How much money do I want to make?

Different careers provide different monetary rewards. Even though salary shouldn’t be the main factor in choosing a career, your paycheck can play a role in your quality of life and where you live. Consider your earning potential as you narrow your career options. 

## 9. Where do I want to live?

Some jobs are more readily accessible while others can only be performed in certain locations. For example, you will probably need to live in a rural location if you choose to work as a park ranger or farmer, and you may want to live near an urban area if you plan to pursue a finance or fashion career. Plan carefully to ensure you can work where you want to live.

## 10. Why do I want to pursue this career?

Always ask yourself why you want to pursue a certain career as you evaluate which choice is right for you. Don’t let the opinions or expectations of others sway your decision. Ultimately, your career choice is solely yours."

1051,cscareerquestions,Is it appropriate for me to ask about the salary range for a new graduate position before?,"I have gone through multiple interviews and am a bit burned out from them. I have done a few interviews, where the salary was not worth it. However, I only found about the salary later once getting the offer. I know I can search up online the salary, but Glassdoor, the main website I used, has not been as accurate. As a result, for an upcoming college graduate, is it appropriate for me to ask the recruiter to know the salary range before even starting the interview process? I read online that some people do recommend doing this but I did not see anyone ask for a new graduate position."
1052,cscareerquestions,Company placed me in position I have no experience in,"I originally interviewed for an SDE position, and was given an offer for an SDET position instead. In the offer letter, it states that I must be someone with 1+ years of industry testing experience, including experience with various testing tools and frameworks I’ve literally never used. However, I do have extensive experience with product development (SDE) along with languages, tools and frameworks used in product development. 


How does this make sense? Wouldn’t they want to place me in an area where I can excel the most? Would it be bad to tell them everything I’ve said here? I’m seriously considering asking them if they can move me to an SDE position and telling them why."
1053,cscareerquestions,"I'm a (sorta) new grad and I need a job ASAP, which route would be the best to go with?","Hello. I graduated with my CS degree last December. I didn't have an internship, but worked for a coding summer camp and taught Java to preteens. I didn't start looking for a software role in earnest until I graduated. Over the last year I've interviewed on and off with lots of companies, but never seemed to be able to get past the technical round. Next month, I have to start paying student loans, and come May, I will need to move and my rent will likely double. My question is what would be a good way forward for me?

My current job I took when I went back to school. They worked with my school schedule, but the pay is terrible and I don't get along with half my coworkers. It's a dead end job where you basically just have to be a warm body and they'll hire you. 

I have a friend who works in sales for a start-up and he says he can help me get a role as a Sales Development Representative. This isn't something I want to do, but I think I would be a good fit. Before my degree, I worked for a successful and large retail firm. I was consistently one of the top sales people globally every year. I left that because I hated working holidays, inconsistent hours, and low pay. I had always wanted to work in a more technical role and went back to school. I do think my background and degree would benefit me in a software sales role, but I would just want to use this as a stepping stone until I get get a better job. I would essentially just want this role for the increased pay compared to my current job until I could figure out what to do next. 

I started the year applying to Full Stack SWE roles, and general SWE roles. I didn't get as many call-backs as I had hoped, so by summer I started applying to QA, SDET, and SRE roles since I heard they are easier to land. I have had more success with call backs for QA roles, but during the interview they frequently ask me about tools, technologies and techniques I was never exposed to during my degree. 

Since my graduation, I had only done one personal project, a full stack MERN app. I have been riding that and my degree over the last year hoping that would be enough. I don't think it is, and the project itself is starting to become dated on my resume. I started grinding leetcode the last month and I really think that would be beneficial to me. A lot of questions I've come across on LC I have seen in real interviews, I also think I should work on another project, but am not sure what it should be. I have been interested in learning more about Java Spring framework.

So I am wondering what advice you all have about how I should proceed? Should I take the sales role, until I figure out what to do? Would that hurt my jump into a SWE role? Should I continue to grind leetcode and keep applying for SWE/SDET/QA/SRE roles? Or should I keep applying to SWE roles and work on another side project in the mean time?

First time posting here, and looking for some advice. I have been working as a Consultant at company X for just over 2 years. In the last year I have been one of, if not the top performer on my team, despite being by far the youngest. I am very happy with my work / life balance and company culture, love my boss, but I do believe my pay should be better. I know some colleagues of mine are making more, granted they have been with the company for longer / have more experience.

Currently I am making $70,000 base salary plus 30% commission on new business, which turns to 40% if I hit my target. No residual commission. Current target is $125,000 / year.

I recently received a job offer for a very similar role at $100,000 base salary, with 50% first year commissions and 30% residual once I am managing enough business to cover my $100,000 base. ($300,000)

At first though the residual commission makes this a no brainer. With that said I am so happy at my current environment that I am not sure I want to take this new role. I would have to go in office, and it would be much worse from a work / life balance standpoint. I'd also obviously have to prove myself all over after finally doing so in my current position. I would like to leverage this with my current employer, but am worried about tarnishing the relationship in any way.

1062,cscareerquestions,Help to implement C++ in my career,"Hi, I just finished my first semester as a cs major, and my Introduction to programming professor recommended learning c++ for my next semester, where I will be taking an algorithm class since we only used python until now.

And it would be much better to be able to do that and build a usable knowledge of c++, both for my future classes and my career. 

So my question is, what is the most efficient way to do that?, should I read a book on c++?, an online course(most preferably with a certification)? Both?

My next semester starts in February, maybe that's useful info :p. I know it's not enough time to really learn it, since it seems like a very complex and large language, but at least some appliable knowledge.

Any suggestions and or tips will be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance :D."
1063,cscareerquestions,Should I do an unpaid summer internship if I have no other options?,"I wanted to do a co-op from January to June and applied to over 200 positions and I got three interviews and zero offers. Because of that, I have to scratch that plan. I've decided to do a summer internship instead and have applied to a few positions, one of which is an unpaid ML-related internship for a recent startup. I've gotten a technical interview from them but I've heard that unpaid internships are not worth it, which makes me hesitant to consider it. 

The problem is, I'm clearly so worthless that I can't even get one offer after applying to over 200 positions so this may be my only hope at getting some experience to get my foot through the door. I don't even care that it's unpaid honestly. I just want to get some experience on my resume other than a few mediocre personal projects. 

What do you think? If I get an offer from them, should I do it or not? I know it's better to do a paid internship but beggars can't be choosers, right?"
1064,cscareerquestions,"After a challenging year, work now makes me anxious","I'm in my 2nd year as a working professional. My 1st year was pretty enjoyable as I focused on getting work done and developing features and I was pretty good at it. However, as my company is pretty sketch with promotional criteria, it really hurt me when I didn't receive a promotion after my first rotation.

My 2nd year was then a journey of proving myself again on my 2nd team. But this team didn't have as many seniors so it was a challenge finding things out for myself and learning as I go. I also wanted to tackle more high visibility work, which led to an intent that dragged on for months in the planning stage. Every meeting was a stress bubble, feeling like I had to speak up and sound like I know what I'm talking about and that I'm smart and capable, even when things were confusing or I didn't have good answers. I even started smoking weed during the work day just to even myself out for meetings. I was constantly trying to prove myself as someone who's promotion ready, and I stressed myself out to not only do good work but also work that would impress come promotion time, and truly own the things that I worked on in every aspect, which was honestly a lot for someone like myself who's still learning how to be a senior. My manager was great and supportive but not personable, so I didn't really feel like I had someone I could talk to. 

Now I've grown a lot as an engineer + teammate and I'm very appreciative of the experiences I've had, but work was really mentally and emotionally challenging this year. Luckily I received a new opportunity and will be starting mid next month, and from the sounds of it I won't be subject to the same kinds of external pressure. But who knows if I'll find myself in similar situations."
1065,cscareerquestions,What career should I pursue?,"I am a 14 year old who lives in the UK. I want to become a self taught dev but not sure what job to actually work towards. I recently started learning SQL with mySQL and really enjoy it. Therefore, I was researching on jobs around databases but they seem hard to get into with out a degree or decent amount of related tech job experience. I know front end web dev is one of the better options for my current situation but I dont enjoy it as much as working with SQL. I know a decent amount of python, lua, html and css (including all of this info if it may help you when trying to help me answer this question).

1066,cscareerquestions,How does someone get started?,"I am a CS minor with a major in computer networking and IT, but I never feel confident enough applying to software dev positions because I keep feeling like I dont have any legitimate experience. Is there a good way to help convince myself or employers that I have the experience nessecary?

I have years of experience in python, java, and c++, and now with this minor in CS, I feel a bit more comfortable with the web side of programming(html, php, javascript, sql, etc.), but I still feel like I shouldn't be looking towards the CS field since I majored in networking and IT. I'm more than willing to work for little pay to build up a record for myself, but I'm not quite sure where to begin with that. Does anyone have any recommendations of sites I can search through or entry level positions(generally) I could apply to? Most of my schooling has been a test to see if I could regurgitate all of the information I had been told, but none of it really helped me feel ready for practical application.

I'm at a point where I'm regretting going to college for networking, since I've always had a passion for making computers execute code. If I can use this degree to get my foot in the door and work from there, I would love to put these past years behind me and do something I not only enjoy, but also something I can do well.

1069,cscareerquestions,Advice on switching focus after 5 years programming with no education?,"I am wanting advice on how to change the focus of my programming career.

I've been an RPGLE programmer for the past 5 years for a single company. I am a couple decades under the average age of my coworkers who've been doing this since the 80s/90s. The age isn't a problem and I enjoy working with these people, but their skills haven't kept up with the times. I've helped modernize the way we do things, using SQL instead of the native I/O, switching from fixed format to free format coding, and modularizing programs where appropriate. Nothing revolutionary, but for this company it seems like I'm on the cutting edge.

**I am both underpaid and want to get back to modern programming.** I enjoyed creating stuff using .NET, Angular, HTML/CSS, etc. before taking this job. I don't know how to best make that transition after talking to fellow programmers outside of the workplace.

My original plan was to build back my web dev skills with a course I had purchased (about a month into learning right now) and then create my resume listing these newly acquired skills and link a GitHub with a couple good projects. One of these programmers believes I should just make the resume now and apply for the jobs I want without worrying about doing that course, because I can learn syntax on the job. I'm not concerned about the lack of education as I have a good amount of experience, but I do think that's just one less section to fill out my resume. Considering that and this being my only relevant job, I do worry my resume is going to look pretty bare and I'm not going to stand out amongst other applicants. I don't want to apply too early and then not get considered later as a result of getting passed over on the first attempt.

Any advice on the best path forward?"

1071,cscareerquestions,Transitioning from the Military to SWE?,"Hey all.

I'd love some advice from people in the SWE industry on best steps forward given my situation.

I'm currently an Officer in the Navy, 26 y/o. I did/do underwater EOD. I was coming up to the end of my obligatory service, but I signed up for four more years so that I could pursue grad school while employed. I'm about halfway done an applied thesis-based Masters in network security.

Honestly though, I  fell in love with SWE. I have had way too much time to practice on Leetcode/Codewars/AlgoExpert, and I really enjoy the problem solving process. But It just kind of feels like a dead end, because while most people have 1-4 months to grind LeetCode for an internship, I have like, 4 years. If I quit the military early, I'd owe back my salary + the obligatory service salaried time that I incurred, which would easily clear $150K.

I feel like by the time I hit the end of my contract, I'll probably be 30, and then I can start applying to internships.  That feels super old compared to a lot of guys and girls on this subreddit. Do you folks have any recommendations that I could act on to help the transition into SWE?"

1073,cscareerquestions,How should I reject an offer?,"I was job hunting and got an offer. However, my current employ gave me a raise and I decided to stay. What should I say to the company to reject the offer and ensure I can keep my connection with them?"
1074,cscareerquestions,Juggling multiple interviews,"Perhaps a stupid question, but how do you time when to apply to which vacancies and handle multiple interviews? 

For example, I was looking for an internship and took the advice to apply to a lot of vacancies. I applied to 22 in total. Some companies ghosted me, some rejected me, some sent me an assessment, some invited me to interview(s), etc. 

I disliked the timing. Some weeks I even had 3-5 interviews scheduled, it was exhausting since I also had other deadlines going on from school, part time jobs, current internship, etc.

In the end I landed an internship position (yay!) and accepted it. But then later I received from other companies that they wanted to interview me or that I got to the last/second round of interviews. 

At that point I felt so burned out that I withdrew from all of them. I already signed the contract so I couldn’t (and didn’t want to) back out and had no energy/time to prepare (- I don’t want to make a fool of myself). I also have a fear of failure and low self-confidence and esteem: in my eyes I always did something wrong and I would think that I failed / don’t make a chance. So that’s why I thought that I wouldn’t get invited (or even have been offered a position).

Even worse is that some of those last rounds of interview were from two FAANG companies and some other well-known companies. I feel that because of the way I handled the situation I missed my only chance to intern at those companies since I will graduate soon. 

Anyways since I cannot turn back time, I’m wondering how do I avoid making these types of mistakes when applying for jobs? Obviously some companies/positions interest me more than others and I would like to compare job offers too. But how do I do this when they only give me one week to accept/decline and the time of application process differs vastly per company?

I feel that I’m overthinking the situation.. I would be glad to receive some advise. Thank you 😊"
1075,cscareerquestions,I know it’s toxic to compare yourself to others but am I really cut out for this?,"I have started my first grad role, several months in and so far it has been a great experience the people are lovely and always willing to help if they have time. 

I also started with another grad who I get along with quite well and we collaborate a lot.

My issue is that I feel I add more problems than solutions sometimes, I may be focussing more on the the negative but all I can think about is my tech debt which is made worse when they have clients testing  out the app when I know there are cases where it could fail.

The other grad I work with seems to work out and write way better quality code than I do which is normal considering he may have more of an edge having a degree and more experience developing but I can’t help feel useless.

I have been working weekends to resolve my issues but just the amount of stress of handling tech debt and my current sprint is so tough. Is this normal? How do you manage it? I feel like I barely have time to learn in a two week sprint."
1076,cscareerquestions,Seniors what were the biggest mistakes in your career path?,"For context I never thought much about a career in CS, I was more interested in Music Tech to begin with. I built websites on the side to pay the bills whilst I was at college.

My first job was at a small web shop building WP sites and PHP applications. In 4 years I had almost no salary increases from my initial junior salary which doesn't compete with any junior salary nowadays. Despite becoming the lead programmer on every big project no rise in status or pay was given to reflect that. As this was my first job I was really naive to how much I was actually worth to them.

I went and got myself a CS masters and within 2 weeks I had 2 offers which doubled my salary at the time. My career since then has been an amazing journey with lessons learned. But I can't help wonder how many other people made similar mistakes to me when they first started out. Would love to hear your stories."

1079,cscareerquestions,"Junior web dev here. I think I need career advice, I am stuck.","I  have worked as a web dev/FE dev for almost 2 years after finishing a  boot camp. Work has been great so far but I've already been feeling  'stuck' for the past months. I've been working with React and Redux.  Building components and the front end side of small applications.  Everything back end or deployment related has been taken over by more  experienced engineers.

I really  feel like I want and need to advance. This is not happening at my  current employer. Quality's irrelevant, we have even stopped code  reviews, testing, not to mention the last tech advice I got from a  senior was months ago. Feels terrible. I can't become good at my craft  like this.

I am currently  finishing up side projects, I've been reading books (Functional  programming, eloquent JS, TS books, almost everything from Uncle Bob), I  started a docker course to get some basics in. Getting ready for take  off basically - as much as I can.

Now  here's my problem. I am not sure or experienced enough to actually know  what my next step is. I've been thinking ""Well, everything is better  than where I am now"". True, but is that a healthy enough attitude?

So far the hard criteria in regards to ""What do I actually want in a new job"" I have come up with are:

\- Normal workflows, i. e. tickets written by a PO

\- A fair salary (tbd)

\- Code reviews (so I can get better)

That's  it. When I drill down my question of ""What do I want"" to the bottom I  don't actually know what type of company would be most beneficial  (agency, service provider, small/big/long established company, is there a  certain number of senior devs that should work at the company), nor am I  certain what direction is most beneficial to advance in (more back end,  different framework, additional languages, more dev ops?).

I've  googled tons, I've read blogs, I feel everybody has a different opinion  and everything feels too noisy. Is there any particular advice anyone  could give as of what's best for a post-bootcamp-person to further their  career after successfully having started afterwards? Is there even a  right or wrong here or is it just preference and I should go for what I  want despite my lack of broad experience in this field?"
1080,cscareerquestions,Job hopping,"I've jumped between 3 different companies in the past 3 years, spent 5 months at the first one, just because it was my first job in a new country and it was a pretty bad fit, i just kind of took the first thing i was offered, which was a bad move.

The current role i'm in, it has been 10 months, it has its pros and cons, but i'm trying to focus on adapting inspite of the cons, the main one being that it's been switched to fully remote, and there's almost zero socializing/building relationships, which is important to me.

I’ll be taking some time off (try out some personal projects/ideas) and apply for a startup after some time. I believe I can tap my potential better that way.

I have recently taken interest in operating systems as a whole and started digging myself into the subject a bit more. Long story short, I have narrowed down what my field of work should be, and on of those is developing operating systems.

My question in general is what do I need to do, what do I need to learn in order to land a job like this and be good at it?

Here are my specific questions:

1. How much algorithm theory/data structures theory will I need? (EE courses are a bit lacking in this department.)
2. What other programming languages do I need besides C/C++?
3. I have done a bit of assembly and I love it. Should I spend more time diving into it? (I've heard that it's useful to know, but nobody actually uses it.)
4. How can I familiarize myself with operating systems and their structure? (Embedded OS-es will be touched on in whatever MSc course I'm going to take, but I want more and I want it now...)
5. Will I be able to get a job developing an OS straight out of university or are there some other boxes I'll have to tick before I actually get hired as an OS dev?
6. How deep should my knowledge of hardware be? Unit level? Logic gate level? Transistor level? Semiconductor level?

Here is what I have right now:

1. C/C++ and Verilog
2. Embedded hardware knowledge and understanding on the unit level. (I'm not sure where I'm at, but a lot of stuff is covered by the curriculum. I fell like I mostly need to expand software-wise.)
3. Basic understanding and usage of 8bit assembly. (I'm currently looking at getting something 32 bit assembly related done in January, once my exams are done.)
4. Python/Bash (Currently I work as a Python ""developer"" besides classes, I develop some GUI tool for Windows and Linux in the automotive industry.)
5. End user level Linux knowledge.

How do I expand upon these? Thank you for your help in advance!

I would like to understand how the implementation managers or project managers of Reddit would approach the question below?

""The City Hospital account has recently ran into a problem and needs your guidance on the path forward.

When the account sold, part of the deal included development of a new product feature to be included in the initial go-live, which is slated for 1 week from today. Unfortunately, Engineering just informed you that they’ve uncovered some bugs that will take 3 weeks to resolve. In addition, the City Hospital client team has already sent out communications to their executives and all frontline staff touting the upcoming release of the new feature, so you cannot postpone the launch.

Working with the Customer Success and Engineering, you’ve identified a few possible paths:

1. Since the bugs only occur when users perform specific tasks, those particular features can be disabled until the bugs are resolved. However, you also know that one critical Emergency Department workflow will be blocked by this option, affecting all 100 users in that area (40% of the total user base).
2. Engineering can reassign a few resources to tackle the bugs and shorten the timeline (allowing you to launch on time), but this will cause a 6 week delay in the already-late timeline to launch other features at the company's biggest client, St. Elsewhere. St. Elsewhere has been promised these features as part of an account remediation plan, with the contract set to renew next quarter.
3. The Data Integration team has stated that they can write a complex workaround that can be used until the bugs are fixed, but they won’t be able to fully test it until they get production data after go-live. In theory, though, this should prevent the bugs from showing to all end users until a permanent fix is in place.

**With all of these factors in mind, what path would you recommend, and why?** List any assumptions you make, and please be succinct with your answer; bullet format is acceptable."""

The company sets a high bar for its senior engineers, so this pivot is exciting, but daunting. I'm looking for advice on best ways to jump start the first few weeks at the new company *(in my case, in the entirely new engineering discipline).* A few things I have in mind:

* Get-to-know-you's (frontend, backend, product, project)
* HR process, IT access stuff, spin up a local environment &amp; test
* Review documentation / company wiki if it exists, else plan for myself or another to build it
* Understand the CI / CD tooling &amp; processes, i.e., from ready-to-push, on to prod
* Walk through the codebase, ask ""why this / that?"" Q's to understand methodology, tradeoffs, etc
* Get a feel for the code vs. PR review balance the team uses (or should use)
* Understand the product roadmap and lifecycle
* Start taking on stories &amp; code

([this the fragment](https://thingsthatmadeanimpression.wordpress.com/2013/02/03/excerpt-from-the-godfather-by-mario-puzo-thunderbolt/))

Ive been programming for around 5-7 years or so. Tried different languages, worked at different places, but none of them felt like ""this is it"". Id like to, I dont know, discover some passion for programming, but should I say its just gone? I never really enjoyed programming much. Sure, I was happy when stuff worked and angry/anxious if it didnt, but like, I cant even imagine meself doing other stuff, since this is pretty much the only thing Im ""good at"". Should I  just try different languages? Im already a jack of all trades, master of none when it comes to it.

Besides the questions at the beginning, Id like to ask - whats programming to you? Was this career path worth (excluding money)? Do you regret takin it and why? Can you imagine yourself doing something else? Was you striving to be better motivated by passion or money? Do you even like what youre doin?"

1111,cscareerquestions,Remote Support Engineer Help!," 

Hello everyone, I graduated about 3 months ago in CIS: Programming and I've been having some difficulty landing a job. I have an upcoming second round interview with a good company for a Remote Support Engineer position. Now its not exactly what I took the most of my time working in when I was doing my internship and previous work (most of what I've done is working in frontend or android development), but its better than running a damn pizza shop which I'm currently doing.

I was wondering if any of you would have some insight as to what kind of questions I should expect or anything I can study up on before the interview on Tuesday, since I've never really done any support work in the past."
1112,cscareerquestions,Is on-call worth it?,"Engineer at a company with an oncall. It's not very nice but whatever. The thing is other people at the company outside of our team don't have to do it and I don't think we get paid more for on call. It's very stressful as well, and happens around every 2 - 4 months for 1 - 2 weeks.

Can you guys share your on-call stories? Is this worth it?"
1113,cscareerquestions,Could I ask for an advance on my signing bonus upon successful completion of my background check if I begin work around 2.5 months from now?,"I am a \*very\* broke college student unable to pay rent for the next two months and I begin work in early February. The signing bonus is a lot: it's enough to pay off my student loans, credit card debt, and my rent for the next two months with a lot more to spare. I'm out of options to earn/get money elsewhere and I just really need to focus on finishing my classes right now. Also, my credit card is maxed out and I just don't want my credit score to go down either. 

Any advice on how to ask? What details to include / what's not necessary?"
1114,cscareerquestions,What is required to transition from sales to development?,"If I wanted to have a career change without a degree, what are the bare minimum qualifications and skills I would need to attain a €50k per year role."
1115,cscareerquestions,"What exactly is a sales engineer, how does one become one, and does it really pay more than being a software engineer?","I'm very new into my CS career, so this putting the cart well before the horse, but I'm curious to hear any thoughts/stories from sales engineers. I'm very extroverted, and all of my previous jobs heavily involved talking with people, and i think I'd be happier doing a more talk-heavy job than just sitting at a computer and writing code.

What does it take to become a sales engineer? How much of a sales background does one need? How much of a coding background?"
1116,cscareerquestions,"I got my pm in trouble. Feeling good about it, but nervous about the meeting that will happen because of it.","I'm a new software developer for a small company. I have 6 years of experience and I'm learning quickly. Three weeks ago, I was moved to a new project that was pretty early in development. The impression I got early on was that things were done hastily without much testing and the clients are starting to get pissed.

So here I am, the new guy, and I get some bugs in my queue. I start poking around and find the bugs are for features that were either never implemented or half done. I mentioned to the pm that I find it weird that we're X months into the project, and I'm finding stuff like ""login"" was never working as intended. Being the new guy, I kept my head down and just did what I do best. I keep getting bugs like this until I call up the pm and say ""we can't keep calling these items bugs if they were never implemented in the first place"". This led to an argument between us, and again I thought to myself, ""ok, I'm probably just not seeing the whole picture yet"". 

Fast forward to yesterday, I had a task that had an estimate of 8 hours. Task was super simple and took maybe 45 minutes for me (again, the new guy) to finish. When the pm asked me to explain my work, I showed him and he found a completely unrelated bug, and said I needed to fix it. I said ""sure, let's just create a bug task and I'll hop on it"". Again an argument with this tool. He was telling me that we're a team and we should just develop things as we find them. I pushed back and said no, we need to document what we're doing so we can actually work as a team. This was a solid 45 minute argument about what scope means. After some finger pointing, I said I'd rather talk to someone higher up and have a meeting between the three of us to work this out. He said ""go ahead, I won't go to that meeting"". So I left the call and started writing and email about all of the strangeness I've found.

Five minutes after I sent the email, I get a call from the vp of the company. Turns out he's been having trouble with my pm for a while and is very concerned about the project overall. He's been thinking of scrapping the project completely and starting over. Tasks are being promised but never completed. Time estimates for work is random and varies wildly. He's been questioning everything my pm has done over the last few months, way before I even interviewed for the company. To say the least, I was relieved that someone took my side.

So after all this is done, I received a notification about a mandatory 3 hour meeting on Monday morning to discuss the overall condition of the project. It felt really good to know that the higher ups are finding this stuff weird as well, and that someone has my back. I have no idea what I'm going to say at this meeting. I plan on keeping my head low. All I want to do is develop my stupid forms, and fix my stupid bugs while I listen to my stupid music... 

Tldr: my pm was being dumb. I told him stop being dumb or I'll tell on you. He said go ahead. I told on him and now we have a three hour meeting to discuss how dumb he is."
1117,cscareerquestions,HELP !! Career advice !,"I've been working in SAP support project for the last one year, I haven't learned anything significant (I was hoping that something would happen on it's own, maybe my TL would shift me to a different team, but it's hasn't happened). So a month ago I started working on my computer science fundamentals (DS &amp; Algo), MERN stack to get some full stack projects under my belt as I want to get into development domain (where atleast I'd do something significant, and I chose MERN because I had no better idea ). 

Working on data structures, and simultaneously learning MERN stack has been overwhelming for me, and I already have an ""experience"" of 1 yr which amounts to zilch, my friends are moving to better companies, getting pay hikes, and I'm learning software development to get into software development. I keep thinking, what if it's too late for me to make a switch (I know it's not, but I still can't get this thought out of my head), I've had trouble sleeping because of all of this.

It would take me 4-5 months if I work my ass off, to learn things that I want to, and then maybe I'd be change my domain, and then I've to start from the beginning itself. This thought itself makes me anxious plus also there's this possibility that recruiters might not consider my experience (given my non-technical support nature of work at my current organization ). So should I skip the nature of my work from my resume or perhaps replace it with something related to what I'm learning right now?"

I am a software engineer from Bangladesh and have been working in the cloud sector for around 1 years. This allowed me to know the hardware and software details of a cloud infrastructure and I am more interested in the DevOps world now. Although I know DevOps is all about experience.

Now my query is, if I want to land a software engineering job at Canada, what should be efforts? I am asking about Canada because I have some family ties there (not citizen) and therefore I would like to move there. One way is to get into Grad School but it's quite a long time to finish and therefore I prefer getting a job offer and move there. So, with this bit of experience and some problem solving experience in my undergrad, what should I do now to get a job offer from Canada? I would like to know if there's any specific process that I should follow or it's just all about my experience and Leetcode skills that's going to get me there?

1124,cscareerquestions,"I feel like every second I’m not grinding is a waist of time. Please help, my life is being consumed.","Graduated in May of this year and I have been on the job hunt since. I have no internships and no big projects aside from a react native mobile app for my capstone course. 

I have been on a non stop grind for 4-5 months now. Everyday I sit down and I try to expand my skills or get better at LC. I started off so hot being able to do 8-10 hrs a day, for like 2 months and then 4-6 hours and now I can’t do more than 2-3 hrs of net productivity in a day. I’m so burnt out but I keep trying. I find motivation in some of these posts to keep going and not give up so here I am.

Every day is so mundane and repetitive. I’m sitting for 10 hours a day trying to stay focused and motivated and continuously learning because for some reason I feel like any second I’m not grinding a leetcode problem or learning a new skill I’m wasting my time. This is ruining my relationships with other people and it’s turning me into a depressed zombie. 


I fixed up my resume and improved response rate from 3-5% to 8-10%.

I’m trying to change my mind set and reclaim my life. Today I refuse to touch my computer, and I will also try to tomorrow. 

Do you think it’s worth going down this road any longer? I feel like it’s a dead end, and I’m prolonging the inevitable. I really enjoy programming and particularly front end web dev. I don’t care where I land I just want my foot in the door, but idk. I feel like giving up on this and maybe revisiting it at a later time in life. But I chose a “high paying job” because I want to help a lot of people in my life, especially my mom who will become completely dependent on me and my siblings in a  few years.


Sorry for the long post, it feels good to spill out my thoughts here to a bunch of strangers bc I am very superficial and surface level with everyone I personally know. But I am also looking for advice on how to manage my mind set.

Should I give up this grind? To those who did, what did you end up working as? To those who didn’t, what helped you get through it?

My job hunt strategy is cyclic. I grind for ~1 month on a skill or something and then over a week I send out like 50-60 apps. Then I manage those interviews (whatever comes up) and then go back to grind again and repeat. I do not send out apps consistently but I’m about 300-350 apps in at this point. I do not send out apps to job descriptions I am clearly under qualified for. 


Any advice and tips or anything is appreciated. Hope you are all doing well."

1126,cscareerquestions,Finding a route into CS for late career switcher,"I'm 38, currently in my 10th year as a public high school Language Arts teacher in a medium/high COL area. For all the reasons you might imagine (read the gory details of the profession on r/teachers), I'm ready for a change. 

I am the sole earner for my family (mortgage, student debt, 2 young kids, etc), so I feel like I can't afford to quit my job to go back to school for a CS degree full time, but it would take forever to do part-time classes while trying to maintain my teaching job. I have a BA in Applied Linguistics (which is helpful for understanding the syntax of programming) and a Masters in teaching ESL (a lot of good that does me...), but no formal CS training. I've recently started learning Python using on-line resources like Codecademy and other online courses. I really like the learning process, and am fascinated by coding and development process in general. I'm still so new to the CS world that I haven't even really picked a specialty yet, so I'm just spending a lot of time reading through posts here and practicing coding on my own. Many years ago I had fun creating websites and doing some graphic design work, so I'm familiar (but rusty) with some html and UI/UX practices. I'm fairly tech-savvy on my own, but not what you would call a l33t haxx0r. My years of teaching have likely given me more soft-skills than your average codemonkey, so I hope that will be an asset in my job search. I'd rather not do a purely customer-facing role, but I'm open to the possibility of running interference between clients and engineers if it lands me a decent gig. Even better if I can land a hybrid or permanently remote job (I personally loved the switch to online teaching during the pandemic, even though it was a hot mess for students). 

I know the debate rages on about getting a CS degree vs doing a bootcamp, but I feel like a summer bootcamp between school years is my best/only real option.  Anyone want to chime in on why I should consider doing the degree route instead? Is it worth my time to do a bootcamp when I don't even know what I want my focus to be? I don't necessarily need to climb the FAANG ladder to be a bazillionaire, but I want a role that will afford us a comfortable lifestyle, help send my kids to college, and allow me to have time with my family and not work ridiculous overtime. 

Do I need to pick a specialty at the beginning of my journey? What's the best way to investigate the actual day-to-day duties and routines of different jobs so I can figure out what will be the best fit for my aptitudes and interests? I currently planning to learn Python &gt; Java &gt; SQL, but are there other languages I should learn first? I'm feeling the pressure to get myself on track for self-teaching while I prepare for a summer bootcamp, and I want to make a smart plan.

Thanks for your input on what must seem like just another boilerplate help post, but feels like my professional life is at stake :)"
1127,cscareerquestions,Can you make up for lack of CS efficiency with skills in the mathematics / problem solving in more math heavy fields such as computer vision?,"All the coding I have learned (Python &amp; Matlab) has been independent since college as I graduated with Mechanical Engineering. There's no doubt in my mind CS majors can fabricate more efficient code due to their formal knowledge on memory allocation, but I'm pretty good at implementing math &amp; theory into programs. Like actually writing decent Python code too, not 'engineer' code. In fact, being able to solve difficult math problems is the thing that initially sparked my interest in CS (I *love* math).

The issue is that I'm not sure if I can promise to be able to write super optimized industry ready Machine Learning or Computer Vision algos right of the bat since a lot of my previous professional work has mainly been writing 'get it to work and we're moving you onto the next project' image processing programs. I try my best to optimize code, but I can forget to vectorize data or use a generator. I'm not well-versed in best practices.

1129,cscareerquestions,Is this normal for a company to operate this way?,"tl;dr; Is anything in the dot points normal for a 15+ year old business?

I've recently started a new job as a lead dev/project manager at a long running company (15+ years), and having worked at a few companies in my carrier, though never as a manager. Coming into this I ran into some weird conditions, these include:

* The devs develop in VMs, which they rdp into from a jump box ... which they too rdp into.
   * For context I know this is a standard way of handling production systems in some way, but for the machines the developers develop on
* The Dev VMs are underpowered (given 2 cores and 4Gb ram for Windows 10), this results in constant VM issues
* The VMs are effectively air gapped, as in no internet access outside of their own isolated network, which incurs some weird overheads:
   * Our product literally relies on the internet for 95% functionality, so testing requires constant releases to either staging or prod
   * No build/dependency management systems can be used(yes there are ways around this like using nexus\\achiva but these haven't been used/thought of)
   * Any new libraries the devs need, need to be found online, provided to the infrastructure team, who ask a list of questions for security (the questions they ask could be better), then download them and copy them into the developers environment (yes this is we need to find ALL the dependencies) 
* They don't use any build system (so no ant/ivy, maven, sbt, gradle, bash script of any kind)
* No CI/CD system of any kind
* No review code review system beyond ""does it do what it needs to"", which means the obvious case of horrible, poorly written spaghetti code over multiple poorly defined services (with virtually no kind of automated testing)
* A super paranoia about source code theft
   * This is pushed by the company owner who developed it originally but hasn't touched it in a long time, and has changed considerably from it's inception apparently
   * It isn't that ""clever"", and we have numerous competitors in our industry.
   * It is all locally hosted (in that private developer network)
   * We all sign contracts to the effect of ""you steal it we'll take your house, car, and your income for the next 100 years"", like every other company
* No one knows how to get any of the systems running from scratch, as in for a new developer to get their first code working, they need a copy of production that they then config to point to local data sources.
* Everyone on the company is on a single JIRA project, from accounting, to sales, to developers, to legal.
* The source relies on libraries nearly a decade old (as in libraries  that were last updated over a decade ago)
   * I recognize that upgrading spaghetti code on a system you have to manually find dependencies on, with a system you can't build from scratch is likely the culprit, but no one seems to care.
* There is no clustering, and servers are pets and not cattle, which feels weird in todays environment.
* They don't use Git
* Releases to production are all manual, and done explicitly by infrastructure by copy pasting individual files.
* There is excessive policy documents that need to be signed and filed with HR including beyond the normal device release, HR policy stuff you sign with any new company, like:
   * JIRA usage policy
   * Code Release policy
   * Company expectation policy
   * Manager expectation policy
   * Performance Tracker policy
   * .etc
* There is an inherent resistance to change with the thought of ""it's not broken, so it's fine"", ignoring that in the short tenure I've been there (less then 3 months), there have been several major incidents that impacted all our customers.
* Near 0 documentation (I am not kidding, maybe a dozen 2 page word file that are mostly screen shots for process stuff)

The question I want to know is, what of this list of craziness is weird and not, am I overly sensitive, have I just worked for bad companies? is this is normal?

Any feedback would be appreciated as I am looking to quit due to being unhappy at working 10 - 12 hour days trying to slowly document the system, understand what half the codebase does, write up proposals to start moving towards what seems ""normal"", write up standards guides, and just make what I'm working in not seem terrible."

So far, things have went pretty good overall and my workplace has a great atmosphere in terms of my co-workers and managers. About 3 weeks ago, the employer offered to extend the contract by 1 year (I'm not an FTE). While it's nice that they want my services, I think I could be doing better in terms of pay. However, I don't have the level of SWE experience (only from this job) nor the counter job offers (I've been discreetly applying for jobs for the past month) to leverage a better pay.

My contract expires this week and I'm really stumped on what to do. Should I risk it and ask for a raise? Should I try to get another year under my belt?

1142,cscareerquestions,Career changes reality check,"There's a bit more background to this question than is probably necessary but, bear with me.

I'm 43. I've had a variety of jobs in management, sales, service since leaving college. For the last decade I have bartended and waited tables. Frankly, the hourly pay is fantastic. I make about 50k a year when I work.

My wife and I generally only work on average 6 months a year the last 5 years. We are very lucky. We sold everything, bought a nice large sailboat and have zero debt, nearly zero bills beyond cell phones, wifi, food and boat maintenance. So, we work, save up a ton of money fast, then travel, either via the boat to Bahamas and Caribbean or via car or plane elsewhere jn the world until the money runs out and wash rinse repeat.

This is good. It works. 

However, its a physically demanding job that requires being in one place to work and can't work while traveling. 

Also, frankly, my body is starting to feel its age and long shifts on my feet are getting hard, and 5 years from now maybe impossible.

So. Thanks to advancing technology and covid and more progressive thinking among companies compounded with high demand for tech workers, it seems there is a strong market for remote tech workers.  

I'm going to work through the busy season starting here now, by spring ill have enough money to live off for a year and pay for a reputable coding boot camp(13 to 20k). In the meanwhile, i bought a good macbook pro, and a subscription to code academy. I'll be able to complete thier whole selection through the winter and between that and self study be ready for a coding bootcamp.

I grew up with computers. My first was a Vic20 with a cassette tape as storage medium. Moved on, installed and ran BBSs running banks of 2400 baud modems. Coded in basic, pascal(yes, I'm old) scripting in *unix, C and in the late 90s early 2000s, c+. The vast majority of my stuff was for fun. I always enjoyed the logical process of taking complex tasks and boiling them down to the simplistic yes/no basic steps. I wrote software for fun, I enjoyed it and was quite good at it for the time period.  Did some basic coding for MUDs(if you know what that is you're also old and sorry for those lost hours of your life). 

My goal would be to be able to land a remote job in the field.  Because of our circumstances, lack of debt and very low cost of living, I don't need to make 120k a year and stock options in silicon Valley, if I can get a job that pays 35k+ a year, build a portfolio and do some freelance work I'd be very happy and consider the time and money well invested. 

So, the question is, without a degree, how realistic is 35k/year remote work only?

I got an offer at XXX (well-known company) as a Backend Dev Intern, but within the first two weeks I started my mentor quit. During the interview, I was promised I'd be taught all I needed. This promise was never delivered. I was completely lost because the product I work on has little documentation. I dug into the department's docs and all I found is a bunch of very old powerpoints that advertise the product to the customer. I found some recorded presentations that talk about some of the classes in the code but they were very poorly presented, so much incoherent rambling and definitely not comprehensible for someone just starting out. The shit show continued until I got assigned to a customer support case. I got confused why I need to do support when my title was a backend developer. I couldn't even debug the customer's error because I had no clue how it fits within the product. Heck, I wasn't even sure how to use the product. The codebase is tremendous (&gt;1000 classes) with each class averaging 100-200 LOCs. Little Javadoc or UMLs. When I complained this is not what I got hired to do, I was told debugging customer problems is the first step to learning the product and doing dev work.

I struggled, researched, and self-learned for a month and finally I have a much better grasp over how-to-use, which classes to focus on in the code and which to ignore, how the product is configured, common problems faced by customers, potential bugs, and etc. I was able to add some minor enhancements to the product. Now I can confidently tackle customer issues (which tend to be configuration errors 99% of the time). 

Now I am getting paged most of the time to work on customer cases. Heck I sometimes had to join calls to help customers with production-down issues only to find out they have third-party service crash or firewall errors. I feel like I am not growing as a software developer and none of this will make me hireable as s SWE/SDE. I rarely get a chance to work on enhancenents because customer cases have a higher priority. 

It is even worse that our project does not have a product manager who I can reach to get user stories to develop, etc. We don't have a DevOps team either. You just think of an enhancement, create a git issue, add it to the In Progress column, write the code in a feature branch, make a PR to the dev branch, add a reviewer who knows about the part of the product which you are enhancing, and wait till forever to get a code review. No deadlines. Oh, and if you can you also add your own unit tests.

The more I work here, the more worried I get about my experience. It is very irrelevant and does not help me grow. How will I be ready after I graduate? So recently I told my coop office I want to quit, but I was told they would fail me in the coop program because I had accepted the job offer to work for 16 months. I have been applying for summer 2022 opportunities but I am yet to get an interview. I recently talked to my manager about internal transfer and he/she sounded disappointed because I was filling the void for them in closing customer cases. 

Am I right in quitting and finding other opportunities? Would staying be a good idea if I am getting stellar reviews from coworkers and management but not learning and growing as a SWE?"

1155,cscareerquestions,Take-Home Assignment Anxiety,"Hi everyone, 

Reposting this from the r/CSMajors subreddit. 

After a short time applying for internships and getting some interviews - now a take home assignment is getting to me. 

For context, I am a freshman who have done some react projects in the past and yet for this one I’m struggling really hard as to what I should be doing, as majority of my time has been spent in tutorial hell and not what I personally want to create. 

The take home assignment seem to be sent as a rolling application type of thing, so in a way, it’s more to do with chances, just like how I did it with Google Kickstart competition. The objective is simple enough - create a social media application using a backend API and some front end framework. I am not going to discuss the company nor whose backend API I will be using, as I fear that might be a bit of a dox, which I refuse to do. 

I guess my question is - is it ok to not do it immediately, but to do it after a head start and planning on what I can do ? Is it ok to use outside resources a lot (I’ve used react documentations as well as other framework documentations before to create my applications) ? Is it ok to be completely stumped as to what I should and can be doing ? 

I wish to succeed within this internship, and I’d like some advices from past and former members who have done this before."

For example, first interview I was close to getting the “trick” and he helped me talk through that area and understand better where I was heading.

On the next one I mentioned a few approaches, got stuck and asked if he had any advice and he said to try out the data structure I mentioned in one of the approaches. Immediately saw the way to go from there.

It’s just so damn hard to tell and I really want to know if I have a chance haha. It’s even harder most companies don’t give feedback, so it’s tough to tell my true performance compared to an average candidate."

1158,cscareerquestions,[Vent] I screwed up my career and need some reflection/feedback,"I've been unemployed for many months (feel too guilty to tell you exactly how long it has been). After an unsuccessful period of job hunting I got depressed and lost. On paper i have two years of experience, but i have no actual development experience to back it up. 

I got my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, then  managed to get my first job at an IT consulting company as a junior application developer. However, it was a waste of time. Basically the company was like a retirement home, and i didn't do much of anything. My second one was at a big tech company. Although I was good enough at leetcoding to get the job, my actual software engineering skill became a constant source of my insecurity. Months would passed by and I fell behind the team in term of performance. Mostly I remember feeling sick having to work remote for months without doing anything else due to covid. Everyday I was dreading to get out of bed to see what i have to do next. I didn't know how to reach out online for support. Eventually i left after almost a year without a plan. It wasn't a happy decision, and I didn't gain any development experience either,, as they were mostly working on  maintaining their micro services. 

At this point I am considering getting a second degree in CS or going through a bootcamp. I hate how much that will cost but can't find the motivation to do anything on my own. I think the biggest problem is my insecurity about my lack of skill. I can't stop feeling discouraged when i try to apply for jobs without meeting over half of the qualifications, and failing interviews.

I am also considering to move to a large city, namely Austin, hoping to change my environment for a better mood. I worry about how i would support myself. I am very introverted and afraid doing hourly waged, customer service jobs that are common out there. Not to mention I imagine i would get weird looks from people who see someone who spent two years as a SWE to work as hourly wage worker? I have a lot of shame around my situation. I thought about freelancing, but i don't have the skill nor confidence to build an app on my own, and the freelancing market doesn't seem beginner friendly. I thought about open source too, but still i don't find anything beginner friendly. In the end, i believe what i need are skill, motivation and support, and i am having a hard time finding those. In the meantime, i've been seeking professional help locally. 

I don't know if the problem is me, or if my experience resonates with others. I'd like to hear any feedback on what i am missing or advice on what i can do now to get better.

Thank you for reading."
1159,cscareerquestions,"I’ve just joined a new company a month ago and they’ve given me a lot more responsibilities than I thought I’d get. I’m a bit scared I’m not fit for the job, or somehow about to fail them.","I have 8 YOE, Eastern Europe. I’m in outsourcing and a month ago joined a company as a senior developer but would make my way to principal engineers team in a year. That’s what they call the team which is kind of “all-over-the-place” and which works on a company level rather than project level. For example I would take on presages engineering for new leads, new projects for existing clients, help where needed… you get the picture.

I thought I’d initially join a project and gradually take on more work, yet in the first month I’ve been assigned a lead on a completely new project for new POs on one account, and I’ve been assigned a lead on a project for some huge new client that the company was trying to get for ages. And it’s a “phase 1 in a three-phase plan” which would result in a project of 60-70 people. The significance of the job, especially for the second one, is huge and not something that should be taken lightly. Yet they gave it to me and said to handle it when I’ve been here only for literally 4 weeks.

I have no problem with giving this type of work a go if needed, and it’s exactly what I want to do for the company, but I’d really rather shadow someone more experienced for a while and then take it on. 

I’d be lying if I didn’t say I’m scared sh*tlles that I’ll fail, it is my first “task” with them. I want to make a good impression and prove I’m worth the pay but the pressure in my first month is overwhelming at times. 

Anyway I think I’m probably overreacting a bit while writing this thread, but I just wanted to ask if anyone has an advice on what I could do or a similar experience to share. 

Thank you!"

When I applied to internships for this summer, I had listed Spring 2023 as my graduation date and mentioned on my resume and during interviews that I had planned on doing the masters program next year.  I received an offer to a summer 2022 internship with a dream company of mine and signed it. But a few weeks later, I found out I wasn't accepted into the Masters program at my school, so I will have to graduate in Spring 2022. 

My concern is that these internships are usually given with the assumption that interns are currently still enrolled full time after the internship ends. I'm afraid that if I mention I've already graduated and don't plan on returning to school, or if they ask for proof of enrollment for the subsequent semester, my internship will be rescinded. 

 I could of course just drop a class or two off my schedule so I won't graduate until Fall 2022, but I would like to avoid unnecessarily delaying my graduation. My hope is to complete the internship, and if I'm given a full time offer starting the next summer, I can just use the free time in between off to travel or work a different job until I can start the full-time offer.

1166,cscareerquestions,"Fresh grad, poor student, extreme social anxiety + depression","TL;DR: How do I get out of a defense contractor job when I'm unmarketable and always want to die?

Rant follows.

\----

Hey all,

I've been struggling with depression for about a decade. I have an expressive language disorder which makes it extremely difficult to talk to people. Social anxiety and loneliness tanked my grades and it took me 5 years to get a Bachelor's. I did not make a single friend in college despite small attempts to do so. I failed out of multiple classes and ended with a sub-3.0 GPA. I was always two steps behind my peers. Everyone else seemed like a well-adjusted young adult, I was basically a maladjusted NEET that somehow stumbled into a degree after breaking a leg. I'm not passionate about anything, so I didn't learn any of the modern tech that's used in the private sector. I took a software engineering class in college -- couldn't keep up with my peers, couldn't understand the technology, and wasn't motivated enough to learn it. I eventually withdrew because I was scared they would judge me as I was -- worthless -- and that only made it worse. Failed out. Five months ago, a defense contractor hired me right off college without a single coding question. I thought at the time that I'd struck gold.

I hate it here. Everyone's a boomer. I hardly communicate with anyone. It's extremely lonely and boring and I don't fit in. The military culture is dogshit, the pay is $65k (has nice retirement benefits -- but I'm only 24, so it's hard for me to grasp). People come here to retire and die. They're trying to stick me on Ada, I've been quietly tiptoeing around it because the IDE is 20 years old and is hardly functional. The waterfall model fucking sucks, and requirements aren't everything when it comes to code quality, but they don't realize that. My manager is incompetent and actively forces me to contribute to the egregious tech debt within the small Java project I'm currently working on. Way too much red tape for every little change, which stifles any kind of individual talent the government manages to pick up. The reason my ADHD-ass brain was drawn to computer science -- complex problem solving -- is resolved instead by the rampant copying and pasting of code.  My manager says that's just how coding should be, and it ""can't be fun all the time."" So, I'm unproductive as hell. The security clearance forces me to wake up early and work there with no phone and a relatively long commute time. I'm mentally exhausted and frustrated each time I come home because of how poorly my time is being used. Every single day I arrive like 30 minutes late because I don't have the passion to care about what I do. I'm isolated enough and deadlines are so non-existent that I could probably not show up for a week and nobody would notice. That's an exaggeration.

I want to transition to a job that I actually enjoy -- the private sector, most likely -- but I'm just a medium-sized fish in a small pond. When it comes to interviews, I clam up, my mind goes blank, and due to poor self-esteem I cannot advocate for myself. The pressure of an upcoming interview makes me anxious enough to induce constant suicidal thoughts from the moment the interview date is set to even after it has passed, which makes it impossible to prepare for them. I've done two in total. In the midst of an interview, I couldn't recall information even if I knew it, let alone being confident in my answer. I can't problem solve, I can't speak. I don't know social norms, and I come off as awkward and anti-social. Yes, I've got a therapist and antidepressants, but it's been like this for as long as I can remember. So in that regard it feels like nothing helps.

I've wanted to leave for months, but I can't seem to put in the effort required. I can't just spam job interviews, either, because they make me want to kill myself and I don't have what companies are actually looking for. LeetCode, React, actual software engineering concepts, even a GitHub account -- I know none of it. I never cared about personal projects, and now that I'm coding every day I don't have the energy to create one in my spare time. I feel dumb and slow and I have to Google everything. The longer I stay here, the more my skills degrade, the more I fall behind the curve. Nothing I do is meaningful in modern-day applications. Almost none of the work I do I can even put on a resume because they're using me so terribly. I'm drowning and I don't know how to escape. These are supposedly the prime years of my life and I've hated every second of them. Not exactly a life I'm excited to continue living.

So what the fuck do I do? Any advice at all would be appreciated here."

1173,cscareerquestions,Is counteroffering with +20% too high?,"I have an offer for a senior developer role at a financial company for £92k, plus 20-30% bonus, and +10% to take in benefits. I haven't negotiated so far; the £92k number was just stated in the offer I got from the recruiter.

My current salary is £85k and the recruiter is aware of that. I would have tried to avoid disclosing it, but my previous boss works at the company I'm applying to so it didn't seem worth trying to keep it secret. Last year my bonus was 35%, and I'm not sure whether they know that. 

I think they're very keen on me. My previous boss is high up in this company and apparently I was his first choice for this role. I've pretty much fast-tracked the interview process. I had one hour-long conversation and got an offer. I was told by the recruiter (so could easily be BS) that it's usually 6 interviews.

There's a bit of a problem with the timing of the move. Because my bonus there would be pro-rata, I'd only get about half, depending exactly when I join. I've done the maths and think I'd be making a net loss over the first \~6 months with their current offer. Their bonus is paid Jul 1, so up to and including that, I'd make about £60k for that period by moving, and about £68k by staying. (assuming they pay the low end of that range - would you ever give a new guy the maximum possible bonus? I doubt it - and my current job paid a 30% bonus).

I've already raised that issue with my previous boss, and asked about the possibility of a signing bonus to bridge the gap and he said it wasn't possible, and that the only room to negotiate is on salary.

I'm thinking of countering with £110k, which is just shy of 20% more than they offered. It would put me on £71k for that same period, which is slightly more than I'd get by staying. Obviously, over the long haul it's quite a lot more.

Is that a reasonable counter? Realistically, I think I'd take £100k, but probably more hopeful of settling on £105k.

Or do I go even higher? I worry that if I'm trying to use the pro-rata bonus situation as leverage then choosing a number that made my pay over that period significantly higher would weaken that argument. Thoughts?"

Currently working on Azure synapse with the job of data transformtaion using pyspark. It was easy for me as i have previously worked with data transformation using python.

So where i am stuck is deciding with path to choose for:

* Software Developer - start grinding dsa on a daiy basis and try moving to a product based company

* Cloud Developer or Data Engineer - My current role seems good. With the time i have at hand i can master azure cloud the most i can.

So are there oppotunities for Data engineer or cloud developers with 1 year experience that's as rewarding as SDE in a product based companies."
1182,cscareerquestions,What to study BESIDES Leet Code?,"I am a solutions architect and tech lead with 7 YOE, located in the US.

&amp;#x200B;

I finally decided that I'm missing out on some $200k+ per year salaries, and though I love my current job, I only make mid six figures, with no bonus/stocks. I am aiming for 200 - 300k base per year wherever I land. Goal is to up my total comp enough retire within 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, I started the Leetcode grind, and plan to apply to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and some other ""FAANG-like"" top tier companies. I have internal recruiter contacts at all the FAANGs. I realize LeetCode is a part of this, so I am doing 2ish problems a day for the next 2-4 months (mix of easy medium hard but focused on medium/hard). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am taking courses on Udemy that are FAANG prep and walk through how to approach these problems, and am learning very quickly (no CS degree, but know DS/A well enough from my grad degree in a similar field). I'm also pretty good at system design due to my architect role and lots of practice through Udemy and other resources.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, how else can I prepare? I understand there will be behavioral and solution architecture portions aside from Leet Code....but what about other tech knowledge?

&amp;#x200B;

Where should I expect to be asked about stuff like

\- OOP vs functional programming

\- Specifics of a language/framework on my resume

\- Random SQL questions like SQL vs NoSQL and other ""trivia""

\- etc..

&amp;#x200B;

Will this non-Leetcode tech phase happen in the phone screens or what? Basically, when does the stuff that usually is asked in a non-Leetcode compnay, asked at a FAANG?

&amp;#x200B;

Should I just google around for ""top React interview questions"" etc for the languages and frameworks I know and use? I already plan to go through my Resume and list details of each thing I include, refresh on topics, and answer mock questions I may get ""think of a time when..."". 

&amp;#x200B;

I get that a lot of this will be discussed during the system design portion, such as tradeoffs between technologies, ways to scale, partitioning, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks all"

I am a new grad, I’ve been working as a Systems Engineer at a large company for just over 3 months now. I was doing okay at first, but there have been many changes lately that have impacted me: my manager (they were perfect) quit, the person training me moved to a new team (now she is unresponsive and rude, and she is the only one who can help me for certain things I am stuck on), and my mentor/person I really connected with has quit yesterday. Yesterday, I also found out that I will be on call (24x7) for 1 week a month which includes holidays (our company doesn’t have holidays off) and weekends. I’m working 10 hours a day + some weekends. I’m on call the week of thanksgiving and the week of New Years. 

I also just feel lost, I feel like I’m not as smart or useful as the rest of or what’s left of the team. I can’t stop thinking or worrying about getting fired. However, my main concern is everyday for the last two weeks I wake up and cry, I have to set aside extra time in the morning to cry - the only time I’m not thinking about work is when I’m sleeping and the anxiety is disturbing my sleep so I barely even sleep or am woken up thinking about work. 

I’ve only been here for 3 months, this isn’t enough time for my resume and it’s all I’ve got, I also need the money - any advice would be appreciated."
1184,cscareerquestions,CS work for extroverts? I'm 10 years into my career and feeling burnt out.,"Hey,  


I'm 29 years old and have been coding professionally 10 years at this point. I've noticed I consistently get burnt out and bored with my jobs, specifically when I don't get to interact with other people. It makes me reach a point where I'm doing the bare minimum effort wise, which feels bad and puts my coworkers in compromising positions.   


Anyone else feel this way, and did you find a CS job that worked for you? I'm currently looking at new jobs and want to make sure I pick something I feel excited to stick with.

E**xamples of things I've loved:**  
\- Pair programming with a co-worker as we knock out a challenging feature together

\- People coming to me directly with feature requests, we get excited scoping them out, and I get to deliver it personally to them &lt;24 hours later

\- Being asked to design how a feature works, coming up with something strong, and showing it off a week later

&amp;#x200B;

**Things where my motivation reaches zero:**

\- Supporting a system that has a new bug every day/week, the client and I are both just groaning and done with it, or the client is in a state of entitled anger, OR I am just delivering it to my project manager each week who gives a quick ""thanks!"" in an e-mail, then I don't even meet the client

\- Being given tasks with long, lazy deadlines, and I report back to my PM once a week/month with some BS excuse about why I haven't gotten much done. Even if it's secure, easy, and allows me to slack of, I just end up hating myself for how unproductive and unmotivated I am (an off hand thought here is to take the lazy job and fit my own side hustle within working hours...)  


Appreciate anyone's insight. Thanks!"

Of course, the state of the company has shifted multiple times over the pandemic, causing leadership to “push back” the promotion that was promised to me. 

I’ve been on the job hunt for a few months now, which is really easy thanks to being remote. However, whenever I’m presented a coding challenge (leet code, white board, etc) I found myself unable to answer even the most basic questions. I’ve also been re-watching coding tutorials on YouTube and doing some daily coding challenges to help keep my skill set in check, but I feel like I’m not getting anywhere (tutorial hell).

Nowadays, I’m finding myself unmotivated. It’s hard to get started first thing in the morning, but I feel like if I don’t keep learning something new and building things, I’m never going to get anywhere.

I got the job but I’m wondering if this is actually a good stepping stone to maybe becoming a Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Financial Analyst. I’m worried that the title “Data Specialist” is too close to “Data Entry Specialist” which is not nearly as impressive on a resume.

At the moment I'm registered on the MEng course. I'm also considering MSc courses and I think I'd have a chance at getting into another uni such as Oxbridge, Imperial, UCL, or Edinburgh.

While I've seen the advice that which university you go to doesn't matter, I've looked through people on LinkedIn with roles which interest me and they seems to heavily favour Oxbridge and Imperial. I've also discussed this with my 3rd year project advisor who also suggested it would be a good thing to consider.

The cost of doing this would be quite high for me, at about £20,000 out of pocket for the year, whereas if I stay where I am I'll end up saving money.

Since I believe the course would be more enjoyable and the career prospects (including internationally) would be better because of the branding of those universities, I'm currently on the side of doing it. What does reddit think?"

Three years ago i new nothing about programming, like zero knowledge, most high schools atleast teach html, and i used to skip most of them. And because of that i came in completely clueless, where else most of my classmates knew a little bit of programming, now despite skipping classes and regularly hanging around with my foolish friends i was still a straight A student, which made it much worse for me mentally, not knowing a single thing about programming. So because of that from the First year till now i've been working my butt of learning, learning, and catching up to the rest of them and finally I had got my first full time job back last summer, just after my 6th semester finals and i was to start in Winter next year.

But my bitchy ass university won't allow me to join them, cause like you can't answer finals if you are not a full time student, which, if I take the job that would make me a part time student and some other BS they keep on spouting.

What makes me more angry than anything else is that, they already started advertising, using my face, as an example of 100% job guarantee if new students join their college. Like, they just don't give a shit now, it sincerely pisses me off.

1221,cscareerquestions,Discussion - When and you should change your job?,"*This is approved by mods.*

Hello everybody, I recently wrote a post on my blog that might be interesting to you. And I want to start a discussion and get your point of view on this thing. I will just paste the content of that post.

## Introduction

Changing job usually is not something that most people enjoy. You need to find a better job, apply to it, prepare for an interview, do a couple of interview rounds, sometimes solve a task and then talk about a salary. This can be a tiresome, time-consuming, and frustrating experience. But I would say it is worth it. As somebody who is at 4th company in the last five years, I can speak from my experience. 

## Decide what is important for you

This is probably the most important thing - decide what your job means to you and how much of your life you want to spend on it. We are all different and we all have different life goals.

I know some people are ok with working in an entry-level job for more than a couple of years without any big promotion. People like that are happy with the salary they have because they can afford what they need, they are happy that it is eight hours office job. Many people would say that it is unambitious. But if they can pay their bills and afford what they want then it is great. For them, the job is just a way to get money to do some other stuff that interests them.

On the other hand, I also met people who work more than eight hours a day, and most of the time they only talk about the job. It seems like that job is their whole identity. Those people are promoted very often, have great status in the company they work for, they are kind of 'famous' and recognizable in some circles that are related to the job,  and I would say it boosts their self-esteem. I respect that kind of person because I doubt I could do that for a long time. 

At the start of my career up to around three years later, I had three things that were important to me. When I was looking for a job in that period I was looking for those three things at every company that I applied for. 

That three things are: **I wanted to work with modern and relevant technologies.** Since I am a web developer I mostly wanted to work with Java and Spring Boot. I was ok with working with Python but Java was my main priority. 

Second thing is that **I wanted to be a part of some kind of product team that develops new features.** That way I knew I would learn something new and get a lot of experience. I did not want to maintain some old systems which contained legacy code. The knowledge that I would get maintaining legacy code would not really be useful in most the other jobs so I would have a hard time getting a new job.

And the **third thing is of course money**. If two companies could guarantee me the first two things then I would usually go to a company that offers more money.

Those three things were equally important to me and you can present them with same sided triangle like this way:

[triangle-image 1](https://marinsborg.com/img/posts/change-job/triangle.jpg)

However, it is not easy to find a company that can offer you all three things. Then you need to be ready to compromise. Usually, if one thing is missing then I would need the other two things to be bigger so you would have a triangle like this:

[triangle-image-2](https://marinsborg.com/img/posts/change-job/irregular-triangle.jpg)

*Of course that I never drew these triangles for myself, this is just to visualize what I want to say.* :)

Now when I gained some experience and I can do my job without any help, I changed things that are important to me. You will probably do the same after some time and that is normal. Life changes the older you are. When you start to work, you are young, inexperienced, you can stay up longer, etc. When you get older, you will have experience, you will probably have kids, you will have more money, you will probably be sick of corporate bullshit and because of all that, your priorities will change. 

Right now things that I am looking for are work-life balance, a great team atmosphere, and money. 

I like my free time and it is important to me not to spend that time on a job. That is why I want to work remotely most of the time. Working remotely will save some that I would lose on a commute and getting ready for a job. 

Working for a few different companies made me realize that having good colleagues is a very important thing. It is easier to work with people that have good technical knowledge or want to learn new things. Also, if you are working in the office then it means that you need to spend eight hours per day with that people. They are almost like your roommates or second family and it is important that you are getting along with most of them. 

Regarding money, it feels good being paid in the same range that other companies are paying their developers for the same or similar position. It might sound weird, but if you are earning less than everybody else with the same skill set you would not feel good at all.

## Reasons to change your job

There are many reasons you can have to change your job but all of them have one thing in common - you are going to improve your life or career or both that way.

I am going to list some reasons and give some thoughts about it

### Poor management, toxic environment, and horrible bosses

I have to say that I experienced all three things in different jobs. I think poor management is something that is very frequent in the IT world and it can frustrate a lot of software engineers. Sometimes the managers would promise something to the clients in some unrealistic deadline. Then people would have to either work overtime or the quality of their work would be bad. When that happens a couple of times then people get frustrated and leave the company.

The toxic environment is related to the office atmosphere. Like I already said - you spend eight hours a day with your colleagues. If they are not good persons or if they are hostile to each other then you know you are going to have a hard time doing your job the best you can. **You shouldn't feel bad or sick coming to the office** or having to talk with your colleagues. 

Also, pay attention to the ""We work hard and play hard"" culture or ""We are one big family"" culture. Companies like that will usually require longer working hours and some scheduled social activities. They will try to use guilt or empathy on you to accept all those ""values"". It is very important to set clear boundaries between your working hours and private time.

### Getting a raise or promotion

The easiest way to get a big raise or promotion is to change a job. A lot of companies pay more to new hires than they pay their current employees. It happens because companies don't raise the salaries of current employees very often and they want to attract new people. To attract new people the company has to offer the salary that fits the current job market. When that happens you should ask for a raise or simply change your job. 

### Outgrowing your position

If you are working the same thing for a couple of years without having any new responsibilities or working on some other projects you might feel bored at your job. If that happens, you might lose motivation to work at all. Talk to your managers about that and see if they can do anything about that. If not, then I would suggest you look for new challenges at some other company.

### Starting your own business

If you want to start your own business I congratulate you. If you researched the market, you know how much money you are going to need when you start and also studied what laws you need to follow then I would say you are ready. It might not be easy at the start but that should not make you feel bad. You should always believe in yourself.

The worst thing that can happen is that your business fails. But it is not that bad because you can always find a job. You still have all the skills you had before.

## You are not married to your company

If you want to change your job but you are hesitant or just want to postpone it for some time in the future because some manager told you that they count on you, please don't do that to yourself.

It is ok that you want to be a good person but there is a time and place for that. Stay professional and try not to include your feelings in that decision. Because the sad reality is that if a company needs to lay off workers to save money, they would do it in a heartbeat. 

Look what happened to Messi. For those that don't know - [Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi) is one of the best soccer players of all time. He played for FC Barcelona for 17 years, won everything he could win multiple times, and broke so many records as a player there. Unfortunately, in the summer of 2021, he needed to leave Barcelona because the club's board spent so much money on other players' salaries so they could not give him a new contract which he wanted to sign. That is why he moved to Paris. You might think it is not a big deal, but he lived in Barcelona since he was 13 years old and he had to leave because of the poor club management.

The point is - leave when you feel you are ready and don't look back. The company will survive without you. **You don't owe anything to the company and the company does not owe you anything** that is not inside a contract you signed. 

## Conclusion

The most important thing would be to decide what is important for you and can company provide all those values that are important to you.

If you notice any red flag or you think something is bad for you at your current working place try to talk with your managers about it and see if that can be improved or fixed. If not, then start looking for a new job and don't look back. Everybody deserves respect and to be paid fairly. Be professional and try not to burn bridges.

The best time to look for a new job is when you already have a job. That way you don't need to accept the first thing you find.

*NOTE: I talked with several people after I published the post and they told me that they like the idea of leaving companies whenever but they would get in trouble with recruiters. I did not consider that because I never had any issues but I understand that countries are looking into this in other way.*"
1222,cscareerquestions,Taboo to ask for more PTO days?," 

Hey Everyone

Just bringing this up for discussion, I just had an interview with a company and I vocalized I wanted more PTO on top of the package they were offering. When asking about this I was told I was being money hungry and that it was not acceptable. Meanwhile they do offer 25 pto days if you're there for over 15 years.

Why is this so taboo? Or is this just a weird interview circumstance.

I declined the offer. Since they insulted me for negotiating."
1223,cscareerquestions,After 5 years of college I think this isn't for me. What do I do with my life?,"I'm 21 and I used to have many goals and ambitions, I always wanted to be a computer scientist since I was a kid. 
I liked to program and it was fun and I still liked it in the first years of college but since my OCD started in 2018 I lost my passion to programming and to most things in life. I just don't see myself working 8h a day in front of a computer anymore.

My passion is guitar, but if I work for 8h a day on the computer I won't be able to play guitar because I have RSI problems. Due to my mental health problems I don't want kids and I plan on living with my parents indefinitely. 

 At this point I'm considering dropping CS and going on a minimum wage job working away from computers or maybe even working part-time for the next 10 years and doing volunteering on the rest of the time. But I don't know if this is a good idea as I wouldn't be able to save any money. What do I?"

1227,cscareerquestions,C#.Net Core interface vs abstract class,"So I got an interview  question about when to use interfaces vs abstract classes, and was told my answer was wrong so I'm hoping you wonderful lot will help me understand. :)

Roughly my answer: well with microservices, interfaces can be deployed  at will and offer a bit more flexibility. So when I want to introduce polymorphic behavior like dependency injection I'd use an Interface. When I want to introduce  widely distributed basic behavior I'd use an abstract class. 

I'm just not sure what part is wrong. Or if I'm just missing something?I don't build abstract classes a ton so I'm guessing I missed something there. Any links or feedback appreciated."
1228,cscareerquestions,I feel like a hot girl on Tinder but with job offers instead of bad pickup lines,"Hi all,

I'm super excited and grateful right now. I'm in my last year of my Bachelor of Computer Science, and in the last month or so I've received *seven* job offers *without looking for one at all*. I do have a Linkedin but I don't have it marked as looking for a job in any way. I legitimately thought it's way too soon for that because I'm not graduating until July or so of next year and I'm quite busy, so I haven't been actively looking for anything.

The big dilemma, however, is that my original plan was pursuing a well known masters program, which is what my parents were suggesting me as well. It's not a bad idea in the long term because your salary and opportunities are better, and the life of a student is great.

But christ, the job offers are too tempting! I was just offered a position in a really cool startup in the bay area (San Francisco). Note that I'm European! They were willing to pay for everything and help me get a visa. And I wouldn't start as an intern; I'd be working full time and with a regular salary (which I imagine would be nuts given the location). Even if I didn't get that one or ended up rejecting it, imagine what I could achieve if I actively looked for something. Living in SF for some time in a startup sounds amazingly fun, in comparison to studying for 1/2 years like a sucker.

The best option would be to perhaps pursue the masters and have a job at the same time, both of them at part-time. But not many businesses want that, and I feel like I wouldn't have much free time in the end.

What do you think? I legitimately have no idea what to do with my life, there's so much going on right now."

1233,cscareerquestions,when is it time to leave (even if i don't have something else lined up)?,"Hey everyone, thank you in advance for the advice here, I don't have too many folks I can turn to for cs career help.

So here's some background. I've been working for this company for about 5 years, we got bought out about a year and a half ago and in that time I've gone from a mid level software engineer to tech lead with absolutely zero help and a lot of demands. The application is not small (300+ models, 3 distinct user groups, and a PHP app running on the side just for funsies), pretty much all built by the original CTO who took his payout and bolted, we had an interim CTO for a minute before he got fired and now it's basically all come down to me and a QA engineer to keep the ship moving. Our VP of engineering is quite possibly the most useless individual I've ever met and has pushed the entire hiring process onto me, including looking for someone with 10+ years experience to essentially work over me. I have anywhere between 3 and 5 people trying to tell me what to do or what needs fixing at any given moment but none of them have anything to offer help wise from suggestions to even running some basic QA.

 NOW, all that said I do get paid decently albeit not really enough for the amount of work I'm putting in. SO my question is at what point do I say enough is enough and bail on this bullshit even without having something else lined up? I've been doing some light job hunting but by the time it gets to challenges and such I'm so burnt out from my current gig that it's tough to find time/motivation for a code challenge.

Tomorrow I have to make a decision: continuing being an IT consultant or have the chance to be a developer.

I don't like my job, as I'm an AMS team so doing pretty much assistance, very little coding activities, and having to be available for costumer for around 70 hours more than the standard 8h/d (paid grossly around 2EUR/h, in case of emergencies I can recover the time I worked, so no additional pay). Monthly I get paid around 1600EUR.

1254,cscareerquestions,"Do I need to put in my two week, or can I just quit?","Hello all, 

Some context, I’ve been working at this start up for 3 months now, and it’s my first job and I’ve hated it since day 1. Some of the senior engineers, including the boss berate the newer engineers when they make a mistake, or when the senior engineers don’t understand something, and have raised their voices to the point of shouting. The work I do here is meaningless, they were so disorganized when I first joined, all the manuals they gave me to learn the software they used were wrong, I ended up finding and editing typos for them. Third and this is a personal small thing, it’s an hour away from my house. It’s overall been a burden on my mental health. Some of the engineers are nice, and I have become friends with them. I recently got a job offer, that pays nearly twice as much as my current job(I’m getting underpaid significantly here) and I plan on taking it, and the new location gave me two weeks until I start. The biggest reason why I am hesitant about putting in my two weeks is because the boss yells at everyone and is basically a man child, if he ever hears something he doesn’t like, or misinterprets something he doesn’t like, he yells, LOUDLY, and I don’t want to put in my two weeks if he’s going to act immaturely.

I get to the interview and totally wasn't expecting EVEN easier questions.

The first one had around 70 employees and was focused on the web presence of their mostly B2C clients. That means we did some impressive FE stuff here. The second one had only 25 people but was more focused on real business web-apps that clients usually used for internal process. That means a ton more of business logic, DDD, architecture stuff and generally a huge focus on engineering and doing stuff right. We mostly worked in teams of 5 to 10 people (including 1 designer and 1 PM) and every team worked on their own project. Projects were usually not shared between teams. 

I kinda got used to work every couple months on a different „green field“ project with different clients from a diverse set of industries (manufacturing, tourism, accounting, …) and solving their specific business needs.

However, I also got used to be really efficient since every hour I work got charged directly to the customer and we had to work within budget. If this couldn’t be achieved, most of the time this meant reducing the scope so that the features we could build were still solid. But still, sometimes you had to implement a not so perfect solution because the customer wasn’t willing to pay more, had to many requirement changes, or needed the release sooner than agreed upon. On the other hand, neither of my employers asked for overtime ever and there was always time for table tennis or a team breakfast or things like that.

Sorry if this post doesn’t belong here, I just need to vent and want advice on my situation.


Background:
I graduated from a no name state school this year. Had a prior internship at a Big N so I had a good job lined up after graduating. Have worked at said Big N for a couple of months now.


What is not the problem:
My coworkers and team are very supportive. The job itself is also fine honestly, just standard junior software dev work.


The Problem:
This is not what I want to do for the rest of my life. I’m okay at it (I managed to graduate and land a good job), but I’m far from at the level of other people in the company and in my team. I think part of the problem is major imposter syndrome, I cannot imagine myself ever being as good as some of the people on my team. I am also not passionate about this work like others are. Performance review wise I have heard nothing but good things, but I cannot shake this feeling. Some of my coworkers and friends eat, sleep, and breathe code, whereas I despise the idea of coding outside of my regular 9-5. I realize that my mindset is somewhat ungrateful, as well, as my current situation is one that a lot of people might envy. But the job is sucking my soul out, and I cannot find the energy to do anything anymore. I barely want to leave my room most of the time, and I dread waking up each monday.

Yeah, I get that the benefits of being permanent factor in (leave, bonuses etc). but the base pay is not great generally speaking ($55k).

I do have financial commitments, I’ve got two young kids. I know it’s not all about the money and that both permanency and the experience of working for such a huge company are important- but given this is meant to be a step up in responsibility from

1284,cscareerquestions,"As a jr. dev, which skills should I be learning?","I got my first programming job. I'm a jr Clojure developer. Back-end. I've been a hobbyist programmer over about a decade too. 

Super weak areas:

* Devops: Kubernetes, AWS, Terraform, Docker. Almost non-existent knowledge of devops.
* Design: UI/UX
* Intermediate to advanced computer science
* Machine learning
* AI
* UML
* Anything with graphics libraries
* Data science
* Non-relational databases
* Graph databases
* Assembly


Weak areas:

*  SQL - Can read it okay, but can't write it well.
* Regex
* Front-end stuff
* Math past algebra and discrete.
* Lispy stuff

Okay:

* Git - Feel pretty good with it but I don't understand rebasing.
* Beginner computer science - Have the knowledge of someone who's taken one or two intro CS classes. Feel comfortable with O(n) and basic datastructures: arrays, hashmaps, linkedlists, stacks, queues.
* Clojure
* REST API
* Testing
* Java, Python
* Debugging


Strengths:

* Linux / CLI


I'm sure there's things that are important that I haven't heard about either. Which of these skills are high in demand and which fit in well with sticking to back-end work? Obviously, I can ignore front-end stuff if I want to stay in back-end, but if becoming a genuine full stack dev would make a lot more money that's stuff I could learn. I'm guessing I should focus on devops and SQL? But not sure how much my CS ignorance is a problem."

* \-Algorithm Design and Analysis
* \-Automata Theory and Computation

I have just joined a FANG about 5 months ago. Currently have about 8 years of direct technical experience but been working for around 11. 

Issue —&gt; stick with FANG role or move back to old company and be a manager. 

Current role:
At my current org I am an IC, no real direction but also came into the org a level lower than what I expected. This particular part of fang typically relays on stock, where the majority of my pay is. 

It also seems like it takes 2-3 years to even get to the next level. Which In my mind is like— I’ll have 11 years of experience as a Senior… (should be staff or hiring). 

Other role:
Company I know we’ll as I worked there for some years. Definitely has its isssues but has gotten better over the last year. I left about 5 months ago. 
Offer would be for a management position making about 100k more TC than I currently make. With about a same match in stock.  
Post IPO and has been so for 4-5 years. 

Wanted to get others thoughts. I haven’t worked at a FANG before and it seems like my future here will be great, but it will take 5-6 years to make what I could make at a management role at a smaller company (about 3-4K people)

Thoughts? Other considerations?"

**Background:** 

I am a new grad and my dream has been to work for Disney in tech. I applied for internships last year and didn't get any interviews, let alone an offer - but I am not ready to give up. Instead, I accepted an offer (full-time) as a Systems Engineer elsewhere. I also plan to obtain a Master's in Systems Engineering (any feedback or opinions on this is welcome too). 

**Questions:** 

1. Do/did any of you work at Disney and can you share your experience (how you did it, what the interview process is/was like, salary, etc)? 
2. Do/did you enjoy working here, what is the tech scene like, company in general? 
3. How do I get in?

1310,cscareerquestions,Do too much planning and that’s all you’ll do: Plan.,"Our brains love planning:
- Huge promise of future rewards
- No obligation to deliver

Instead do this:

1. Start from the end: outline what the plan supposed to deliver, where is it supposed to take you.

2. Set a timer and limit planning to 30 mins max.  

If there’s one thing our brain is also aware of it’s a deadline.  The time limit keeps the focus on what’s important.  

Jot down main ideas, not fully fleshed out details.  

Once the timer runs out STOP PLANNING.

3. Look at the first phase of your project and actually schedule the first set of activities with start and end times in your calendar.  

This makes the plan real and much more likely to actually come to fruition.  

Add a 20% buffer.

4. Once you have scheduled and accomplished the first few actions revisit the plan and repeat the process.

So to recap: by all means plan, but don’t just plan.  Let me know what you think in the comments.

1311,cscareerquestions,How to deal with coworkers who rely on colleagues for their social life?,"I graduated during the pandemic and have been working from home ever since I started in the industry. I love working from home and don't want to be close friends with any of my coworkers. However, many of them don't have a proper social life outside of work and want to do activities outside of work (not paid for) such as dinners and team building exercises. 

I'm blessed enough to have a solid social life independent of my job and don't want to give up on that. Let's be honest: This is tech and I'm likely to leave my position within the next 2 years. When it comes to that, I don't want to be in a position where I leave both my job AND my friends. I think such a situation would put me in a position where I have much less negotiating power.

In all honesty, I couldn't care less about my company's ""mission"" or their ""culture"". I'm in a position where I get lots of experience currently and I like it. But if I won the lottery tomorrow, I certainly wouldn't stay here.

So how do you I (or you in similar situations) deal with coworkers and managers who need you to come back into the office and be social with them, do overtime and go all the way, just because they have no apparent life or ambitions outside of work? I don't want to be an asshole and offend them, but I also need them to understand that at the end of the day, we are only colleagues and I have priorities in life which are much higher, such as my real family, friends, hobbies and so on."

I don’t see myself being a system admin for much of my career, but I could do it for a year and apply for jobs after that instead of rejecting it now and jumping into the abyss of not knowing if I’ll have another offer on the other side.

The second question was about getting the remainder of a large binary number if given something like 32 (2^5). Again, I could barely think, so I couldn't really answer.

The questions about relational vs. non-relational DBs, and event delegation in JavaScript I could at least stumble through but fuck. I have never been so stressed in an interview in my life. It was terribly embarassing.

Am I supposed to be studying for those types of math questions as well?? I'm just trying to make sure I understand how to code, best practices, building projects, etc. I have a degree in Chemistry so I will not be able to do questions that CS graduates may find easy.

So now I'm thinking, time to move on again, already, and interview for months, and I really don't want to, and I don't know how to avoid this situation from occurring again. 

Am I just....not giving these jobs enough time? Should I wait a year and see what develops? Am I a one trick pony who was only ever good at leading one team? Should I just ignore chains of command and go ""sorry, but I'm doing XYZ even though nobody considers that useful but that's what I was hired to do""?"

1354,cscareerquestions,Should I reach out to my recruiter?,"Hi everyone, 
I'm a bit of dilemma or whether to reach out to my interviewer after my interview? 

The interviewer is also someone that I know through LinkedIn and we have met twice. He is very nice and no BS kinda guy. He gave me great advice on when I met him. I've met him once 2 years back and once 15 days ago. 

Back story - I'm interviewing at my dream company(one of it - FAANG, can't tell which one) right now, and I just finished my final round. It was with two different people and two different topics. I feel I bombed one of the interview (with the one I know) and the reason I feel that is cause I didn't think he was 100% convinced. I know I have the right skillset for this job. I know I'm probably gonna ace it. But I just was not able to show that in the interview. He did give some feedback later on which also indicated he might not be 100% convinced. But whatever he gave felt like “why did I not say that? I prepped for it too”

So, I'm thinking to write to him personally over LinkedIn. Do you think it would be a bad idea? 

P.S: Sorry, for the incoherent story. It's 3 am and I'm really not able to sleep."
1355,cscareerquestions,How often do unicorns negotiate new grad?,"I currently have two offers. One is from a previous unicorn company that recently had an IPO and another is from a current unicorn that could potentially IPO before graduation and me joining the company. While base is relatively similar, the public company has a substantially higher amount of equity compensation. Usually, equity comp in the private company could be arguably worth the same due to the likely growth from an IPO but if they IPO before I start work (which is &gt;80% chance imo), I lose all that upside and basically have substantially less equity at that point.

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have any insights on how often these types of companies are typically willing to negotiate? I'm hoping that having two offers from extremely competitive companies will work in my favor here but I'm struggling to determine what's possible in terms of negotiation. I'm leaning towards the second option if the offer comes up but would likely not accept the current offer. Any advice/tips would be greatly appreciated!"

It seems there are a lot more C#+AWS jobs than C#+Azure jobs, which probably has to do with lower cost of deploying apps on AWS. But it also appears that there are as many AWS+Azure jobs as there are pure-Azure jobs.

In your experience **(and without letting my post or the above numbers influence your opinion)**, how does it usually work in **large corporations** using C#? Do they usually go with AWS or Azure? Which one has higher demand in high-paying companies?

1367,cscareerquestions,Horrible experience with a company I was applying for. Made it to final rounds but was drilled into my past.,"Basically, I applied to this small consulting company, they gave a hackerrank followed by a technical portion followed by a soft skill/technical and a final behavioral portion.

For background, I graduated in April this year. I started college way back as a Biochemistry major and switched into CS. My course load was lower but in 2017 I fell into a depression and couldn't get much done. I took the classes again and passed but made up a story for the guy about how my family fell into financial trouble and the stress made me lower my course load while I worked.

Everything was going great and I thought, ""I've developed a lot over the years, I get along with everyone and am hard working, this should be easy."" The gaps can easily be explained with me taking time to focus on my mental health and slowly build up my career.

&amp;#x200B;

I was totally wrong. The first final portion was with the president who didn't even go in depth on my internship experience, they drilled me on all my gaps in college and why I was applying to jobs 5 months out of college. He didn't seem to have any emotion in his face. I told him I was doing leetcode questions and brushing up on my technical skills here and there. He asked where I went to highschool and if I was taking part-time college classes that what I was doing on the other end.

&amp;#x200B;

The final portion after that was absolutely abysmal. This dude has been working for the company straight out of college for 20 years. It started off well with a decent conversation but then he absolutely drilled into why it took me 6 years to finish college. I couldn't say I was fucking depressed so I told him I worked part-time and took a lower load after switching majors and taking on two minors out of personal interest and that my dad was switching careers. He was quiet with my answer until he asked me how I handled a stressful situation like that. He even asked me if my parents paid for college.

&amp;#x200B;

The absolute worst part was when he asked me why I took 5 months from graduation to start applying for jobs. I told him I wanted to relax for a month and started working on leetcode questions to brush up on my skills. If I didn't want to do questions for a day, I would research topics that I didn't know about. This led to about 90 questions completed and a decent understanding of programming. He told me (kind of respectfully) that it felt like gaming the system in a way to do these questions before hand because the questions asked by them are meant to actually test you. I told him that I wasn't trying to memorize them but to just understand different algorithms. He clearly doesn't know that the industry asks some of the hardest questions out there and that most candidates need to study them.

&amp;#x200B;

It's very clear this guy doesn't even know the industry as he's been on this job for 20 years and switched into management. He told me about this finance podcast he listens to and it just reminds me of the toxic hustle culture crap. I think he actually expected me to find a job immediately out of college and work day and night on job applications, while studying. He was keenly interested on all this despite me passing through all their technical questions with ease. I'm sorry that I decided to take a more relaxing path to life while working hard on my skills in a reasonable manner.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe how much I was drilled. I nearly had a meltdown after closing the laptop because: I make friends easy, I work well with teams, and I'm a hard worker. It's clear I have passion and know a lot already and worked towards my goals. I have an internship, personal project, and I do leetcode on the side. Why am I being judged. I'm just waiting on the rejection email, if they'll even send me that. It ended with a decent convo about his experience in the company when I asked about it.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't believe how nice the workers were and how much of a douche this guy was."

1370,cscareerquestions,Our company is prioritizing profitability over doing things right. What advice would you recommend to change this mindset?,"It is evident that my current company is prioritizing delivery on time over designing things better to make changes easier long-term. Hence, technical debt has accumulated so much that it takes months to even add a simple email newsletter to a particular application. Tech debts include 0 unit tests in all repos (50+), almost zero code reviews, writing staging/live creds directly in code, inline css styles everywhere, devs having a hardtime/no idea how to set things up locally (due to lack of docu), all tests are manual, etc. resulting to high attrition rate, taking shortcuts resulting to accumulating more tech debt, and unmotivated engineers.

Now the company has hired Agile coaches to ""turn the company around"" but engineers are skeptical that it will just result to having more focus on what to do (ie. more metrics and more meetings) rather than how to address the current situation.

Based on your experience, what advise would you suggest to make the working culture better as a dev?"

1379,cscareerquestions,Hesitant about Job Offer from pushy (desperate) manager,"I've been interviewing quite a bit recently and have a few final interviews and results coming back to me in the next few weeks.

I've had so many that I feel I have a good grasp on what is a good interview and what is not. I'm used to doing multiple interviews and tasks.

The problem with the subject offer is as follows:

Had one interview that went well. I enjoyed talking to the Lead Dev. It's a small company with a handful of developers. 

During the first interview, I was asked about what the next step should be (wtf?) and if I would be ready to accept an offer. This threw me off as I was expecting there to be atleast another interview or atleast a task or pairing exercise to test my skills.

The job is different from my current one. It's less developer and more DevOps. Though there is quite a bit of development involved it does not involve a tech stack I am familiar with. That is no problem to me as I want to update my skills. 

Things got more weird as I was asked as to whether I would be fine with misc tasks like training the users of the software etc and travelling to them. Isn't that what the sales/implementation team is for (company has plenty of those).

After the first interview I said I want to talk to the rest of the team to get a feel for the work environment. Everything seemed normal. I like the people and how they work. But something is really off putting about how fast this is happening. 

I was asked to give my salary expectations, I submitted this and got accepted right away. A contract will be done up as soon as I accept (mind you I still have to give notice to my current job).

All this happened within a week.

Like I said I am waiting to hear back from others but I am getting pressured to accept this role or lose it. 

Any advice? Thoughts?

TLDR: Pushy Lead Dev makes an offer in a very short space of time, I don't feel thoroughly vetted. Waiting to hear from other recent interviews, feels too good to be true."

Let me preface this by saying I am no way affiliated with Walmart except that I am aware of the service and know of friends currently enrolled and completing degrees.

If you are employed by Walmart in any way. It could be a part time cashier all the way up to a salaried member of management. They offer starting on your first day 100% covered books and tuition to a few accredited school BS programs. 

One of these programs is through Southern New Hampshire University the link to the program is below

I’m a 31 yr old working professional in nonprofit and don’t see any hope for advancing without an additional degree, master’s, or certificate. I graduated in Math, love problem solving (Excel and I are BFFs), and want to make a livable wage at a place that aligns with my values by my 40s. After some research I decided to sign up for an online python based computer science class at a community college to see if that would be a path worth exploring. My main concern is all that extra screen time and how extensive the CS path is in general. At the end of a long day I love making art, reading, walking around town, camping on the weekends, and know this class will make hobbies feel out of reach, but I don’t want that to be the main factor discouraging my decision. There are just so many paths to take- another bachelor’s? A few classes and a master’s? Certificate? Any advice? Since the self-taught life is not for me that rules out all the awesome ways to make it into a CS career on the cheap.

I'd really like to score a solid internship this summer and so I was wondering what projects/areas of CS I should focus on.

For reference, I'm doing a research project with a professor this summer that was focused around web scraping a lot of data from a website and then using some python data analysis to draw conclusions, as well using some machine learning and image recognition and filtering to sort images into collections. I also spend the summer learning DS+Algorithms and solving quite a few DSA problems (\~100) or so, and will continue to practice them until I apply. I am learning web development (I know the basics and have designed some websites, just wanted to learn it at a very good level) as part of a course that starts in a 3 weeks so I will hopefully have some projects to showcase for too!

Is there anything I should focus on specifically in terms of projects or DS to crack the internship? I will continue to focus on DSA since I know these companies put a lot of stress on that. Another thing I'd like to know is whether I have a realistic chance of getting an internship at these places or if I should think about my applications to other places as well."

For the past few months I've been feeling pretty burnt out, I'm basically going through the motions every day with no motivation at all. I'm considering resigning, taking a 2-3 month break (for resting and leveling up a bit) and then getting another job (a remote one, since I live in South America). However, I'm scared to pull the trigger and not be able to find a job later on. I know this is crazy because of the current state of the market, but I don't really have much interviewing experience and I'm afraid that may be a problem. I do consider myself a rather competent developer and I have experience working for really well known companies.

1412,cscareerquestions,Salary bump questions &amp; expectations at a startup,"Hello!

A few months ago I started my first job as a SWE at this startup. I don't live in a high cost of living area like the valley or nyc, but still a major city and the offer (63k) was slightly below average (75k\~ for entry) but higher than a junior position. At this point it had been a few months after my graduation and job searching but more importantly, I really liked the team and the position so I ended up accepting the offer. I can happily say that I'm very happy with my choice and working here has been absolutely amazing in every aspect. Now, I just have a few questions regarding salary and moving forward.

**Quick Info on company:** The company is pretty small (10\~) and the dev team is just 3 people, but they're already doing pretty well in sales and they're making new sales very fast. I'm one of the first engineers and have already built some features but I imagine the team will grow quickly in the coming months. I don't believe they've raised any money yet and have plans of doing so.

1. My biggest question is, what kind of raise could I expect at a startup? They knew their offer (63k) was less than what I asked (which was around the avg), but they also said that it's subject to increase by next year when they get funding. FWIW I was also told I could expect to climb in position/name pretty fast esp since I'm a very early employee and I don't really have any reason to doubt them.
2. I've been on this subreddit for a while and most people say that as a SWE, they change jobs very frequently (like every 2 years) because you can get a much higher increase in salary. Is this strictly true? Can I not have the same type of increases within the same company? I honestly feel like I've found a perfect fit off the bat and I don't see any reason why I'd ever want to leave.
3. This is purely out of curiosity but their plan is to get acquired by a bigger company. If this were to happen, would I get any sort of money? I assume I wouldn't flat out get money since I have no stake in the company, but I imagine it'd come with a nice bonus/increase?

Thanks!"

1419,cscareerquestions,Does anyone else think getting their second job is more difficult than getting their first job?,"I have been working for just over two years, and was fortunate to have done new grad recruitment before the pandemic.  



When I was looking for new grad jobs, I found the standards for getting a job to be much easier: all I needed was either a return offer from my internship or to spend 20 minutes a day doing leetcode and maybe another 20 minutes applying for jobs.  Not all companies were looking for perfect leetcode answers, just good communication skills and the ability to explain the thought process around a problem.





Now that I have 2 years of experience, I'm finding that even pretty unknown companies are asking difficult leetcode medium questions and the standards to get hired are much higher despite my experience.

1425,cscareerquestions,Worried or concerned if I should be doing more as my new Senior Data Scientist job seems a bit too easy.,"Now I've been at this new company 3 months now, and I've actually loving it. The work is interesting, my co-workers are great and so far give me credit even when not necessary. They're all smart, we end up chatting about non-essential work things so we're becoming friends. They all speak highly of our CTO who I directly report too and seems like a great guy as well.

What's the catch?

I'm getting 120k/yr for a job that wanted a Senior Data Scientist with some research  and deployment experience.

So far in 3 months, I feel like I've barely contributed much, and that's mainly due (IMO) to the CTO setting tasks that are too easy for our 2 week sprints.

I can't delve too much into the details, but here are some examples I can give:

1. In 2 weeks, clean up some existing preprocessing code, optimise and add error checking and then dump data into a few databases. Honestly, this took me 2 days. Now admittedly I'm pretty great with Pandas (the best in my last team of 10 DS), but even the most junior guy at my last palce would take a week at this.
2. In another 2 week sprint, I was tasked with testing our inference APIs as they sometimes crash. I created a bunch of scenarios, tested different sizes inputs, batches, missing data, data types etc. Figured out what was causing our frequent crashes (memory issue) and thus figured out a solution (batching and using DASK for some tasks instead of pandas). Again, while 2 weeks is fair because this was a bit of an unknown, it took me 3 days again. Leaving me all of last week to just work on some online courses I signed up for.
3. In another 2 week sprint - (1) Write a short tutorial for new employees on using Poetry (2) write a function to create data pairs for a siamese network one of the other DS wanted to build. Again this all took me 2 days.

I haven't told the CTO these goals are too easy. However, he must know as in our daily standups I basically say I'm finished and that if anyone needs help I'm happy to assist.

I typically help some of the other guys solve a problem or two where they're stuck.

Doing so also made me realize that these guys have fairly simple tasks, but are taking their time in doing them.

Our CTO isn't a data scientist, he's a great Software Eng, but knows the DS field very well at a high level. But, I can't help but think they're either hoodwinking him on how long DS work takes or maybe they're just slow.

I don't think these guys are slow though, I've seen the codebase of most of our products, it's very good stuff.

So now this makes me question the past 2 places I worked straight out of college. 

One was a startup where I was one of a 3 person tech team where we build countless prototypes and lots of small scale production systems.

The other was at a hedgefund as a DS and NLP expert where sprint goals were like 3 to 4 times more work in 2 weeks. I was there for 9 months and quickly got used to the work pace. 

Now, that hedgefund place again wasn't overworking us, but on occasions I'd be working quite late (mainly when things weren't going according to plan due to bugs).

So now I'm wondering if this is how large companies operate.

Our tech team is \~100 ppl managed by 3 main guys + our CTO, our CTO attends the standup for the DS (15) team and backend and software engineer team (27) and has separate standups for the web team (13) and DevOps (7 people). There's another small team out in India (30-40 guys) managing our iOS and Android Apps and older products.

The CTO talks a lot about doubling our tech team to reduce the workload which makes me think either this company is super chill and successful or my own ability and past experience have trained me well.

I'm not complaining, I just want to know if this is reality and not my former experiences?

I have spoken to a few friends about it and most said that they finish their work in 2-3 hours for day and spend the rest just chilling or reading and learning more."

I read this subreddit a lot and I know the hiring market is the hottest it has ever been according to the current sentiment, but I’m still having some doubts about landing a much higher paying data science position. My background is unorthodox for a data scientist so I’m facing an uphill battle in a lot of interviews right off the bat especially if the company has a lot of PhD or master level math graduates (which also tend to pay more).

I’ve been thinking about getting my foot in the door with software engineering and FAANG type companies by switching to backend engineering. I’m very good at leetcode because it’s mostly math related pattern recognition, but I’ve had limited exposure to traditional software engineering.

1452,cscareerquestions,Switching from an EE background to CS,"I did my undergrad in EE and have been working with an ASIC company for over two years. While my job isn't necessarily boring and I don't hate it, there are certain aspects of it that makes me want to shift to a CS career.

Firstly, I am pretty good at coding. I was on par with the CS students when I was in undergrad, and even now in my company I do most of the scripting to automate various tasks. Granted that I work around ASIC engineers and its easy to be a good coder among them, I think I have the potential to do good work in CS.

I like picking up hobbies(side projects) outside of work, just to mess around and have the creative side to come up with something good. Being in hardware makes this incredibly difficult. It is expensive to finance your hardware projects when compared to CS. This is important for me because I start feeling guilty of wasting time if I don't do something outside of work.

Also, currently there are only few ASIC companies and the job opportunities are less. I am wary of the fact that if I start getting bored of current job I cannot find something new. Most of the job openings I can find are similar. The pay for CS is considerably higher when compared to mine. I work for a leading ASIC company and I have seen local startups offering more for someone in CS.

So I am contemplating about taking a MS in CS. I am from India and hope to take it from a good uni. in US. I have a pretty strong profile and can get into good uni. for Electrical and Computer Engineering. My BS GPA is good, have relevant work experience, projects etc. and have a great GRE score(330). But my 'CS profile' is weak. 

So am I better of getting into a Computer engineering degree in a good uni. and taking more software oriented jobs or trying to get into a CS program? Is there someone here working in a software after a MS in ECE? If so, how difficult did you find it? Also, is my understanding that the scope of side projects I can work for in CS is greater correct?"
1453,cscareerquestions,Most of my coworkers have quit. What do I do?,"I'm in a pretty bad situation. In total I have about two years of experience. I've had my current position for less than a year at what I would say is a decent and stable SaaS company. However, the team is small and consist of only five developers. It all started out really good for me, but the past few months things turned around completely. 

Most of my coworkers, the senior ones, have jumped ship for different reasons. The first one left for a different type of job. The second one left for a remote position, and the third one I suspect left because the second guy left.

The ones remaining is me and another guy who's been working there for a little more than a year. Also a guy with zero experience who was hired as a replacement for the first guy who quit. If you count the total years of experience we have lost it's about 85%.

Rebuilding the competence that has been lost is not supposed to be my problem, but I'm concerned that my boss is going to expect more of me going forward and that's not something I want. My guess would be that he's planning to have me be responsible for all of the things the seniors were before and that the things I can't handle will be outsourced. I think he considers the other developer as less capable and having less potential, so that's why it would be me. 

I just don't want to have to deal with constant pressure and increased responsibility. And since we're probably not going to continue working from home in the near future it will be even more stressful. I wouldn't mind the struggle if it meant I would learn and become a better developer, but the reality of the situation is that I no longer have anyone to learn from. The replacements we hire are likely going to be around my skill level or worse because experienced developers are hard to come by in my city.

What should I do to save my situation? I guess I could just talk to my boss and tell him how I feel. He's a pretty down-to-earth guy after all. Finding another job isn't really an option because the only jobs I qualify for, being relatively inexperienced, asocial and uncharismatic, are low tier consulting firms and small agencies."
1454,cscareerquestions,HireRight employment verification issue from tutoring company. Will my offer be rescinded?,"I recently got hired at a company who uses HireRight and during the background check they raised an issue with them verifying my term of employment as an independently contracted tutor so I’m concerned if they will rescind my offer.    

On my experience I listed years for which I was available to be contracted as a tutor, and was available on the tutoring platform. However, over a year of that time I was not actively tutoring students (off their platform at least) so I had no pay stubs to show my employment for that time period.     

This is an entry level position so I’m not sure how much this would impact me but I’m starting to stress as the discrepancy will likely be raised on the report. I was still a tutor on their platform during this time however I could not find any students to tutor through them and was not paid because of that. Do you think my company will care?"

Is it a popularity contest, in how well they get along with people? Is it whether or not they have stepped up and owned a small component."

1457,cscareerquestions,Considering A.S. Degree in software development,"Hi everyone! So I currently hold a BA degree (psychology) from a previous university but I am considering pursuing an AS degree in software development from a local community college. The program seems great, and it seems like I will complete around 10-12 individual coding classes by the time I finish the degree (I am able to complete more than a typical student bc I have basically all the gen eds completed already). Anyway I’m just wondering if it would be at all possible for me to get a software dev internship or possibly an entry level job after completing this AS degree? For context, I live in a medium sized city with an abundance of software jobs. I also would plan to try and finish a full BS degree in computer science or computer info systems at some point, but I’m just wondering if the AS degree alone would make those junior software jobs available for me."

1463,cscareerquestions,Rejected for full time return offer after M Internship. Feeling horrible.," 

Yup, it felt devastating, and worse shocking to hear from my manager that I was not being offered a new grad return offer after my internship this summer. I really thought I was on track and neither my manager nor my mentor had made any hints that I was doing poorly. I asked them both weekly if I was on track and they never had anything negative to say.

I can explain more about what happened and they reasons for gave for not extending me an offer in the comments if anyone is interested.

I'm just not sure what the best way to move forward is. Do I grind leetcode again to shoot for new grad offers or should I delay graduation to try and secure another internship next summer? I graduate December and was really thinking I'd be at Microsoft in January.

Only have 80 LC solved with no DP or backtracking proficiency. Can I grind hard for 2 months and try my best to secure new grad offer in Nov/Dec? And when should I start applying? Thanks"
1464,cscareerquestions,Ashamed of my work experience. What to say when it isn't marketable?,"I've been at my company for many (4+ years) doing dead end work that's specific to my company and not marketable for the jobs I want. This is the only job I've worked and I've been very complacent wasting my life and years here.

Most recruiters are looking for something different in candidates and I have no idea what to write in my resume to appeal to them or what to say when they do the recruiter phone to screen to understand more about my work history. I can't tell them the software engineering buzzwords they want (distributed systems, API, interface, DB, concurrency, JS / react).

My work experience doesn't match what the recruiters are looking for and I'm at mid level to senior years of experience now.

My work experience has basically been like data analyst work maintaining old data pipelines and SQL queries. Even for this type of work, what I do is very low in scope and minimal (i.e. the pipelines and queries are simple).  The pipelines and queries aren't scheduled or formed in a complicated or smart way. There is just a lot of maintenance and product complexity that I deal with. Understanding the data data model enough to write a simple query is the hard part, and the only knowledge I've gained is an intimate understanding of all the different facets and features of my company's specific product.

I don't like my work and want to switch badly but I don't know what to say when asked what I do. I have enough years of experience to be interviewing for senior roles, but I'm just at junior right now with all the useless experience I've had. My feelings of contempt and helplessness have been growing everyday because of my work, as I get further stuck and pigeonholed into this type of work.

I want out to some team that works on or uses typical software engineering work like distributed systems, APIs, web.

Would recruiters take me seriously? What do I say in the recruiter screen interview? How do I market myself?"

1466,cscareerquestions,What is a SWE intern expected to have a strong understanding of when starting out?,"I have an internship coming up soon and I’m curious as to what skills are an absolute must know. I’m worried about showing up and not having a clue how to do my job! 

Skills I have:

I am ok at HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. 

Beginner in JavaScript (don’t know any frameworks). I understand DOM and JSON. 

Intermediate(ish) in Python and Java, although quite new to the less common data structures. Quite confident with OOP, dictionaries, lists, sets, using libraries and built in functions.

I have a decent understanding of the Django framework. 

I’ve written simple unit tests, and selenium webdriver tests. 

MySQL and relational databases

I understand basic networking procedures, like http. GET/POST

I know how to use git from the command line and I have experience with agile project methodology. 

Is this enough to get started with? I know how deep the rabbit hole goes and I know I’m still right at the surface of software engineering, so I’d like to hear from somebody with experience. I feel like I’m not up to par, although I have gotten good grades, I’m not sure university fully prepares you for the job. 

I’ve heard you learn on the job, but what’s the prerequisite knowledge?

Would really appreciate if any experienced engineers could shed some light. 

Cheers"
1467,cscareerquestions,Why don't people learn back end then go into a back end position?,"You see a lot of bootcamps, learning materials, and ways to get either a full stack job or a front end job, however up to this point I haven't seen a ""learn backend in 3 months and make a $120k slary"" plastered on any ads its only ever front end or full stack.

Whenever you Google or YouTube how to learn programming or how to become a software engineer, it is usually once again front end or maybe full stack.

So why is it not advised, or not common to start out learning back end and then going for a job on back end?"

I created software for them that they estimate will save them about 30 hours of work per month for the forseeable future. Personally I'm not that confident in my software's capabilities. But I don't doubt that it'll save them considerable amount of work-hours. I'm considering asking them for something like royalties on the software or payment upfront. 

There is no obligation for them to pay me for my software. I took on this internship because I wanted to travel and getting a paid internship abroad is rather tricky. The reason for me taking on this internship was to have something on my resume for when I apply to graduate school in CS and to get a great letter of recommendation."
1471,cscareerquestions,Strategy for preparation before attempting leetcode,I am in the interview process of a start-up and have a coding challenge coming up in a week. I wanted to practice with leetcode. But I think I need to study up on some basic algorithms and data structures before attempting leetcode problems. I have given my programming language preference as python. From which book can I prepare?
1472,cscareerquestions,"Been working in a small startup for almost 2 years doing pretty much everything on the engineering side, what should I focus on and pursue moving forward?","A little bit of background, I studied Electronics in my undergrad (graduated in 2017, have about 3 years of experience now) and discovered programming and my love/aptitude for it in my last semester. Since then, I have had this chip on my shoulder about not having come from a CS background academically, and whatever I have learned so far has been completely self-taught. I just googled things, read blogs, saw tutorials or tech talks on youtube. I am now confident in my ability to pick up a new library or face new problems and solve it eventually.

Nearly 2 years ago, I joined a tiny startup, and back then, I was hoping to become a Data Scientist and work with Machine/Deep Learning stuff. But I never got the opportunity at my job but was instead tasked with working on building a system around the trained models my colleagues would develop. But eventually, I have realized that the aspect of uncertainty when training a model and struggling to get good accuracy is not for a guy like me who sees things in absolutes. To that end, I have discovered that I actually am good at/ love designing systems and developing individual components. Here is a list of things that I do at my company (keep in mind that I pretty much did 90% of these all by myself),

1. Design the architecture of our product (has an AI core) or any service project (AI core again) I am on
2. Build flask apps that either do CRUD stuff or expose an ML model(s).  I design the API specs and develop them.
3. Design and build data pipelines (both batch and streaming) (Kafka for streaming)
4. I single-handedly developed a module to spin up GPU servers on AWS which shut down after processing things. The design was mostly me under the guidance of my CEO. Sorta serverless approach. I am not familiar with the industry terms.
5. Design how things should be stored on S3. The prefix structure and all
6. Design the database schema and write flask apps with sqlalchemy ORM
7. DevOps stuff like starting servers and setting up the environment. Managing AMIs, Elastic IPs, Security Groups
8. Dockerise stuff when needed
9. I add logs and error report slack bot to everything I do.

My official title is Data Engineer but I think I am working on things that a backend dev and DevOps guy would work on as well. (Please let me know if I am donning a different role or I am wrong about the roles mentioned above)

Now, I absolutely love complex problems and designing and developing large systems that have a lot of services that interact in all kinds of ways. I'd like to think that I am good at it. Because I was doing most of these solo for so long, I haven't had the chance to delve deeper into a subset of these tasks, so I am not familiar with tools like Luigi, Airflow, Kubernetes, Deeper understanding of AWS services, writing python like they do in Open Source libraries, Hadoop, Spark, etc. 

My question to you guys is, what role/title should I pursue and what among the stuff above should I focus less? I want to stay in the AI domain and build large-scale systems around an AI core. I absolutely love designing and developing modular systems."
1473,cscareerquestions,What do companies see from during my HackerRank submissions?,"I find the HackerRank web interface clunky and hard to use, so when I do personal challenges, I code in my IDE and paste the solution into it when I'm done to verify.

1474,cscareerquestions,Going back to school when I already have solid CS career going on?,"So, my situation is quite rare I think. I was doing a CS degree between ages 18 and 21, passed all the required courses, had a pretty decent grades, but then I dropped out right before the finish line because I picked the wrong bachelor thesis and couldn't force myself to finish it at the time.

Right now I am 23 and working in my 3rd job as software developer (previous two were part time jobs during university, right now I am doing full time). I never had trouble getting a SWE job (always got multiple offers I could pick from) and keeping it, as I am passionate about programming and always had side projects etc. going on. 

Given this circumstances, I am confident that I can have pretty solid software engineer career on my own, without getting the degree. However, recently there is a voice in my brain saying I should consider getting back to school, mostly for 3 reasons:

1. There might be a time in the future when I will hit glass ceiling and (CS) degree will be a hard requirement in order to advance my career further. Then it is better to do it now, while I am still relatively young without mortgage and children.

2. I enjoy reading books and articles about programming and self-improve in my spare time and I am interested in some theoretical CS concepts I didn't pay much attention to, while I was studying for the first time.

3. University is great for getting new friends and general networking. I did a poor job in this area during my first run as I was the typical socially awkward, self-conscious kid. I believe I grew a lot as a person during the last 2-3 years and would have much easier time socialising with others this time.

Is there anyone who did something similiar? How did it go? I know it will require dedication and discipline, but I am optimistic as my current job is very flexible and I can do it properly with just 3-4 hours of work (from home) every day. Also, the uni I would go to is decent, but it isn't MIT or anything, so it shouldn't be super stressful.

PS: I am located in Europe, so altough I would have to pay some fees for the second attempt at getting a degree, it is nowhere near what USA universities require and I won't have to take any loans for it or anything. It's like 60% of my one month salary per semester."
1475,cscareerquestions,How to approach a career shift,"Hello everyone, 

I'm currently pursuing a computer science masters degree with focus on AI. During my studies i've been a working student at a local company doing software engineering. My graduation is near and my boss approached me with an (mediocre) offer for a software engineering position. The thing is, i don't plan on staying with the company in the long run as i am more interested in leveraging my degree and going into Computer Vision. 

Now for the difficult part: I don't feel confident in my practical ML skills yet and would want to do the [Self-Driving Car Engineer Nano Degree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd0013) from Udacity first before applying to jobs. Should i accept the offer and do the course on the side or really double down on my decision and do the nano degree full time after graduation? The course is designed to be completed in roughly 5 months.

As i see it: 

Pros for accepting offer: 

* No gap in CV
* No risk involved
* Increasing market value by being employed (?)

Cons for accepting offer:

* Having to move to the jobs location and then again after i leave
* Risk of losing motivation to do anything in addition to a 40hr week
* Wasting time in a field that i plan to leave

Money should not be a factor, i would be fine with being unemployed for this amount of time."

1479,cscareerquestions,Pay attention to what's going on with Blizzard,"Hey guys - if you have the time, take a minute to read a couple of the anecdotes of women who worked at Blizzard, [here](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srp3fb) and [here](https://wtbrecognition.blogspot.com/2021/07/my-experiences-at-blizzard-entertainment.html?m=1).

This sub trends young and trends male, so to that audience, I want to warn you all how easy it is to become acclimated to a culture, even a toxic one.  

When I was 22 I started working for a company that was an acquired startup of almost all men and a handful of women.  It didn't have the problems that Blizzard has - it was far from ""frat boy"" - it was more Office Space-esque cynicism.  It affected me far more than I realized, because as a young professional, I sought approval from my older peers and bosses.  I wanted to *fit in*, so I behaved the way they did.  And it hurt me personally and professionally.  I was completely blind to it at the time, but in hindsight, I was surrounded by bitter, jaded, poisonous people, and I became that way myself.

I know it seems slimy to call the perpretrators at Blizzard victims too, but many of them are, because work does that to you.  When you spend 40 hours a week for years on end with a group of people, their behavior and attitudes (aka, their culture) *will* affect you, no matter how hard you think it won't.

Don't let that happen to you.  If you find yourself at a company that tolerates anything even approaching the way Blizzard let its male employees treat its female employees, do something about it, or quit, or both.  I know the market is tough and that's easier said than done, but even if your conscience doesn't demand it, guilt by association is a real thing.  Blizzard was an amazing name on your resume until about a week ago.  Now it's a liability."
1480,cscareerquestions,How many hours do you all work remote?,"The idea that people actually code productively for 8 hours a day sounds absolutely insane to me, 4 hours is a good day maybe 6 if I'm fresh and hyperfocused.
I work and a startup and do everything from build apps, front end, back end, etc and I just don't see how working 8+ hours makes any sense. Many times I've tried diving in 8hrs or 10hrs only to discover I'm exactly as productive if not less that my usual 2-4hrs. Theres a lot you can do in those hours and by then if the work is completicated can you really still problem solve any more? I worked at a mid size company and it was even more ridiculous since it was much less work(standard crud) and I could easily match my team's output working 1hr per day. I'd welcome that now but in office it's torture fiddling around the other 7hrs.

I've read people say here the program 6-8hrs per day and I want to ask how much of that is ""real"" productivity,  as in it would be impossible for you to accomplish the same task in 50% of the time?"

Not sure how to summarize my work—I basically do whatever needs done to push a DS software project forward. Devops, ml pipelines, straight analysis, front end dev. I’ve been here a little over a year and have enjoyed the work and my coworkers, though I’ve felt a little crazy at times and vastly underpaid. 

I’ve started looking at new jobs. My main criteria has been finding something software engineering heavy (but still DS adjacent), as I don’t have a CS degree and feel like swe skills are what a junior DS should be building (plus, as someone without a cs degree, having SWE on the resume would be a great stamp of approval).

I’m being offered a swe job at an exciting analytics focused startup with a big raise, but the catch is it is fully froentend focused. I enjoy front end work and would love to spend a couple years honing my craft, but am wondering if any folks have experience transitioning out of front end and into backend or DS work, as I know when I am an old man ds work will likely be more satisfying and I’ll want to get back into it even if id enjoy doing front end work now."

Or pretend and say something like, “This looks like an interesting question, could you give me a minute to think through it?” or something like that.

I don’t mean to literally say those things, but should you pretend to struggle a little and hide the fact you literally solved it 2 hours ago, or should you sound like you know what you’re doing from the start, which might lead them to suspect you just practiced this specific problem?

Anyway, before I enrolled in the university, I had 0 experience with either programming or hardware, so I thought it was a good idea to enroll in a course that deals with both of them. But after 3 semesters, I realized that I am disliking the hardware classes (Digital Circuits, Computer Architecture and Organization and Microcontrollers), but on the other hand I am loving the programming and math classes. So I started to think on changing courses to Computer Science, which deals more with software/programming than hardware. But I have a few questions that I hope someone could help me:

1) Am I being too hasty? I am on my 3 semester, which makes 3/10 of my entire course, but I feel that I will only grow to dislike more the hardware classes. I am learning Assembly by the way.

2) I plan on getting my degree and leave Brazil, maybe for Canada or another country, didn't think too much yet. So, is there a difference between both degrees? Should I take one over another? 

3) A engineer computer has more chances on ascending the hierarchy of a company than a scientist computer? My father tells me that I should continue my course on engineer because companies tends to prefer engineer for position of leaders, but I don't know if that is correct.

4) Should I just finish my course, and after specialize in the area I want? I am leaning web right now, but the university is taking most of my time, so I can't focus too much. I know that if I change the course, I won't have more free time, but as I would be programming more, I think it would help me.

Can someone help me? I am really really lost"
1500,cscareerquestions,"How many years (er, months) of experience do I have, and what jobs should I apply for?",[removed]
1501,cscareerquestions,How do I learn to move on?,"So, a little backstory. I joined a small company of like 15 people nearly a decade ago. Today it's almost 150 people and I'm in a senior leadership role. I've really loved my work and team here. I'm a manager and have spent \~5 years building several teams. I have never had a single person leave one of my teams, ever, because I've put so much effort into creating a great environment and making sure everyone is competitively paid, etc.

One major sticking point for me, though, was that I never had equity in the company. My contributions have been really outsized and I always felt this was unreasonable. Early 2021 I finally managed to negotiate what seemed like a substantial equity stake, but long story short it ended up being mostly a scam. They lied to me about a lot of details, about the timeline, and basically gave me this big stake that was only partially vested and then they went on to immediately start selling the company. When I raised concerns about this and said I felt like the shares should auto-vest on sale, they got extremely rude and aggressive with me and treated me like I was crazy. It made me realize the people I'd respected and looked up to so much over the years were very different people when money is involved, and they were confident enough the sale was going to go through that they were okay burning bridges with their most valuable employees.

Even though my vested stake is theoretically worth a decent amount of money, I was so insulted I went and got an engineering management offer at a top tech company within a month of that conversation happening. My passion for management must have come off in the interview since it got approved so fast. I've already accepted it and am coming to terms with the fact that I have to move on. 

The company is being sold to a large corporation of 70k+ people and my own management has treated me like a crazy person and basically tried to scam me in the lead-up to the sale. And yet I am seriously struggling to move on. I haven't turned in my notice yet and am dreading explaining to my teams that I'm leaving, especially since I can't explain any of the reasoning to them. And it kills me to know that they are all likely going to go through a nightmare acquisition process in just a month or two, and they won't have anything whatsoever to show for it. They have no idea the company is about to be acquired, and I'd be fired for sure if I told anyone as it's considered extremely confidential.

I don't really know what I'm looking for here -- I guess just advice, thoughts, or stories from folks who've been through something similar."
1502,cscareerquestions,Is the job offer I've received competitive?,"Im a rising senior in college. I've had 3 internships with 4 years of industry experience in computer science. The job I've been offered is in the Chicago suburbs, and the total salary is 68,000 dollars. Is this a competitive offer? I dont have very long to accept it, so not enough time to get offers from other jobs before the deadline. I've heard of some college grads making 100k as developers, but I dont know if it's true or not. What do you guys think? Is this a good offer or no?"
1503,cscareerquestions,[Advice needed] Countering an offer with another companies offer letter?,"I have two companies that offered me a job. Company A I really want to work for, company B I only sorta want to work for.

Company A's offer is not as good, by 30-40k salary and 10x equity (5 figures vs 6). Can I show Company A the offer letter from Company B in the hopes they'll match? The offer is so much less that I'm worried it's insulting.

Conflating the issue is that Company A is run by people I've worked for/with in the past and I don't want to accidentally sour our relationship."
1504,cscareerquestions,Salary expectations for quant team lead?,"I am in the interview stages for a job at a small tech company (100-250 people). The head office is in SF and they have a handful of satellite offices all over North America.

I am interviewing to be the lead (2-5 people once fully built out) of a quant / machine learning team. It is not directly a programming job per se. It is cross-posted in my local office and SF and they are interviewing candidates in both.

They are asking for salary / comp expectations. I come from a finance background so I have little insight into how these things are typically structured and I don't want to throw out a crazy number. 

Thoughts on what my prior should be here?"
1505,cscareerquestions,Has anyone reneged the day before you start date?,I'm about to start a new job on Monday but got offered a different job with 40% more salary. I can use some reassurance that reneging is the right call.
1506,cscareerquestions,Internships paying $70/hr. How is this possible?,"I was looking around on levels.fi and found a bunch of internships paying ~70/hr with excellent benefits. I was planning on applying for internships, and just expected that they would be lowly paid or unpaid. To be honest, I'm shocked.

So, now I'm wondering:

1) Are internships like this legit/ common?
2) How competitive are they/ what's the catch?
3) How can I get one of them?

Thanks in advance for the info!"
1507,cscareerquestions,Concerns about job offer," Just starting out as a Software Programmer, so I will join almost any company I can get, however this offer raised some flags: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJ1OFVi7dk2l3toOsB5jyWy0kWnAvZhF/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJ1OFVi7dk2l3toOsB5jyWy0kWnAvZhF/view?usp=sharing) .

First off, the pay is awful ($1,500/month for 3 months, $2,000/month for next 3 months, no PTO...).

Second, the offer doesn't even have my name on it, which just might have been a mistake on their part but still very fishy.

and Third, I am worried that if I sign I won't be able to join another company 1 year after quitting this position due to the non-compete agreement at the bottom of the page. Are MSPs a common company in the US? Should I be concerned?"
1508,cscareerquestions,CS or IT,"Hey guys I'm currently applying on college and I'm confused between CS and IT, i have ambition on both of them I don't know which one is have a good future jobs at least to 2030, and more ability to make Cyber Security easier for me, I'm planing to take courses and professional certificates about cyber security after the bachelor, and maybe the master degree,  i don't know help."
1509,cscareerquestions,The only thing that annoys me about leetcode,"Is when people say that it's a test of your ""fundamentals"" when it's more about pattern recognition.  


Why does this matter? Because it has implications for how you should prepare.  


For example,  
\* Understanding an optimal solution is more important than deriving an optimal solution yourself. The former also tends to be quicker and less painful than the latter. As the legendary samurai  Miyamoto Musashi said, ""You can only fight the way you practice."" If you practice by giving yourself a whole day to solve a medium level question then don't be surprised when you run out of time in the real interview.   
\* The best prep you can do is to know what type of patterns the company you're applying to likes to ask.   
\* Luck is a huge factor so the maximum amount of time to spend studying should be equal to the maximum cooldown time before you can reapply.  


All interview prep material is nothing more than an arbitrarily selected series of patterns. It may be a useful starting point but there's no reason why for example, a stack question from CTCI or EPI will be any better than a randomly selected stack question from leetcode. If anything, as more people become familiar with the patterns in those books, the less likely the are to appear in a real interview."
1510,cscareerquestions,Delta Full Stack Java Newhire,"Hello everybody! My background check and drug test came back today and I am cleared to start my first day with Delta Airlines within the month! 

I’ve worked for smaller companies in the past, as a jr dev, but am extremely nervous because Delta (a huge company) has decided to bring me on as a mid-level dev! 

I would love some insight of what my daily activities may look like, if anybody has any. This last role I spent a lot of time basically onboarding/training backend interns while also assisting the frontend angular team with setting up routes/authorizations.

Any insight would be much appreciated!"
1511,cscareerquestions,How to network with a company not in your region,Say I want to look for other opportunities in companies out of state. How would I get connections to understand what they're doing or for a referral in those cases? Have former coworkers that move into those companies? What are other ways you can network with places far away?
1512,cscareerquestions,Pivoting into the tech industry?,"Hey guys, I wanted some advice on how to pivot to the tech industry from a business major. I recently graduated with a bachelors in finance and accounting. And a masters in accounting with a certificate in data analytics. Working to get my CPA right now. I’m going to be working in management consulting probably for 2 years or so depending on how I like it. Out of curiosity, anyone have any advice on how to pivot to the tech industry after gaining some work experience? 

I don’t think I would want to be in the accounting department at a tech firm but rather the finance side probably. But as I look at requirements for roles at big tech companies, many obviously have programming requirements. SQL, etc.

after gaining experience working, would it be wise to learn some coding, etc or what else could help pivot into the industry? I just want some tips in case I could be working on extra skills on the side while I’m working in consulting. Thanks!"
1513,cscareerquestions,Should I tell a prospective company that I have an offer from another company?,"I have received an offer from Company A. I also just finished the final rounds of interviews for Company B, who is my preferred company to work for. 

I am one of the final 3 for Company B and they said they expect to have answers on Tuesday or Wednesday. But Company A also wants me to give them an answer by Monday whether I accept their offer or not. 

Should I tell Company B about my job offer from Company A and that they want an answer before Company B expects to give me an answer?"
1514,cscareerquestions,International student career path advice,So I was unable to get an internship during my three years of undergrad (in CS) but I did get an AWS cert and have some personal projects posted on Github. I will be graduating in May 2022 and I'm not sure if I'll be able to find a job for my OPT given that I don't have any prior experience. Would it be advisable to keep at the Job search or Pursue a Masters in CS and get an internship and further build my profile and continue job search post-grad school.
1515,cscareerquestions,Nee advice for my bachelor's degree,"I am having to choose a college this year and for the degree, going with CS due to my parents. I want to pursue as a graphic designer and I am pretty good at drawing too. I want to know if there are some  other formalities to be a graphic designer.

Both are offered at the same college, both are 3 year programs and have paid internships. My interest lies in cyber security (I know that’s a very broad term, many specialties exist within it) so originally I wanted to study the ITNetworking/Sec program. But recently I was doing research and it seems that software development, CompSci etc will lay a better foundation for cyber security than the IT program. That’s what many people also suggest, the CS programs. I’m not 100 percent convinced, I’m on the fence. Please tell me what you all think and explain in detail"
1518,cscareerquestions,Thoughts on “we’ll fix it in the next PR”?,"Hey all, been at my first job for about 7 months now, fresh out of school before that. One thing that I’ve seen happen a lot during our reviews of PR’s is someone may point out a minor fix (maybe a variable typo, etc) and the person who submitted the code will just say “oh I’ll fix it in the next PR” and ask for approvals. How normal is this, and if it’s normal, how minor should the fix be for it to qualify?"

1520,cscareerquestions,"I did it, I made the final push to finally get back on track onto becoming a developer","Long rant about my revelation.. Feel free to ignore but I'm going to be with this sub for the long run. 

I know it's a hot debate BUT I plan on enrolling into Fullstack Academy. I posted earlier about my game plan but I seriously look forward to learning everything. 

Previously, I was a part time field technician and also spent many years providing technical support to a medical team as a secondary role. Today, I dusted a server and finally came to terms with my decision to drop everything I was doing to get into networking and to pursue my long delayed dream of becoming a developer. 

That said, I realized I do NOT want to have a home lab (virtual or not) to test my skills, I don't actually find passion working with server racks or end goal of becoming a network architect, and I'm not interested in any of the topics I was exposed to when I got my Security+  (apart from virtualization, general security, encryption algorithms). What really peaks my interest is the idea of creating through programing, turning ones idea into reality, and of course being part of the development side of this ever growing ocean of people with ideas/issues that need an application/software to help bring it to fruition/resolution. 

What stopped me during my InfoSys time in college was my own thoughts such as thinking I needed to be the guy who has been coding since he was 11 to be successful. Does he stand a higher chance? Sure. Does it mean it's impossible for me? No. I refuse to think that way and I also understand I'll always be learning. I'll never know everything so as long as I continue to want to learn, I feel as if I'd do well here. 

**That said, and in respect to the purpose of this sub, I'll need to finish with a question. So I just ask, what are some of your advice for beginner programmers especially advice that you wish you had been given at the start of your career? **"
1521,cscareerquestions,What are some good resources to prepare for Architecture / Service Design Interviews?,[removed]
1522,cscareerquestions,Advice for fresh grads transitioning to a full-time role,"Any advice for fresh grads in their first full-time job? Some questions I have been thinking about are -

1) How fast should I be assimilated in my role and be fully performing?

2) Is there a need to have a professional and personal self? Should I bring my liveliness in my interactions with my colleagues - will smiling in conversations give off a bad impression?

3) The firm is known to have a self-service culture (which I am used to), however, how often should I ping someone for help without coming across as annoying? A mental model that I am living by is to problem solve first, and only reach out if I can’t find any resources anywhere - but there are a multitude of tools which I will only learn when I have a use case for it. Plus, I see it that the first time asked is a lesson, and the second time is a mistake. 

4) How honest should you be in your 1:1s with your manager? During my internship, I mainly used it to keep my manager updated on my weekly tasks plus to seek mentorship - which had been useful; however, now as a full-timer should the structure be changed?

5) Do you see your colleagues as your friends? Or are most bonds kept professional?

6) Any other advice will be great too

To provide some background, I just graduated and managed to get a role in another team in the same tech organisation that I was an intern at - which I am extremely grateful for. 

While the culture is similar, the role is very different - but it is something that I’m enjoying so far. And I have been working for 1 month - was at my internship role for 6 months. 

However, the feeling of imposter syndrome has been weighing really heavily on me, and I feel the need to be able to deliver - especially as my internship manager had put in a good word for me with the team I am at.

And I have been using weekends to complete work. For example, using Sunday’s to prepare for meetings on Monday. Plus working till almost 9pm every night, as I’m using my time to go through training materials and unfamiliar documents. But I don’t know if it sustainable for the long-run. And I know it’s about working smart, not hard - but I feel that there is a need to come across as competent."
1523,cscareerquestions,Question | Company’s OA questions were exactly the same as LC questions,"Hello everyone! I am a student at a CS uni, and recently I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to be interviewed for a software engineering intern position at one of the FAANG companies - my first time, can’t tell you how happy I am!

As almost everyone here, I studied hard for the first round OA - CTCI, Leetcode, Abdul Bari’s algorithms videos, all that jazz.

I clicked “Start the test”, and to my surprise, I got the EXACT SAME questions that I just studied for earlier during the day on LC.

I usually like to study on LC by trying to solve the problem by myself first, then look at the explanation video on YT, edit the code, and to get even better performance, I look at the discussion page to see how I can improve my code more.

Anyways, the thing that I am mostly worried about is that since the solutions to the problems were still fresh in my mind, I am afraid that I might’ve written code that might be similar to the other people’s solutions.

I am absolutely sure that I didn’t write the exact same code like them, but I really don’t want to be picked off by the service’s automatic anti-plagiarism system, which would discredit me forever.

It’s been three days since I wrote the OA, and the phone screen is coming up soon. Should I still be nervous about my OA? If the recruiter asks me about it, is it valid to say that I studied from LC? If there was an issue with my OA, they would reach out to me already, right?

I am sorry for these stupid questions, it’s my first time having a *real* interview in this field, and I’m nervous about it."
1524,cscareerquestions,A take home assignment,So I got this take home assignment last night about building a data table in react with some custom filters. The hiring manager said there is time limit and after struggling a bit I am sure I can't get it to him before Monday is that fine? I mean will it hurt the chances of me getting to the next step?
1525,cscareerquestions,How feasible is it for an American to find a job in a foreign office of a US tech company?,"I am wondering if I were to apply for a foreign office of a US tech company (such as Big N and similar companies) how likely is it that I would be seriously considered for the role as opposed to the same process in a US office?

I have a few years of dev experience under my belt and found that my qualifications roughly match up with a couple such job postings I found online. However I'm wondering if these companies would strongly prefer local engineers for roles in these offices over Americans.

My goal is to spend a couple years working in a specific country where I have some family and can spend some time with them, but then eventually to return to the US after that. While I would be open to transferring to a US office at the same company, my point is I would only be planning to work in a foreign office temporarily.

I would not be looking to seek citizenship in the host country or anything like that. I'm kind of worried a company will understand this and feel hesitant to hire me for that location; they may see me as a flight risk after a couple years and prefer to hire a local who would potentially stay employed there for a longer duration. Or, they might not want to go through the interview process with me since it's more likely someone in my position would get cold feet about accepting an offer halfway across the world, compared to a local.

Have any Americans here successfully found jobs abroad? Or alternately, if you're a non-American engineer, are you familiar with any Americans or expats that found jobs this way?  Realistically, is it doable?"
1526,cscareerquestions,Unusual Difficulty of Question? Maybe not...,I was interviewing for a company and an intern(robotic startup in dallas) and wanted to work with data and computer vision. It was supposed to be a college position but I convinced them to let me try and they gave me a leetcode hard question. I checked on leetcode and other sources and found out they give college students mostly easy questions and at best medium(maybe not but that's what i've heard) and am thinking did they asked me that just because I was in high school or something. I didn't get a response back yet and solved like 70% of the way(i'll link the problem below in the comments). Is this unusual or is leetcode hard expected for interviews(internships at least)?

1531,cscareerquestions,Interesting opportunity from my college,"Hi everyone, 

When I went to my college there is an opportunity for me to basically study abroad and earn a dual degree alongside my main degree, and internships available at a selected university. The selected University, which is located in Germany,  offers bachelor degree in automotive CS, BSCS, BSEE, and many others as well as master degrees in MBA, CS, etc. It’s also an Applied Science university which I’m sure is not the same as an A.S. Degree(?). 

Plus the internships there are going to be near major automotive, industrials, or startup mostly in Germany. 

Should I take this opportunity ? It seem like a decent experience culturally, as Germany seem like a nice place to go, but I don’t see how it can help with my career goal of working into a government job - foreign language experience is a plus, but not sure about everything else."
1532,cscareerquestions,Should I plan to leave my new job?,"TL:DR - Joined a new company and have been micromanaged a lot and I'm not sure what to do next.

I don't know what to do at this point. I started working in my new job two months ago and when I joined they put me into a department and a role that was different from the job description. Nevertheless, I welcomed the opportunity to do it and I initially enjoyed it...until I didn't. Within a few weeks into the role I started to get a sense that I wasn't welcomed there and I was right. In the form of passive aggressive questions they felt that I wouldn't be able to get caught up to speed quick enough to be productive. I disagreed with their assumption and kept plowing through the best that I could, it wasn't difficult for me to learn about the ins and outs of data and the insurance industry. Personally I liked it and learned as much as I could but, my manager sided with the naysayers and he placed me into a different role within the team.

Part 2:

When I started my new-new job in a different role but with the same department things started off well...until things started to get strange. One of my coworkers who isn't my manager has been micromanaging everything that I do recently. We just had a meeting a few minutes before I wrote this post saying things to me like ""I'm not producing"" due to her request to me that she had failed to clarify in detail. I defended myself because it would've been like cooking a recipe without knowing the ingredients. Then she started to pester me with questions like ""What did you do in your prior companies?"" as a way to size me up more. Her request was something that I didn't know was my responsibility in that moment but I wouldn't have had an issue with doing it if I had more time and more context on what was required. After our 1-on-1 I gave her some advice on what she could do better to communicate her request but I still have a knot in my stomach. I like my job but I had no idea the team would be this toxic."
1533,cscareerquestions,Not sure what to do,"So I might end up having to choose between two options very soon: staying at my current workplace and getting a promotion, or moving on to a new company doing close to what I currently am today.

The promotion would be raising me at a senior level from a junior level. It's a great pay bump and I would start to have a few juniors under me. This is great as I don't have THAT terribly much experience (between 3-4 years total). The only thing is, I work for a smaller government entity, so the pay compared to the corporate world is much lower.

The other company is looking at me for a junior role. It would be very similar to my current position, just a bit more stress due to corporate workforce vs government pacing. The only thing is that the junior role could pay about 15k more than the senior role where I currently am.

I love where I work. I love my boss. It's a great setup as I work from home 3 days of the week. I would have that senior title early on and learn to manage a team. However, I'm afraid I'd be stuck there making far less than I would if I go with the new company.

Any suggestions on how to navigate this?"

1535,cscareerquestions,Opportunities dilemma,"Hi tech-savvies,

I work in a nationally big company as a consultant for a temp agency. My benefits package is pretty thin and my salary was relatively low (compared to developers). I recently negotiated it - showed how I concretely improved myself and my request has been approved by my employer - same benefits package. In the meantime, I'm solicited by other recruiters - not trying to highlight my profile; I literally don't have much confidence in my abilities. One of those companies is a SME - a startup-like company, not a consulting company. Benefits package is much better; salary is slightly better than my current one and the big difference is that my role is focused on the development side (based on the contract) while currently my scope is not clear as I'm doing pretty much everything available in our agile environment from microservices dev to ops to testing to prod maintenance... and most importantly I used to change contracts (including the employer) every year or so and I feel exhausted a bit about changes. I have around 5 years of experience and I want to gain some expertise. Would it be better to wait almost another year and join the client of my current employer and from there, my scope will be well defined - I think, and I would get better inclusion in some aspects of decisions, or to accept the offer, see what this company can offer especially in terms of career growth?"
1536,cscareerquestions,Dropping out of medical school. Could use some career advice.,"As the title says, I'm dropping out of a US medical school after my first year and could really use some career advice. You can probably guess from my username that I was having mental health problems throughout school, but I also just decided it wasn't for me.

Now I'm in the process of deciding what I want to do next and I'm honestly feeling really lost. My dean recommended that I look into jobs in health informatics, which I had never even heard of. Over my first year I got to use a couple different electronic health records and I definitely thought they were interesting. My only CS related experiences are just things basic things like playing around casually with Python before medical school. 

I still definitely have an interest in healthcare and would like to find a way to incorporate it into my career. I had never really considered the possibility of doing something CS related until my dean mentioned it and now I want to explore the field further. So I guess I'm wondering if you guys have any advice on what I should do next? All I can think to do is take community college CS classes and see if they interest me or possibly try to learn some coding on my own. I'm not sure if internships are viable, as I don't have any prior experience. Maybe I'm wrong about that, though. I would also be curious to hear if there are other potential career paths that I haven't considered that may be able to merge my interests?

Sorry if these questions are too basic, but I thought you guys might be able to help me."

Hey guys. I'm feeling depressed after a couple of rejections from internships where their qualifications essentially just ask for an average joe cs student. The most recent rejection is from Freddie Mac and these are their requirements:

* Seeking undergraduate degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or related area
* Cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater
* Rising seniors preferred; rising juniors considered
* College-level experience with coding practices and languages (such as Java, C/C++, Python, or others)
* Knowledge of Agile software development project methodologies preferred
* Experience with popular business tools (Windows, Office Professional, Visio, SharePoint, etc.)
* Demonstrated analytical ability and problem-solving skills
* Excellent verbal and written communication
* Organized with ability to meet deadlines and contribute to team success

Their email said that ""We have carefully evaluated your resume against the qualifications of  the position and will not be moving forward with your application"". Fast Enterprises LLC and Federated Insurance also basically said I'm garbage as well. I know that I have to submit a huge amount of applications, but I feel like I'm too garbage for anything whatsoever. 

I'm trying to leetcode and learn more development stuff (android codelabs and some pwa stuff on udemy), but I feel like I won't learn enough in time and that I'll not be able to get anything."
1538,cscareerquestions,Money or experience?,"I have two job offers that are very different from each other.

Job 1: This is the experience job. In this position I’ll be doing a lot of programming/data analysis using multiple platform and languages. I would be gaining a tremendous amount of experience, but at a lower salary than job 2. Job one pays 16k less a year, job two would also require me to drive to offer 25 mins away. This position is much more advanced than my current position, and would help me propel into a data scientist position some time in the future.


Job 2: This position is a remote position, but would require me to be stationary and work from my home. This position pays 16k higher, but is much easier work. My title would be more of a system admin than actual developer etc. This position is also hourly, with the option of OT. I’m nervous though that if this position didn’t work out that I could be stuck and not be able to get another developer position. 


What would you do?"
1539,cscareerquestions,Would it be a bad idea to quit my job?,"For context, I’ve been contract worker for two years and my funding ends at the end of September. I’m am unbelievably unmotivated, partially from WFH burnout but also because the work is no longer challenging and they do not seem interested in helping me develop my skills (even after I asked at the beginning of the year). I feel I have been a valuable member of this team and have always carried my weight plus more.

I have a pending interview with what I would call a “dream job” position. I asked for time to prepare for the interviews and they are working with me. I have found it challenging to learn the CS fundamentals and prepare for interviews while doing this current job. It’s tedious and boring and honestly I’m a little bitter that they don’t seem to value me. I just want to cut ties and get a fresh start.

How bad would it look if I just put in my two weeks and took a month or three to prepare for a new career? I’m currently more science than software but I’m hoping to make the leap to full software engineer. Financially I can afford to do this but obviously it’s not ideal and could be risky if I do not find a job within 6 months or so."

1544,cscareerquestions,Help Finding that First Job Out of College.,"So, quick background information. I just graduated in May with Bachelors of computer engineering and have been looking for a job since November to no avail. I get a couple of interviews or so a month, but something always happens that I either can't take the job, or they end up dropping me during the interview process. For example, just got told to go pound sand by a Kansas Bureau of Investigation since I didn't have enough experience, even though they only stated that they need someone with at least 24 hrs of college credit in CS in the job posting. Since I also have an associates in Criminal Justice and police experience from the Marine Corps, figured I would be a shoe-in since I know the culture. Nope....

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, most of the job posting I am finding are from ZipRecruiter and Indeed. Some google searches also help me find job postings as well, but I feel the majority I see on google are scams. Are there any other good sites that have a decent amount of job postings for new grads or junior level? Is there better avenues of approach when finding that first job, or am I stuck grinding out 5 to 10+ detailed applications only to have 98% of them not even be looked at.

I was wondering if there are some edge cases where I don't know the solution (but I've identified this is an edge case) would it look bad since I don't know a solution OR will the interviewer look at the positive side that I recognized the edge case?

I explained to them my research publication that focuses on machine learning for inspecting the packets. 

After a technical discussion on security and how it can be improved by utilizing machine learning, the interviewers proceeded with the statement: ""*Look, our country is extremely backward in the field of security. You sound well-versed even with standards like ISO27001, SOC2, PCI-DSS, but we have not implemented even a single clause of any compliance.""* The position was related to a managerial role in information security. 

I tried to put forth that if the country is lagging extremely behind in this domain, we could initiate the journey towards advancement. We discussed the strategies that could be employed for this process. In the end, they refused politely and mentioned that they are looking for someone who is more well-versed with existing systems which they claimed themselves to be outdated.

1562,cscareerquestions,First Internship Offer for Fall 2021,"Hello! I'm a college student going into my junior year. I recently applied for an internship and was really excited that they would consider me. The thing is as the interview process went through I didn't feel the excitement as before. it is a sole proprietorship company and the things they sell are nice.

During the interview, they asked me where I was from and later asked where my parents are from. I didn't realize until after the interview and it made me feel iffy. My school expects a maximum of 15 hours for an unpaid internship but they expect 20-30 hours. When I do ask questions regarding the internship, they would ask me if they can call me. This happened when I asked about the hours. The company told me if I can tell my school to work 15 hrs but do the hours the company requires. I'm going to be taking 5 classes. I can also do the work in my own free time so I don't know what to think of it.

There are no zoom meetings because of college students busy schedules and I heard from interns that the tasks are repetitive, but the person is sweet. I never had an internship before and would like to have one in the fall. They expect me to reply asap to their offer. Should I keep looking and apply for more internships or accept this one as a first experience?

Throwaway just in case.

&amp;#x200B;

\###### Stats:  

&amp;#x200B;

\- Graduated May 2021 from a non-CS state school

\- GPA: 3.8

\- No internships

\- Average to slightly below average at Leetcode

\- Anxious and bad at interviewing in general

\- 311 total applications in about 2.5 months, 2 onsites, 1 offer

&amp;#x200B;

\### Application Process  

I waited until after I graduated to start searching for a job mostly because I didn't feel ready for interviews before then, which was a mistake because 1) new grad hiring is at like right at the beginning of senior year apparently and 2) I needed the practical interviewing experience even if I wasn't ready. APPLY EARLY. 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I started applying, I went for everything that listed less than 4 years of required experience, mostly finding things on Indeed, LinkedIn, and AngelList. I did not apply to any FAANGs. I looked all over the country, but mainly focused on New York, Seattle, Chicago, and Minneapolis. I tried to apply to at least 5 a day, sometimes getting up to 15 in one day or going days without applying. I did not tailor my resume or write cover letters, but I did only apply to jobs whose tech stack I had at least a little experience in and could conceivably be qualified for.    

&amp;#x200B;

\### Interviews

I absolutely suck at interviewing, my mind just goes completely blank and my social anxiety is awful. I struggled with behaviorals at the beginning and failed a few phone screens, but quickly got a little better with practice (at least good enough to make it further in the process). I still struggle with Leetcode, even after studying for the past few months and buying Grokking the Coding Interview. I can do maybe 70% of Easy and a few easier Medium problems. Thankfully, I only ran into Leetcode in OAs; all of my technical interviews were very basic with no Leetcode.  

  

I bombed the onsite for a new grad program at a large company even though it was very easy which was devastating. I was convinced that was my only shot, so I temporarily gave up interviewing and took a mental health break. I ended up getting the call to schedule the interview that landed me the offer only a few days after that, luckily!

  

The interview process gave me some of the worst anxiety and depression I've ever had and I am extremely glad I only had to do it for about 2 months. Solidarity with those of you still looking after 6+ months... I have extreme social anxiety, so every aspect of interviewing is a nightmare to me. Every phone interview or onsite I had, I was on some combination of propranolol, a stiff drink, and meditation / breathing exercises 10-15 minutes before.

&amp;#x200B;

\### The Offer

The company is a small-mid size startup in Minneapolis. The interview process was an easy take-home, a behavioral phone interview, and a few hours virtual onsite with the team leads and then the team itself. Compared to some of the processes I had gone through, this was pretty short and easy. During the interview, I got along well with everyone and asked a ton of questions which I think is what got me the offer (plus my take-home) since my answers to the more technical portions weren't extremely good or detailed. I really thought I wasn't going to get it because of that but I got the call! I guess that just goes to show you how important soft skills are.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Tips

\- The two of the three onsites I made it to (before one got cancelled) had take-home tests. Lots of people will tell you not to waste your time on them and if you have ANY experience I'd say you can probably skip them... But as someone who is just okay at Leetcode and bad at thinking on the spot / describing my projects / shit at interviewing in general, they were by far my best shot at showing my programming skills and instantly give you something to talk about / review with the interviewer.  

\- If you do decide to do a take-home, make sure to write plenty of tests... test the hell out of it. And if it's getting posted to GitHub, make sure the README is airtight.

\- I think new grads tend to have the best chances at FAANG and large companies (if you can Leetcode) or small startups (if you have a good personality / aren't afraid to talk to higher ups). I had zero success with mid-size companies anywhere and I wouldn't waste my time on them.

\###### Diagram Notes:

&amp;#x200B;

\- \*\*Ghosted\*\* means the company either reached out to setup some kind of interview and then did not respond when I gave dates/times to schedule OR gave me an interview and then never sent any kind of rejection  

\- \*\*Ignored\*\* means I ignored a request to schedule an interview either because I realized I actually did not want to work for them after I had applied OR they called to schedule something after I accepted my offer

\- \*\*Cancelled\*\* occurred when my onsite was cancelled by a company without a real rejection after doing very well throughout the rest of the process"

1568,cscareerquestions,How relevant are the notions of time and space complexity in the age of virtually infinite resources ?,"I’ve been writing a thesis on the evolution of software architecture for my Master’s degree and started to think about those notions that are very useful in software development.

Then I realized that those notions rose from the limited resources they had back in the day, but in the era of cloud, serverless, containerisation etc etc, and where resources are virtually infinite, are those concepts still relevant ?

On one hand, yes because wherever you are, you’ll still pay for the resources behind.
But on the other, the cost is so low that maybe the time spent on optimizing the algorithms doesn’t provide much savings.

Anyways, it’s just a topic for discussion I thought of earlier, let me know what you people think!"

To practice interviewing, I have been interviewing for other jobs since December of last year.




I'm honestly surprised at what I have seen in the interview process since then while applying for data and ML-related jobs.  I have seen startups with a huge number of steps in their interview process and long take home projects, intense technical interviews at bigger tech companies with no room for error, and companies that have historically asked easier questions asking more difficult leetcode questions.




At my level of experience, I feel like a new grad applying for jobs.  Also, I'm surprised at how little most companies care about what I accomplish at my current job compared to how I perform in a technical interview."

I’m currently a full-time CS student at an unremarkable university and, because my school doesn’t do traditional semesters, I plan to graduate this October/November timeframe. At the same time, I’m preparing to move to Australia in August or September (pending border exemption). 

This raises a couple different questions. I’m trying to balance school with learning languages, but I also probably need to start preparing for interviews? And working on personal projects? 

My main concern when I started this post was whether I should apply for remote new grad roles before graduation or if I should wait until after my move, but now I realize I don’t even know what to do to get to that point. It’s a unique situation as far as I can tell so I was hoping some more experienced people could provide some insight, and especially for any knowledge of CS careers in Australia and if the application landscape is as…strenuous as it appears to be in the US (with Leetcode, big portfolios, various languages and frameworks, etc). Also, I won’t be able to work in Australia for a minimum of three months after arrival (can’t work on a tourism visa), but I’d like to avoid that if possible (by working for a non-Australian company remotely). 

Another sort of concern is rumors of ageism in the CS world. I just retired from the military and, even though I’m not even in my 40s yet, it’ll be quite obvious that this is a second career and I feel like it won’t help me get a job. Is this an overreaction?

Tl;dr - graduating soon and moving to Australia shortly after. Wanting help refining my focus and striking a balance between job prep and schoolwork for the next few months, as well as advice on whether a remote new grad role for a US based company is best or if I should wait until I’m eligible to work in Australia. 

Appreciate any info y’all can provide. Have a great day."

1578,cscareerquestions,Advice needed for building a SaaS application using Flask!!!!!!!!,"Hi folks.

Hope you all are having a great time.

 After a long term of unemployment I have joined a company as a Python Developer. Currently I'm assigned on a SaaS project as a solo developer. I got a 60% complete MVP built using Flask (no documentation or nothing) as handover.  At first I was confused with which framework to select, since I wasn't aware about the exact requirements. At first I was pretty much convinced with FastAPI, but because of lack of educational materials  I thought I will go ahead with Flask.

The application consists of a hierarchical user group structure: Clients --&gt; Brands --&gt; Merchants --&gt; Customers, where Client is at top of the tree. The control flows from top to bottom, i.e only a Client can create a Brand and only a Brand can create a Merchant and so forth. Now each group will have one or more privileged users who can do CRUD operations and a bunch of read-only users. The SaaS application is supposed to serve all of these users with necessary access restrictions. 

Now my concerns:

Concern 1: This falls under multi-tenant application architecture. So how to achieve data isolation at each User group level?

Where I am: I looked into PostgreSQL Schema approach, database per client approach, etc. Now I am looking into containerizing the application and serve using Kubernetes and has to perform some sort of routing, but not sure how to achieve this. This would look like a set number of pods or a pod serving a client and whatever is under that client.

Concern 2: How to model Client, Brand, Merchant, Customer etc

Where I am: At first I thought this can be achieved by creating permission models with access levels, but haven't figured it out entirely.

Concern 3: Now I'm not even sure that I'm thinking right

So would like some advice or insights!!!!!!!!!!"
1579,cscareerquestions,Switching careers into SE. Thoughts on working an IT job beforehand?,"For the past 6 years, I've been an English teacher and am looking to switch into Software Engineering.

For the past year or so, I've been steadfastly building my programming skills by consuming massive amounts of literature on Python, HTML, CSS, Data Structures, Algorithms, and other essential topics.

I also have built some small projects, solve 1-2 LeetCode challenges per day, and am designing my next big project. I also have some novice to intermediate-level work on my GitHub.

I've been applying like crazy to junior-level SE jobs, as well as paid internships. Not much success, but one company said they might consider me for a ""Solutions Engineer"" position. It's basically a consultant and IT person for their company's software suite. But there's no coding at all. Salary is \~75k.

I'm comfortable (yet dissatisfied) with my current job, and I make six figures, am tenured and have a pension. I know I want to go into SE 100%, but is it worth leaving this job to take this IT position when it's not even what I'm really going for? Or would this IT job increase my prospects of getting a SE job in the near future?

TL;DR -- Switching careers into Software Engineering and might get a job offer as a tech consultant / IT guy. Would this job give me relevant, marketable and enriching experience for SE?"

I've always wanted to teach myself coding and I have always found the concept of software engineering/development to be very interesting, but that is obviously the route I didn't initially choose. I always said that I would have done CS/SwE if I hadn't gone the healthcare route. I was just wondering if you think I would need two degrees to be competitive.

1587,cscareerquestions,"Company just got bought out, I get a big backpay after being underpaid. I don't know how to feel about it.","Essentially, a big company bought my small company. They review my pay and gave me a big reimbursement(17k AUD) from being underpaid. This is my first job.

I did ask for a raise. I knew that I was underpaid, but I'm living on a visa and is still studying working casual only so there wasn't much I can do about it (graduation in 3 months ) But I think the company realise that it's getting to me and I was going to leave after I finish my study if this continue. And they have increase my salary to an above average rate and give me the payback mentioned above. 

I'm not sure how business work. Why and how did they come up with this decision?

But I really don't know if I should feel happy or angry about it.  They underpaid me that whole time and because they knew I need them for my visa. I wish people know what kind of things foreigner like me have to put up, sacrifice with to stay in a different country. I'm angry with the culture that encourage teamworks while some people in the group are underpaid. The more I talk to the other folks, the more I felt like there was something wrong with me that I was a failure because I  got less pay. But at the same time, I know that I'm incredibly lucky especially at a foreigner to get a job during uni. I started out as an intern with this company and progress to a casual role and they offered me a full time role after I graduate. I do get along well with the people I work with. This is today news, but before that I was really wondering wether if I should leave. If I don't leave now, I have to bet on this company for my future visa plan and stay for at least 3-4 years (yep). And if I leave, I really don't know if other companies'd be any better and this will be a huge bet.

1591,cscareerquestions,"Am I the only one who doesn't like the hype around IT? It seems to me that the value of a programmer will become many times less, as it is already happening in Asia.","Today's world is becoming more digital, and people are becoming much more modern.   


I am sure that the demand for programmers will not diminish in years. **But it seems to me that the value of a programmer will become many times less.**

Just look at it, people are trying to sell you some kind of programming course on every single corner. They promise that you will become a *FAANG* employee in just 24 hours, which hooks up many people. Thousands of new programming schools, bootcamps are opening every single day. It's even a school subject in many countries today. And itself programming becomes simpler and simpler every year, many new tools are developed, that are easier to work with and so on. 

I really think that software is useful and demand for it will last forever.   
But I feel that in 20 years or so it will be a lot easier and no more than a *conveyor belt job*. Because the hype is huge and everyone and their children will become so familiar with it. And it's even easier to get in the field than ever before, everyone can afford a computer today. You don't even necessarily have to move somewhere.

You can even see that in many counties **already**, programming has very little value.  
Developers are already viewed as **blue-collar level** in countries like: *China*, *India*, *Japan*. On average *Senior Developers* earn there *2.5*\-*3* times less than *Doctors* for example.   
Right now I am studying computer science in my first year. Having all these thoughts. I feel very insecure about what I do or the university I study at.  
Even if I drop out of university, I don't really see where to go after that.   
Don't like or even afraid of where it goes and don't know what to do instead"
1592,cscareerquestions,[Serious] Need career advice - People who entered their field with a degree/no degree,"Currently I’m 20 years old going into my sophomore year of college this upcoming fall. I’m suppose to be a junior this upcoming semester but had to take a way less credits for a couple of semesters due to reasons I couldn’t control. (I have credits towards my sophomore year but not enough for my junior year)

I originally wanted to go into the cybersecurity field and I started my eMajor in cybersecurity in 2019-2020. But as time went on I found less interest in that. And recently transferred to another school and decided to change to a computer science major. Although I’m not completely sure I wanted to continue my degree, I just don’t feel like college is for me. 

A quick disclaimer, for these last 2-3 years during school I have been taking short cuts with my programming assignments. Getting help from others or other sources online. I feel like I have a basic understanding but no real experience in any languages or fundamentals. I want to learn and do assignments/projects for myself but I consistently lack the motivation and discipline. Taking that into part I need help as where I should go from here. 

I currently have in interest in going into web design, but no prior experience. Also I’m not sure if I should go into front end, back end, or full stack. I’m not big into art/design, which I think front end devs need. I’m mostly an introverted person as well but I want to step out my comfort zone. I want to be able have a good paying job and to have flexibility to be able to work from home and not always in an office setting.

But what I really want to know is should I continue with my cybersecurity degree, or take the route of doing a boot camp and building my certifications and getting real world experience. 
 
What steps would I need to take if I don’t continue with my degree to be successful in the future. Without college and a degree it seems harder to make connections, get internships, and get job opportunities that require a degree. Are there any boot camps that provides you with a mentor, and opportunities to make connections and get internships, etc? 

If someone has been down this path before or knows what I should do please let me know."

I recently accepted a job offer for a very large, well-known, global cybersecurity company as a malware researcher. The entire process thus far has been fantastic -- I have already have a start date and put in my two weeks notice last week with my current employer.  


I've already submitted all onboarding paperwork and the only thing left that I am waiting on is my background check to clear (being done by 3rd party [https://www.ebiinc.com/](https://www.ebiinc.com/)) . It has been hanging on ""County Criminal History"" for 6 business days now and I am worried there is some sort of issue as I did get into some slight legal trouble roughly 3 years ago as I was arrested for a DWI (under influence of xanax). Also had a possession of controlled substance charge that same night although after working with a lawyer this should have been dismissed and the DWI should be the only serious charge on my record to my knowledge. I also have a handful of traffic violation tickets and ended up having my car repossesed (not sure if this matters). Since then, I have not had any trouble with the law at all and have no intentions to.  


I was originally not too worried as I have gone through two background checks with two other companies since then although as time goes on and things continue to remain stagnant without progress, I am starting to wonder what's going on. My fear is that they will reject me and I will be out of a job since I already put in my notice.

1604,cscareerquestions,"Information Systems soon-to-be graduate, want to pursue SWE; go back for second degree in CS or self-teach?","Hi all,

I'm currently completing a (business) degree in Information Systems, graduating this fall from a school that FAANG visits and hosts the state's largest hackathon. I'd like to pursue software engineering as a career after realizing I want to go more technical than what my degree has provided me with. It's too late for me to add a CS minor.

I have a good foundation with very basic Java (loops, arrays, classes, basic OOP) and SQL (nothing crazy, 8-10 line queries at most). My final classes will involve Python and R as well, though again nothing really too technical. Finishing each of these ""programming"" classes has always left me with an itch to go more advanced and complex. I know nothing about data structures and algorithms or any advanced topics beyond that, but I'm confident that I could really get good at them and I would say I'm great at absorbing textbooks and self-teaching.

I'm considering going back to complete a second degree in CS immediately after I graduate. Assuming I begin January '22, I would most likely finish the degree in December '23. It would cost \~$13,000 (not an issue but I wouldn't mind avoiding it). I'm also considering just self teaching with textbooks and free courses, but I'm not sure how long I would take until I'm confident that I'm close to the level of a CS graduate. Am I overthinking the worth of the CS degree and the abilities of its graduates? Because I've heard that most of the content learned in a CS degree is not applicable to most job positions. Would I find better value in teaching myself the essential concepts, hammering them and completing personal projects? I know data structures and algorithms are the main thing, but what should I learn beyond that, assuming I do go the self-teaching route? Would having both degrees be more attractive to employers? I simply worry that I wouldn't be able to compete against CS grads for the high-tier SWE positions.

Thank you all in advance."

I'm 1y8m into a Junior Unity Developer job at a small company that only had 5 people when I joined them and is now at 16 employees. The company does mostly contract work for industrial/educational VR (virtual reality). The pay is probably suboptimal (this is in Poland) but the work environment and coworkers are great. 

I now have multiple Unity VR as well as AR apps under my belt, some i constructed by myself from the ground up, everything outside of graphics (models and UI). Others i worked with a team simultaneously either working with an already made core gameplay loop or made one myself to be used by others to make components. 

It's been a great experience and i enjoy it quite a lot however the nature of contract work like this is that nothing is ambitious. The projects are small. The systems aren't overly complex and nothing is really designed and produced above the minimum required most often.

Another issue is that even my senior wasn't exactly experienced in anything outside of this either and i feel that i have learned pretty much all that i can from this company and am slowly, probably around the 2 - 2,5y mark, going to look for better opportunities to bring my career forward.

**Questions**

I am currently doing the Mathematics for Computer Science MIT OCW 6.042J course to then do intro to algorithms 6.006 to polish up my theoretical knowledge but i would like to ask a couple things about what to do next.

Outside of algorithms what do recruiters for Unity developers or game developers in general look for so that i can be better prepared for my next step. 

What would the next step be outside of becoming a full on Unity developer. Do you think that staying with Unity forwards is a good idea (i do plan on staying with game dev at least for now so going into SWE is off the table for now), or should I try going for custom engine companies/unreal?

And finally, anyone have experience with Unity dev positions in Germany/Austria? What would you expect of a Unity Developer?

Cheers."

I'm currently enrolled at an Arkansas university and have grown up in a very rural area most of my life. I fell victim to the ""Just go to college and get your degree! Computer science? If you get a degree in that, you're set for life!"" trap. The reality is, I don't think I have nowhere near enough coding experience and knowledge to be anywhere near ready enough to qualify for even a basic internship.

I don't know anything about hashmaps, binary trees, I barely understand OOP, Big O notation... All these terms I've seen in ""coding interview"" videos online just make me so incredibly anxious because I have no idea what anyone is talking about. I've only got extremely basic C++ and assembly (for some reason) to show for my education.

I genuinely am dumbfounded as for what I am supposed to do. I should be at an internship right now. But I'm not.

No, not all ""data engineers"" have the same skill set. No, I don't want to get on a call with you to find out that I don't have the 5+ years of experience with a specific tech stack your hiring manager is looking for.

1629,cscareerquestions,"I have been offered a junior role at a AAA game company, as well as being recognized as a great fit for a company waiting for confirmation on their next project, but I'm not sure what I should do?","I'm a soon-to-be graduating student and I've been offered an ""independent contractor"" role as a junior programmer for a AAA games company, I have 2 weeks to respond to the offer but I am considering waiting for the result of another non-gamedev role.

After telling the second company about the first offer they have confirmed that they think I'm a great fit but are waiting to close a deal for a project before bringing me on.

Each company works with Unreal engine and C++ which is what I want to specialise in, but I'm indifferent to whether the work is on games or not.


I definitely want to work for the second company as there are way fewer potential downsides, but I'm not sure what I should do as waiting for a response may leave me without a job offer at all.

Here are the positives and negatives for each company.

## First company: 

Positives:

1. Would be great to have experience with a AAA games company from the get-go and would be great for my resume. It would open much more opportunities for work especially at higher-paying jobs overseas.

2. I'm likely to learn more compared to the second company due to working in teams with senior software engineers.

3. The company is expanding to handle another game project, so there's a chance for rapid role progression in the company.

4. All reviews (even negative ones) say that your fellow team members are all lovely and passionate people (with regular social events etc).

5. Workers rarely do overtime or crunch which is rare for a game company. 


Negatives:

1. The pay is quite below average even for a games company and is the same pay of a standard salaried rate even though it's actually a year-long independent contractor position. This means there's no extra compensation for the fact that I have to pay my own taxes, have no set time off, no job protections, etc.

2. The management has bad reviews (difficult CEO, favoritism, inconsistency with project management, blaming, ""heartless hr"" and more) so the company has a high turnover rate. They say they are making changes to better these problems but obviously, I can't count on that.

4. The contract seems to mitigate all risk on their side while offering basically nothing to balance these terms.

5. The company is based in a different city and the move would be a huge change for my life, as I do not know anyone there. So it would be a huge risk to move and take the job weighing in the other factors as well.


## Second company: 

Positives:

1. Management seems very good. They are open to ideas, approachable, and support their teams with positive reinforcement.  

2. They are a company that is heavily reliant on artists/tech-artists and have about 15+ artists with only 2 intermediate programmers, so there is also potential for rapid role growth within the programming side of the company.

3. Pay will most likely be much better starting out since it's not in games and they are a smaller-sized company that is looking to expand to be able to complete more projects.

4. They are located in my current city so I wouldn't have to move.

5. The team is also filled with sociable and passionate people, and they are encouraged to ask others for help across teams and even projects.

Negatives:

1. The job isn't confirmed, so waiting for the result may make me lose out on the first job without guaranteeing I get this one.

2. I will probably learn at a slower pace as I'm not working with a team of senior programmers/engineers.

3. Working for a lesser-known company may make me lose out on better jobs opportunities in the future or slow my career progression.

4. Fast-paced work environment which requires good productivity at all times. May lead to burnout.


I'm not sure if I should attempt to renegotiate a better contract with the first company to make it balanced enough to weigh out some of the negatives, but it seems unlikely they would agree to the terms considering they seem to have plenty of hiring options. 
I'm not sure if a potentially toxic work environment is worth the risk even if it's a great opportunity.

1639,cscareerquestions,What does agility say about fixing a team with bad teamwork?,"I got my computer science degree this year. I did an internship at a credit union and while the organisation is huge, the team was nice and productive. Once my internship was over, they offered me a permanent job, which I accepted. Since teleworking will inevitably end at some point, I asked to switch team for one that's based in a city I want to move to.

The problems started when I joined the new team. There is a lot more red tape, the project owner and scrum master have no technical knowledge and are obsessed with doing agile perfectly. Each hour of work tracked, rigid planning, constant estimation of time remaining. They feel this is necessary because the team was consistently failing to reach their goals and agility is based on data. I'm pretty certain I'm losing 50% of my work hours in pointless meetings where I have no useful input and that don't concern me.

Then there are the other devs. There's no one with an ounce of leadership, yet they argue about every single detail endlessly. There's always one guy who wants to adopt the ""best practices in the industry""... which aren't applicable at all in our company. People are having flamewars in code reviews. There's so much turnover, you're considered senior with one year in the team. Also, the discussions are so slow because one of the guy has the habit of explaining everything tangentialy related to the subject before getting to the core issue. Feels like a rambling old man stuck in the body of a 30 years old.

So, decisions take ages because we need consensus and we can't appoint a leader because that goes against agility Every retrospective we complain about spending too much time in meetings, yet nothing changes. In fact, more meetings are called to find the root cause of the problem, but no one acts on it because no one is explicitely made responsible of implementing solutions.

This isn't what I signed in for. I feel miserable at work and I each time I suggest loosening up the processes, I get told this goes against agility policies and that it wasn't working in the past anyway. It's been two months since I joined that team and I completed 4 tasks... I just can't stand all that inefficiency. It's not even that the people are rude, they just have terrible work compatibility. Outside of work they're quite pleasant to talk to.

I’m 22, only have 1 years worth of college credits. I feel way behind but I also have 2 toddlers, work full time to pay for our house, cars, etc, so it’s hard to goto school full time. Originally my plan was to shoot to finish my degree by the time my daughter starts K5 (she’s 2). It could take me a little longer as I’m only able to handle maybe 9 max credits per semester. 

Background : I’ve taken Harvard’s CS50x, had a pretty tough time but learned a lot. Took Rayan Slim’s Java bootcamp on Udemy, and made it halfway through Angela Yu’s JavaScript bootcamp. 

I would love to finish school and pursue my career the traditional way but I feel like times getting away quick. If you were in my shoes what would you do?

So what are some good programs that I actually have a chance of getting into? I assume you need some credentials to figure out what qualifies as 'having a chance at', so here we go: I have I think a 4.0-4.1 weighted GPA and a 3.85-3.9 unweighted.

1644,cscareerquestions,[Asking for advice] Reaching out to my former supervisor boss for 100% work remote,"hi guys,

Need help in terms of reaching out to my former supervisor boss. 

I've been working in a company (it is divided into two groups, company A &amp; B) for two years and now the company splits up.

I am mainly working as a BI data analyst and a lot of my clients are company B. Company B is Sweden-based, company A is American-based. For some reason, I found that I am more connected with the team and the people more in Company B (and lots of clients in company B seem to like me too).

My boss lets call him Bob (from company A), and his boss (let's call him Josh, someone from company B) offered a 100% working remote position before last year, which is the same position (BI data Analyst) Honestly, I don't like working for Bob very much, he wants me to create a prediction model but pay me as a BI analyst. 

I rejected it because:

1. Bob seems to want to take advantage of this opportunity to write a new job responsibility to HR which will involve a more advanced analytic (create prediction model, etc) which I am not comfortable with. 

2. I have to follow their time zone (12 hours difference)

3. Either way, at that time, I'd still have to report to Bob

If I knew that the company will be splitting, I would not think twice to take the opportunity because I won't be working for Bob. I believe the time zone can be negotiable. 

But when I told Bob, I only mention reason # 2 because I was not comfortable telling #1, #3, and #4. 

And then they found someone, which is pretty much a BI analyst too, someone who is less experienced than me and no experience in creating predictions whatsoever. 

I am wondering if emailing Josh (my ex-boss) would be a good idea - expressing my interest to join his team and what would be the best way to approach this. I heard from their team, they might hire someone in Feb next year. 

I'd love to be 100% remote and have a chance to work temporarily in Sweden someday. My current working arrangement is still not clear, I have expressed interest in 100% remote many times, and my boss is still being vague about it. 

Thank you, guys!"

1647,cscareerquestions,Second BS in compsci vs. self-taught through The Odin Project?,"Hello! I've been researching and researching, and it feels like the rabbit hole gets deeper with every link I click. 

I'm 27. I graduated from on online program with a 3.1 GPA and have my BS in a very vague ""computer studies"" degree. Because my entire four years were online, I actually had very little interaction with my professors. It was designed to be very self paced and there wasn't a lot of hands-on teaching.

Now I am regretting the decisions my younger self made because I'm struggling to find work that's related to the tech industry at all. It was meant to be an IT degree, but it... wasn't. There's a ton of junior developer positions in my area, though, so I'd like to get back into computer science. I've taken a handful of introductory programming courses, as well as some discreet math and Calc 1 &amp; 2. I enjoyed them, and have always enjoyed coding, but it took me a few years to realize that.

I started to consider going back for a BS in compsci, but I read that it looks worse to have two BS degrees than just pursuing a master's degree. I'm not sure I can even qualify for a master's program, however, because I have zero options for a letter of recommendation, let alone the three most colleges seem to require. Like I said, I had almost zero interaction with my previous professors, and I am currently still laid off from the pandemic. I could ask my previous boss for a letter of recommendation, but I've had two jobs since high school, and one of those companies shut down long ago. I could maybe scrounge up one letter, but this pretty much leads me to believe that an MS program is not a strong option.

I've considered some other options as well. A coding boot camp is one option, though I continue to read that the quality of most boot camps rapidly plummets every year.

My other option was to teach myself, and while it's absolutely achievable, I do enjoy and thrive in the more rigid environment that a program's curriculum can offer me. I am currently eyeing the Odin Project, but I'm not 100% sure that web development is my goal. I would like to one day work in the gaming industry, though that isn't necessarily my starry eyed dream. I would be pretty content just working as a software developer for any random company.

Sorry for the wall of text! I'm feeling pretty overwhelmed by all these different options and I tend to ramble. Thank you for taking the time to read and I look forward to reading this community's insight!"

I've had a few unsuccessful interviews, but I've never coded before in my life prior to school, am I'm hanging in my classes by the skin of my teeth, and feel as if the interviewers are shocked I was able to go to this school.

Aside from the imposter syndrome, I wanted some input from some professionals or peers about my unpaid coding internship at a start-up. (P.S. I'm a junior) Turns out, I'm the only technical intern, and I have to constantly ask for meetings with my manager to ask for relevant work. In the past 2 months, I've had only 2 meetings with MY manager, but have been constantly pushed off to speak with the sales manager. I'm assigned the same work with the other sales interns to cold-call for clients. I've voiced my displeasure with them many times, and have gotten conflicting messages from management. 

I'm overall really disappointed in my current experience, but have 2 months before school starts again. While this internship was unpaid, I blew off another paid internship in a totally irrelevant industry because my academic advisor said that an internship at least involving CS was more impressive than one that I wouldn't be able to put on my resume. 

I don't want to quit because I'll have a huge blank on my resume, but I don't know what to do anymore. My friends who have already graduated all say to just quit and play around this summer, but I'm very concerned that I won't be able to find employment, especially since so much on my resume is irrelevant to CS.

Would I be able to find a job with just my degree in ME, unrelated job experience and a lot of personal projects?

Which CS track will be the easiest for me to find a job with higher pay then I make now ($62,000)?

Which CS track will it be easiest to find a remote job?"

1663,cscareerquestions,No diploma. How much of a handicap ?,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my situation:

\- 4 YOE doing backend enterprise, early 30's

\- Am currently in Europe

\- Aiming to work for a US company and move to a low-tax country like UAE to get better compensation (aiming 6 figures+) for a few years

\- Currently in freelance, quite happy with it and can afford to keep doing that for a long time (open source domain so good visibility) while looking for high-paying job

\- Have the opportunity to complete a diploma very cheaply, doing it long-distance (only 2 years left)

&amp;#x200B;

My problem is, I'm not sure it would be worth it at this point to pursue a Bachelors in C. Sc. Problem is opportunity cost: I can spend all that time grinding leetcode, writing blogposts, doing more/better OS work for my portfolio.

What do you think ? Will not having a diploma come bite me in the ass at some point, or should I just go ahead and concentrate on getting a high-earning US job ASAP ?"
1664,cscareerquestions,"Graduated last year, considering enlisting in the army and having some questions (non US)","Hello,

I graduated in September with a masters in Computer Science. I have been considering since a long time enlisting, but up to now, I preferred completing my studies (uni is free in my country). I also did an internship in a research lab in defence industry during my last year.

After graduating, I got a programming job in a big local company, but I am rather unsatisfied by it. I've been interested in becoming an officer in the army because I am looking for a more generalist and not exclusively technical job. But most importantly, I have had an interest in geopolitics for a long time, and being an officer would allow me to take part in defending my country and in deployments. This appeals to me more than a ""code monkey"" software developer job.

I talked to a recruiter, who told me that there could be a possibility to enlist as a network specialist officer, in a signals unit. The position offers similar pay and benefits to a private sector job in my country, and there is the possibility of being deployed (something I'm looking for). The job also includes administrative and managerial duties.

My question is: would you think this is a sensible move (considering roughly equal pay and benefits)? Wouldn't it be a problem to be a network specialist officer when I have a background in programming (especially if I deploy)?"
1665,cscareerquestions,Refresh of CS concepts?,"Hello, I've worked as a software engineer and then later a software engineering manager in this company for around 3.5 years. I have around 18 hours outside my work every week that I could spend exploring new concepts.

I'm wondering if it's worth it to use that time to revisit and refresh my knowledge on algorithms first before diving into these specialized subjects. Part of the reason I think it's a good idea is because a lot of companies interview using algorithm and data structure questions, and I wanna have that base steadfast in case I need to interview in the future.  


If you think it's worth it to have a refresher coarse, do you have a track or coarse that you recommend online or should I just pick a concept and go after it?"

1669,cscareerquestions,How bad would it be to quit my job to take some time off and prep for a better one?,"I have 10+ YOE in tech. I've been working remotely past 2.5 years since we lived at a tier-3 city in the US before moving to the Bay with limited tech opportunities. Job has been okay growth wise, but company seems a few years away from going big, if at all. Plus, I take strong objections to recently hired senior management's leadership styles which conflicts with my value system. 

Having moved to the tech hub in the Bay, I've been trying to take time in my day to prep for better job opportunities - but, have been miserably failing due to lack to time and energy. Having a busy work life and an active toddler, leaves fewer hours after work to focus on prep.

Overall, I'm mentally and emotionally drained. Tried taking few days off didn't help much.

Originally my plan was to go to Dallas because my job has an office there, its bigger and one of my goals is to buy multiple rental properties and Dallas seems to have cheaper options. I went to dallas for about 4.5 days to look at houses and decided to go to austin for another 4.5 days as a mini vacation for myself since i hadnt traveled since January of 2020. 

The thing is, once i got to Austin i loved it. I liked Dallas as well but not as much as austin. I like places with natural view and austin has plenty of it. I decided to look at a few houses and Austin had plenty of really nice options a little outside of the city around my price range. I also noticed san antonio has a lot of cheap options for houses where i am now considering getting rental property if i decide on austin.

Im a software engineer in my mid 20s,in terms of my career what city would be best? 

I see austin has alot of the big time companies (amazon, apple, tesla,etc), but dallas has more high level security companies (which is the field i currently work in but i dont mind working on different type of tech while im still young)."

In in my second year doing computer science and started applying for internships to gain some experience and something to put on my resume.

I've looked through some websites, but most internships only accept local students, and the few that do are highly competitive, so my options are very scarce. I just applied for Optiver the other day, passed the coding challenge, but just heard back from my behavioural interview and was a rejection unfortunately which made me feel depressed and shitty about myself. But despite that I tried to look to apply for more companies, but can't seem to find too many, since, again, most companies do not accept international students.

1682,cscareerquestions,BoCS Graduate: AWS CSA vs Deloitte Digital Developer,"Hi all,

I'm about to finish my Bachelor of Computer Science and have 2 offers, AWS CSA Graduate role and .NET / Sitecore Graduate at Deloitte Digital. To be honest, I really love coding and I'm not fond of a customer support role at all.

My family and friends are encouraging me to take the AWS CSA roles because of the higher pay (40k AUD more), networking opportunity and career development that I could possibly make. For me, the only reason why I would consider AWS is the amount of knowledge about Cloud I'm gonna learn.

Would it be better to choose the CSA role and try to switch to SE/Cloud Engineer internally at AWS or should I choose a developer role at Deloitte and go from there?

Suppose that I choose the CSA role, is it harder to go for a SE role afterwards or HR would prefer it since I have cloud experience?"

1686,cscareerquestions,"Worked in a different industry for a year, can’t find a job now","Hello all, I apologize if my questions have been covered extensively before, I haven’t quite been able to find answers.

I graduated with a BS in comp sci from a top 20 CS school (per USNews) last summer with a slightly sub 3.0 GPA. I never did any internships and didn’t make time to build a portfolio in college, but I did work part time all the way through college and held some substantial leadership roles.

Last summer I took the first job I could get after graduating to pay the bills, which was a sales and logistics role, I had a minor leadership role there and have a pretty good description of the time management and problem solving skills it required on my resume. I resigned because I didn’t want to pursue sales long term and it was too time consuming to allow me to pursue a different career.

Now, I can’t seem to even get an interview for SWE roles, even the lower paying ones (I’m looking primarily on the East coast), and I don’t know what to do. I understand the degree itself doesn’t prove I’m a good programmer, but I thought it would be enough to at least get me some interviews.

What steps do I need to take to become hireable? I am beginning to work on a portfolio but I know that’s going to take months to be worth much, I need to pay my bills so I can’t really dedicate weeks or months to a bootcamp.

Are there any jobs that are at least in the same field I can get with my degree alone? What are they and how do I look for them? I am okay with not being an SWE right out of the gate if that’s not feasible at the moment but that is my long term goal and I want to try and at least steer my short term career path back in that direction."
1687,cscareerquestions,"Leaving a 16 month internship, but only 4 months in?","Hey everyone,

So I'm a Canadian student whose interning for 16 months with a company, but 4 months in I am seriously thinking of quitting. The main reason why I'm unhappy is here is I'm finding the work very dull (writing small Bash scripts automating things and editing config files all day), and I worry it won't help when actually trying to find SWE full time jobs when I graduate (btw my current internship isn't even SWE, its more IT/sysadmin). So I'm struggling justifying why I should stay for an additional 12 months. 

I took this internship because I was having trouble getting some call backs, and this was better than nothing. Anyways, I've greatly improved my resume with a few additional cool side projects (plus some actual work experience), so I've been thinking of applying for internships for Fall 2021 and if I can get an offer, then quit my current internship. 

Of course the only problem is that backing out of a 16 month internship while only 4 months in is very bad form. From my university as far as I can tell, there should be no repercussions for doing so. 

Any advice on what I should do?"

I  did two internships during my time in college: one was remote, while  the other was in-person. I liked both for different reasons... on one  hand, I enjoyed not having to commute, while on the other, I enjoyed  grabbing lunch with co-workers. I also liked having a distinct  separation between work and home, but I also liked being able to step  away from my computer and do chores around the house.   


While I definitely think I prefer one location (NYC) over the other, I've  actually lived in San Francisco, whereas NYC I've only experienced as a  tourist and through movies. I'm worried that working remote will hinder my career growth and be disadvantageous when switching jobs somehow.  


Also,  how do you meet new people? I'm admittedly really scared of moving to  either of these cities alone and don't really know where to start  finding people to hang out with...

While I've ""technically"" taken a Cloud Computing and a Databases course, I honestly feel like I didn't learn much more than a basic 101 tutorial on the internet. Next year is when recruiting really steps up and I want to flesh out my knowledge of the technologies I list on my resume more by getting more involved.

I want to get more familiar with what I already know, but so far all my research has just been like ""here make a machine learning model as a side project"" with no real additional guidance (and if I'm unfamiliar with the particular topic might as well be in a different language) or a step-by-step tutorial for a beginner. I'm trying to find projects that are more in between, with enough guidance to help me find my way but open ended enough that I can be creative and figure out the bugs on my own, without just copy pasting code from a tutorial.

Last time I took math was in high school and got a 5 on AP Cal, Physics, and Stat.

Here are the reasons

- Hired me as a backend developer and after a week told me to work on frontend.
- No Guidance from Senior developers
- Not giving me access to Jira board and constantly pinging me on slack to complete the task (WTF? I don't know the task yet). This happened for 3-4 days.
- After giving me permissions to view the board, setting unrealistic tasks (They know that I'm an intern &amp; TBH, I was looking for internships to enhance my skills, If I was already skilled then why would I join an internship?)
- Not even reviewing my code/PR
- Ghosting me on skype
- Tight Deadlines (Their words ""Ok, learn this new technology but don't spend too much time on it and do this task"", I'm not a smart person, I have to read a concept thrice or four times if I don't understand it)

I know how to leave on good terms and I also understand the importance of not burning bridges, and I don't have any problems with that. Yet in this ""soon-to-be-previous-job"". Yet my boss did mislead the company and project in many ways. Scope creeping, micromanaging, and we've warned and tried to establish many deadlines across the project lifespan with no consideration from his side (which a couple of times ended up exploding in our faces).

I had an important role as a dev lead for 2.5 years (and others) thus by leaving I will leave a pretty big hole behind, and the next person who will take my place will have to cope with all of this mismanagement. I'm afraid that if I leave without telling my boss all the wrong things he did and how to improve them will ""enable"" him to keep his behavior and limited vision of the company, yet he is a very impulsive person and I'm not sure how he will take it.

He is my second manager in 9 months. 

I moved across the country to take this role, so I didn’t know any of the customers and the company didn’t have any relationships with any of their customers to introduce me. They also lost trust with the largest customer in the territory by changing their product for the worse, denying it, coming out with an improved version, that literally showing the same problem, and now they have started actually improving the product. Needless to say, that customer is likely lost at the end of this year due to lost trust.

I am 19, I've been writing software for a while (since early middle school). I started off with C++, learned reverse engineering a bit, did graphics programming, UI development, etc. Around the end of highschool I realized that kind of work is ""specialized"", and really hard for a young guy with no degree to get a job with regardless of skill, so I started learning web development with VueJS, NodeJs, MongoDb, etc. I have been applying to anything on Indeed with the word ""intern"" or ""developer"" or ""web"" in it, and I've gotten 2 interviews so far in the last 2-3 months. First one was way out of my league (idk why they even bothered with me) and the second one, they interviewed me for an internship position that was already filled. Probably dodged a bullet there but anyways...

I don't know what else I can be/should be doing, I just want to make money with the many skills I've worked hard to learn. I have a personal website/portfolio with a few projects on it ( here: [https://lunaranomaly.com](https://lunaranomaly.com/)), from there you are able to download my resume and a link to my github if you feel like reviewing it.

I've also started trying to freelance (as of today, I re-made my [Freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com/) profile) and the kinds of jobs being posted on there are just, from what I can gather, either gatekept by the site itself or they are complete wastes of time; for instance, people wanting to hire someone to complete their coursework for them. It's obviously low quality, and low return. I also have done every step of creating an Upwork account besides upload a profile picture which I'll be doing tomorrow, once I get some sleep and don't look such a mess :P

I've just been fed up lately, I don't know what to do or what I am doing wrong, which is why I am here.

My questions are: 

 Am I advertising myself to the wrong people? 

Am I applying on the wrong websites (such as Indeed)? 

What am I mucking up? 

Its really hard for me to tell these things as I am only 19, and never had a dev job, so I lack the relevant experience to know what it is that I don't know.

TL;DR: I've been trying to get a dev job for the last 2 months and I feel like I am shooting blanks with my resume/portfolio, not sure what the issue is but I know I am lacking something to attract employers.

Thank you for taking the time to read, and if you have any questions, advice, or critiques I will be very responsive to all and it would be \*greatly\* appreciated!

1715,cscareerquestions,Data structures and algorithms in Ruby?,"I am out of college and have been working as a software engineer for about 3 years at a small company. I am looking to the future, and want to move in the next 8 months - 1 year.

We primarily work in Ruby. I am wondering if any of you have used Ruby for technical interviews at the big FAANG companies (in particular Amazon)? (I know people hate Amazon here but that's not what I'm asking)

I know that Python is a very popular interview language, and Ruby is quite similar, so I assume that Ruby will be fine to use for and to practice/learn DS&amp;A.

I also know that these languages do obfuscate some of the actual functionality of the code, but if I explain my logic, and don't use the auto built in methods for coding questions, will I be alright?

In college we used C++. I've forgotten so much of my DS&amp;A, so it's going to be a grind either way."

1717,cscareerquestions,professor says development is boring and we should not choose it as a path.,"hello everyone, so i am currently in the end of first in IT college and w have to choose a path from the following 3:

1. development (web, mobile, ..)
2. networking
3. embedded systems

i really like development and I've already started learning by myself technologies and languages that my college doesn't even teach.

but today my  networking professor said that development path sucks and we should not focus on it because the developers in the future will always get bored and change the path and that in the future, in work, it is easy to teach a networking guy programming and make him a developer than teaching a programmer networking.

i wanted to know if even some of what she said is true and weather if development path is better or not.

PS: i also liked networking (at least what we learned) but i love development more."

1719,cscareerquestions,"Honestly, how easy it to get an offer from AMZ?","This subreddit seems to think it's absolute cake to get in to Amazon, but I've been watching experience videos on YouTube, and the process still seems quite involved.

There seems to be an initial HackerRank screening with two questions, if you pass that then you get a technical phone interview, then if you pass that, you get invited to a four hour onsite which has multiple behavioral and technical questions. One story I read, the guy didn't perform well on a single question and was denied.

This still seems like a difficult/stressful process.

I know this subreddit hates Amazon, so I don't know if the circlejerk is putting Amazon down by calling it easy and no skill, or if the process is actually simple and everyone gets a job... they just get PIP'd in a year.

Please genuinely give me your thoughts if you have an Amazon interview within the last few years. I would appreciate honest feedback on the process."
1720,cscareerquestions,Are computer sciences something you would reccomend to a 16 year old about to sit for his IGCSE's? And is it possible to get into Foundation/Ausmat for Computer Science without having taken Additional Mathematics? How safe exactly is this field from all developments long term,"Alright, just to be clear, I understand one must go through extreme struggle no matter what fields he picks, my simple question is if Computer Sciences (I'll refer to it as CS for this post) is similar, or significantly harder in terms of keeping up with competition. I was planning to go into engineering, but its been awhile now and I doubt I'm good at physics, so I'm reconsidering my fields cause I dont want to screw up my options

I looked into the IGCSE requirments for Computer Science, and I realised alot of the fields require Additional Mathematics too, something I didn't pick. I'm not an idiot in maths, but I do struggle sometimes with long equations, so I figure that will be my first hurdle. So is maths going to be heavily ingrained into CS, or would I be able to get by even if I'm not that great at it.

That aside, I've heard alot of people say that coding langauges are extremely difficult, like REALLY HARD. I'm not the best with making websites or programming an Access database, but I think I have a certain aptitude for it, and while a coding language is a massive step up from websites, I feel like I may enjoy computer sciences a tad bit more than engineering. Do most people have regret getting into this field too, or did I just meet the wrong people.

Also, where exactly would you reccomend I do the university courses; I live in Malaysia, and am considering studying in either australia or canada, though domestic is no issue to me too. The pre-univeristy course I've currently picked is either Foundation or AUSMAT or A-Level; is this fine for getting into CS, or would you guys reccomend using a different pre-univeristy course entirely.

The subjects I've picked for my IGCSE are: History, English, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, ICT, Business.

Speaking of business, is the tech industry a field that will still be really open to new univeristy graduates 5 years from now, or is it already very packed with extreme competition (the sites I've read don't seem to mention this). And are the jobs well paying in this field, or would I be struggling with odd-jobs for the rest of my life by getting into this

Lastly, would it be possible to get close to the video game industries with a CS or Software Engineering degree of some sort, or is that something I can only enter with a Digital Animation course (something which I do not plan on getting into because I lack the creativity and skill required).

&amp;#x200B;

Here is an attempt to condense my rambling into something worthwhile

1. Would Computer Science (CS) still be a viable course open to new graduates 5 years from now? Or is it already jam-packed
2. Is IGCSE Add-Maths extremely neccesary for applying into CS pre-univeristy, or is it something you think you can get by without having taken. And how deeply linked is maths to ICT.
3. What pre-university course is best for CS, would A-level/Ausmat be fine? And would you reccomend studying overseas or is domestic fine (I'm fine either way)
4. Would it be possible to get involved in video-game industries through CS or software engineering courses?
5. If I enjoyed making basic websites through HTML and expression webs, is there a teeny weeny chance I'd enjoy learning the neccesary coding languages, or is that just WAYYYYYY up there
6. Would I spend the rest of my life doing odd-jobs with CS or is it only moderately difficult to get a good-paying job with enough experience
7. In your estimate, how long exactly would it take to work in CS jobs before being able to support yourself fully with time to spare
8. And do you spend the rest of your life working non-stop in computer programming, or is there a good portion of free time no matter where you go

Sorry if the questions sound stupid and basic, and sorry if they sound unrealistic, but I as a 16 year old only have half a year before having into pre-univeristy, so I am quite confused at the moment despite trying to do research into this. If you have any advice you'd like to add on, just go for it and I'll try and go through it afterwards. Any help is greatly appreciated. If I missed any questions you think are important to ask, let me know. Ignore any questions if you find them useless, I'd understand I'm taking up unnecesary time."
1721,cscareerquestions,Careers moving in the wrong direction with little skills being gained,"I was hired as a developer for a corporate company two years ago. Hired as a big data developer out of a college software development program. The job is barely passing as 'development' and though I am gaining some skills it does not  feel like any core development skills that can be shown on a resume for a JS job and I feel even less likely to be hired in the field I want to be in. 

I am trying to transition to being a JS developer but all the experience I had in that realm (from school) is now two years in the past. I can update all my JS skills outside of work - but my resume is not going to be picked up in a pile as all my 'development' work experience feels irrelevant to what I actually want to do. 

I am very new to navigating a career and the CS world so I'm a little unclear on what the best approach is. Has anyone else gone through this experience and offer some insight on what the best way to actually move into the career I want to be in?"
1722,cscareerquestions,Extra internship or early graduation,"I'm doing my second internship at the same place. I love working there and I pretty much have a job lined up for when I graduate. If I do a third internship anywhere, it would delay my graduation.

I'm already convinced I want to work for the internship I'm at now, I woild not bother looking for a third internship.

For personal and financial reasons, I'd rather not spend an extra semester and it would make sense to just finish my degree as soon as possible and start working full time. However, I've heard some peers talk about how it would be a bad idea, since doing multiple internships is super important. I don't disagree with that, but I'm not sure if that makes sense for myself?

Internships are taken to have potential full time offees after graduation no? So if I have that lined up, should I just graduate sooner?"

1725,cscareerquestions,"Is going to route of ""Programmer Analyst"" a good idea?","I'm graduating college soon and am trying to figure out what specific field I want to get into. I'll say i'm truly not an ultra competent programmer, I can do my labs and assignments but usually have to get help from my classmates to understand the instructions and give me clues as to where to start and what to do next.

Because i'm probably in the lower half of average in my class, It seems out of reach for me to ever have a title like ""Software developer"" or anything like that. I have a friend who got a job after graduation as an analyst and he says he basically doesn't write code, he just has to read it and communicate with programmers.

Though the pay is obviously still good, it's just not really competitive with actual developer/programmer salaries, he's hoping to reach 90-100k (75kish American) after 4-6 years or so and probably cap off not much higher than that.

Am I being too pessimistic here? Or am I being realistic and this route is probably actually better for me?"
1726,cscareerquestions,Why are Internships Crucial?,"This sounds like a stupid question and it probably is, but why are internships so important in getting hired after undergrad? Most interns get stuck with very basic/menial/repetitive tasks that don't improve their skills much at all. I.e. it seems like the only experience most interns gain is just seeing how company life is. So, why do people talk like not getting an internship means they won't get a job after undergrad?"
1727,cscareerquestions,Early career: joining mid-size startups vs. Big Tech™,"There's a lot of advice for ambitious young people to join mid-size, high-growth startups like ones mentioned in [Breakout List](https://breakoutlist.com/) and [Wealthfront Career Launching Companies](https://blog.wealthfront.com/career-launching-companies-list/) (e.x. from [Marc Andreesen](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part3.html), [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/advice-for-ambitious-19-year-olds), etc.). Idea is to, for example, be an employee at a company like Facebook, before it goes global, in order to maximize learning breadth, with the end goal of apply that knowledge and use those connections to successfully launch own company someday.

Now clearly these people giving advice are involved in the startup world so they have incentive to attract good talent to startups--but they also make compelling points. If my long-term goal is to create a startup to 1) provide something new to the world, and 2) be completely financially independent not only myself but my family, are there any arguments *against* going to one of those companies? Also, is FANG also a viable path to that end goal? (Are people at FANG generally interested in startups or not?)

My current plan is one year at Big FANG, to get that resume ""stamp of approval"", then going to one of those companies. Would love to hear other's thoughts on this."
1728,cscareerquestions,Looking for a way to become a programmer in 2 years (~1000h),"I realized I choose a wrong university degree.

I am already 2 years in uni and won't quit it, but I want to learn programming in the 2 years I have left alongside studies to become a programmer (I will dedicate 2-6h a day for that).I am good at math and I do enjoy programming, I was best in my highscool, made couple bad games with c# that I learned on the way and know some python and c++, even tried craking some stuff in assembly without learning it. I was wondering what I need to learn to be able to land an entry level programming job after studies. I do enjoy game development, but I heard that the job is the worst, so maybe I will head towards making programs, robots or AI. I know that I need to grow my portfolio of projects, so I already have a pretty cool python machine learning project in mind (not sure if it is even possible to make and I have not learned ml yet, I only know basics). I assume knowing language itself is not enough to land a job, so I wanted to ask for directions I should head to make my progress faster, things that companies want programmers to know, what is being taught in universities, any good courses or books, anything that would make my journey faster. Thanks in advanced and sorry if my question was asked already, it would be reassuring to hear from people who already are where I want to be."
1729,cscareerquestions,Looking for entry level CS career path from tech support background,"Hello! I am looking to start hunting for a new job after being at mine for about 6 years. I work at Apple retail as a ""Genius"" which is basically highest tech support in the store below management. But that basically just boils down to entry level tech support with an emphasis on customer support. I'm using a throw away for this because Apple does have a non-discloser agreement.

I have been at my current job for about 6 years, about 2 at my current position. At this point in my life, I am looking for something that can get me a more consistent schedule. Working retail has become a real drain with hours all over the place and no set days off. I would like to find something that furthers my career in CS.

\- I have some college, but no degree. One of my big goals would be having a set schedule so that I can take classes online and finish my degree.

\- I did an internship of sorts at Apple headquarters for 6 months. I want to leverage this during my job search but I am not sure how much it will actually count. I basically worked doing software quality assurance. I created or used test plans to find software bugs and then submitted my findings to the engineers to be investigated and fixed. This involved using automated Python scripts, or even creating my own. I also got some knowledge in cellular standards and testing.

\- I am comfortable enough with programming that I can make things happen if there is an existing framework to work with. But I probably couldn't pass a programming heavy interview.

\- I have an interest and some knowledge in networking.

\- I'm good at learning what I need to know fairly quickly.

\- I am not tied down to a location. So moving anywhere, or even having a job requiring extensive traveling would be fine with me if it also provided me with good work experience.

\- I would be willing to work a job for a couple years that was outside of CS if it also meant I could have a M-F 8-5 situation so that I could actually focus on working on a degree.

\---------------------------

I'm looking for any suggestions on what to do. I want to have found something new in the next 6 months or so. I realize my lack of degree and relevant work experience puts me at a disadvantage but I am not in a position where I can just stop working and go back to school."
1730,cscareerquestions,Going back on an offer," I've accepted an offer to a defense contractor as a software engineer  that required a TS clearence which is expensive and lengthy. Hence, I interviewed and accepted the positions half a year ago despite having another year of school to go. At the time I thought it was the best offer I could get.

Over the past half year I realized I am actually quite good at programming, and after starting my internship this summer (at a startup) I find that the problems my coworkers are having are things I haven't struggled with since freshman year, and I could do so much more. I finish my work in a couple of hours whereas it takes others several days to debug or figure something out. I'm not saying this to brag, I just genuinely never realized my school must have been preparing me at a much higher level (which makes sense as I go to a very good CS school). I just assumed compared to my classmates I was about average, but in the real world, I think I am very far above average. 

I have no problem with the compensation, they are actually paying me quite well for starting. Not Google level salary, but well above average for a starting SWE. I am mostly concerned that I will be the only advanced programmer and having to deal with people who don't know the fundamentals. It really bothers me when I have to remind some of my coworkers right now what a tree is or doubly linked list is. Just the other day, one of my coworkers was tripping up on how to go about making a for loop and my heart just sank. I can't work in an environment like that for long.

Now I don't know anything about defense, but I've heard that you can run into some slackers and the work might not be all that challenging. I do happen to be placed at a very well known company in a very interesting division of the company, but I don't want to deal with coworkers who aren't real programmers. Sorry if that sounds harsh, but I think that's fair. 

Next year, I want to apply and interview for other jobs, perhaps Google, Amazon, etc. (and other non FAANG companies)  just to see if I can get an offer. Thing is, the defense company is paying for my TS clearence and I've already accepted the offer, so I feel like I would be an absolute garabage human being for cancelling if I were to get an offer elsewhere. I'm not even sure I can back out. Also, I doubt I could ever come back if I decided I actually wanted to work there after all, and other comapnies were not the right fit. 

So what should I do? Is it that bad to rescind my acceptance? Should I just stick it out and give it a chance see what happens for a year at the defense job and then transition to switch if it's not for me? 

&amp;#x200B;

Side note: It's not that I don't like the defense company or the work they do. I actually think it's quite cool. I just can't be working on something that isn't above a freshman year coding level with people who struggle to make for loops. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this came off as arrogant. No I don't beleive I am the greatest coder of all time, I realize I have weaknesses and there is a lot I don't know. I just didn't really know where I stood until now."

1740,cscareerquestions,Soft and Hard Skills that people should have for CS Careers?,"I am currently going to college for Computer Science, recently in another class that isn't anything to do with my CS courses, we started a discussion on what soft and hard skills are, and it made me really curious what you guys would recommend not just to myself, but to other people that may find this post as well, are some skills do have.

&amp;#x200B;

**Soft Skills**: These are usually referred to as ""transferrable skills"" because they can be used in more than just computer science. A list of examples would be: 

* Communication
* Flexibility
* Punctual
* Teamwork

Notice how they are on the broadside, showing that they can be used in other fields and careers. They are often still looked for when writing a resume for an employer because the employer wasn't going to train a new hire; as to what we discussed anyways, I know this probably isn't for every employer.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hard Skills**: These are the skills that you have possibly mastered. They are teachable and measurable things, and sometimes you get a degree or certificate for them. A list of examples would be:

* Learning a language (could be a spoken language or a programming language)
* College Degree (Associates, Bachelors, Masters, etc.)
* Operating machines
* Certificates

These are obviously the things that cater towards something specific, like a job or career. They carry a lot of weight to the table because, for example, a college degree shows that you focused on that specific area of learning over others. These are also things that employers can train employees on, both new and veteran, to their company. You should definitely have some of these if you are going for a career.

&amp;#x200B;

(If any of the above is wrong, please let me know to fix it; I am subject to be wrong since I just heard about these being a thing. )

&amp;#x200B;

What would you say are some skills for new people to start thinking about learning or improving within the field in general? What would be some specific kinds of jobs within Computer Science such as machine learning, penetration testing, networking, and so on?  I know that Computer Science is continually changing, that's just the nature of it from my understanding, so are there any that you believe would be possibly useful in the future even?"

1743,cscareerquestions,How to become a programmer. My 2 cents,"Hello, folks!
I will give my 2 cents on how you can become a programmer. 

Disclaimer: This is how I see the world and this is my PERSONAL OPINION. 

1. I see a lot of people trying to become programmers. There are few types of people wanting to become programmers. Some like it because it's ""cool and trendy"", others because it's well ""well paid"" and small group of people like it because they are interested in it genuinely.  No matter which type you are, you must understand that programming is never ending learning process. It's not like some other professions where once you learn it it never changes. To be a good programmer you havr to spend hours learning new stuff EVERY SINGLE DAY, every day you have to read and develop yourself if you want to be good. I know some of you will say: ""I learned X language and Y framework and it's all good i get paid it's fine, you don't have to keep learning "".  Those people don't last long, if you don't progress and learn every day after a year or two you will become useless. Younger people with less years of experience, but more knowledge will replace you. Nobody is going to hire someone who's not progressing, keep that in mind, you have to constantly learn and keep pushing forward. 
  

2. A lot of people wonder if they are good enough to be a programmer. All it takes to be a good programmer is to practice and learn. Only few people have the talent to be a great programmers, however almost anyone can be a decent or a good programmer. What I'm trying to say is, even if you aren't the sharpest tool you can keep up with others or even surpass them, just by practicing more than them. I believe you can become good, if you just push hard enough. 
  

3. Practice and consistency is the key to success. You have to practice every day, even if it's just for half an hour. It's better to practice 7 days a week 30 minutes each day than to spend 8h every sunday. You need consistency and practice in order to understand and remember things. 
  

4. Make sure when you are not getting distracted by anything while studying. Try to spend at least 30 minutes a day focusing only on studying, no phone, no social media, no music, just reading and practicing programming. 30 minutes focused studying is better than 4 hours studying while getting distracted. 
  

5. Don't watch video tutorials. Most of tutorials are just someone following the documentation and making a video. Read and follow the documentation yourself. I know, I know someone will say: ""Yes, but in the video X person Y mentioned something that wasn't in the documentation and it was very useful"". True, there are some useful moments videos, but they are so few its not worth wasting your time with it. Instead of wasting 30-60 minutes watching a video and blindly coping the code from the video, read the doc in 15 min and practice the next 45 minutes. You will learn a lot more just by reading documentation and tinkering around, watch some conference instead of stupid getting started tutorial. 
  

6. Don't switch languages all the time, focus on only one. A lot of people think by learning basic syntax of language X that they know it. Understanding some programming language isn't about the syntax, you can code in Java and switch to PHP in matter of minutes/hours. However that doesn't mean you understand php, it means you know the syntax enough to write few loops and if statements. Understanding a programming language is so much more than knowing the syntax. It takes years of practice to deeply understand a programming language. 
  

7. Read code on github. After grasping the syntax of some programming language, pick a simple problem you want to solve. Write the code, then search for solution online and read up how other people solved the same problem. You will learn a lot by reading other people's code. 
  

8. Don't get discouraged. If you don't understand something instantly don't bash yourself, sometimes it takes a little bit of time to understand. Try getting a rest and continuing on the next day if you get frustrated. Don't give up, failing means you are learning. 
  

9. The most important skill is to know how to Google stuff the right way. What i mean by that is: You should learn to Google your problem in such way, that the solution to be first or second link, not the 5th result or on second page. 
  

10.  First things that you need to do is to decide what you want to code


Web - PHP, Python, Java, C#, Ruby on Rails, Javascript

Embedded and System Programing - C, C++, Rust

Automation - Python, Golang

Command Line Tools - Python, C, Golang, Rust

Games - C#, C++

Desktop Applications - Java, C#

Android - Java, Kotlin.

iOS: - Swift, Objective C.

Front End - Javascript + HTML + CSS 
  
11. The language doesn't matter that much, all languages can do almost anything. Some are just better for mobile apps other for games.

12. DON'T START WITH A FRAMEWORK!!!
 learn the basics I can't stress this enough!!!
Everything is based on same basic things: variables, data types, data structures, loops, conditions, functions. Learn them and you will be able to understand the material further.


 You should aim for is learning the fundamentals... how everything works in programming. 

Imagine you want to teach someone how to multiply 3 by 3. 
You will tell him that 3x3 = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 right?
You bring the multiplication to addition right?
Now imagine, if that person doesn't know how addition works. 
if he doesn't know that 3 + 3 + 3= 9 you won't be able to make him understand how 3x3 works.
You might be able to make him remember that 3*3=9, but he won't know why and how. 
It's the same thing in programming, if you understand the truly basic things you will be able to use and understand any programming language fast.

Same thing learning OOP in programming is based on functions methods in oop are basically functions.

13. Finding a job, here comes the hard part...
One way to find a job is: 
 a. Create Linkedin profile add as many HR and technical people from your country, city as possible.
 b.Create some good looking project on Github, write proper documentation for that project in the repo as well. Documentation is very important it shows that you are responsible person.
 c. Create CV/Resume, put your Github repo inside.
 d. Post on LinkedIn that you are looking for internships, in the post include your resume and your github profile.
 e. people will start contacting you about interviews.

14. When it comes to interviewing those are my 2 cents:

 15. Self esteem and confidence is needed, but don't be cocky, be humble and honest. 
 16. You will always be asked something you can't answer, just ask the interviewer to explain it to you. That way you learn something new for free, also you make good impression as a guy who wants to learn and develop himself further. This boost your chance of getting hired. 
 17. You make new friends, they might not hire you now.but they can help you later you never know. I've been hired by people that rejected me years ago. 
 17. Human interaction itself is pretty good, soft skills are very important important, sometimes even more than the hard skills (coding skills). 
 18. Always ask for a feedback, you will learn what your bad sides are. 
 19. You will learn how much you cost when you get many different offers. 
 20. You will get to know what technologies different companies use and for what reason.

 21. For your first job the best impression you have to make is, that you are able to learn fast and learn from your mistakes. 
 22.  Most internship/junior people are hired  based on intelligence and soft skills, not hard skills (coding skills). 

 22. At my company we can hire you even if you started learning programming 1 week ago as long as you show good potential for development. 
 23. Most juniors out there can't even do enough work to deserve their salary the first year. 
 24. You should show them that you can think the right way, will give you example:

We ask people to find a way to tell me how many leafs are on the tree outside our office. 

The good answers sound like this:

I don't know, but we can get approximate number by counting leafs on a branch. Then counting branches and multiply it by leafs per branch, however not all branches have equal number of leafs, but that way we can get approximate number. This shows that you can come up with some solution and you have the right mindset and enough potential. 


Bad answers sound like this:

I don't know, how can i know they are too many, I can't count them. 
So anyone who doesn't show a good way of thinking and common sense gets rejected. 

 25. Also very important thing is to think out loud. 
 If they ask you question and you stay silent for 2 minutes. 
You are thinking in meantime, but other side just see you silent and think. 'this dude is an idiot he can't even speak is he even thinking about giving an answer'. 

So just think out loud, if you don't know the answer. Say you don't know, but you assume the answer might be....  and here express some of your own logic based on your knowledge about the question.
It's okay to say you never heard of something and you have no idea. After all you are applying for an internship, not a senior position.
 Keep calm and good luck.

1744,cscareerquestions,What universities offer post bachelor degrees (not certificates) in CS?,"After exhaustive research, I decided that going back to school to get another bachelor (1st one in engineering) is better than a boot camp (unless there is a new boot camp I haven't heard of yet.)

1747,cscareerquestions,How to stay motivated on programming?,"Hi everyone,

Around a year ago, I suffered from serious programming burnout. As a result, I was unable to feel joy and pleasure from programming and computer science in general. I decided to abstain from programming ever since.

I'm slowly recovering from the burnout and I'm thinking about getting back to programming again. I am motivated by a desire to build things like a GameBoy emulator, NES emulator, and a compiled programming language.

Unfortunately, the problem is that I have almost no desire to start coding my personal projects. Each time I start, I begin thinking about how much time and effort I need to put into the project and I get demotivated quickly. I am what I used to be. I used to enjoy challenging big projects. But now, I no longer feel this way. It is tedious for me to read documentations and do google searches on my problems.

How can I get motivated to start my projects?"

1750,cscareerquestions,SWE or Research (PhD),"TLDR: Recently accepted to T10 undergrad program in CS, multiple research experience but doesn’t want to be a poor PhD… seeking career advice that doesn’t involve programming 40hr/week but would rather work with people and solve problems/research. Want to prepare for these things now so I have time to actually do something valuable in my undergrad studies. Also want to make good money. 

Recently I have been thinking about my life (too much for sure) and I really don’t know. For the first time I have options and  don‘t want to fuck it up. I will be transferring from a community college to attend a top 10 CS program. 

Based on my background I would be an ideal candidate for a PhD program in something CS (Published peer reviewed paper as a first author). I absolutely loved my undergrad research experience. On top of publishing a paper, I have worked a full time position as an RA at a government funded facility.  

All that being said, being a SWE I can see a future where money is no longer ever going to be an issue. I grew up pretty poor so this is clearly an incentive. However, I hate programming. I love the problem solving aspect of it but sitting in front of a screen for 40hr/week coding away sounds like hell to me. (Also I suck at those leetcode interview questions... If I’m lucky I can get through some of the easy questions)  

I have looked into research positions (FANG + others) but it seems undergrads usually have to be a SWE for a few years before getting to that position. 

Should I focus on research in my undergrad or focus more on those leetcode questions? (Pretty sure with practice I can get better at it) Ideally I would like to do both but realistically I think one or the other will take a pretty good hit (priority is definitely doing well in school). Should I look at other careers like PM or Finance?

I really like working with others and I think most of my success is simply due to my social skills. Professors have complimented me in the past about my communication skills and have told me I should just do a PhD and become a professor. 

Thank you!"
1751,cscareerquestions,Dev Career Paths with best work life balance,"I was wondering, what dev careers offer the best work life balance? 

I have worked in tech as QA for 8 years.  While I enjoy my job overall, I always hated being on call after hours, crunch, and interrupted vacations that have come along with it.  Also, jobs that allow you to train and work on the job, so less personal time is used to stay relevant.

So, what Dev/tech career paths have a good work life balance?  Ones where you are able to completely unplug once you are done for the day and can be done remotely?    Ones where you can learn new skills on the job to stay relevant?

Ones I know have bad work life balance are video game QA, and QA consulting, despite being pretty fun."

1767,cscareerquestions,"I have never asked for a raise, and I don’t think I can switch jobs and get paid this much.","Backstory: 
I have a liberal arts degree, but i took a lot of the data analytics classes for my major, and i took a lot of the entry level programming courses at my university. And I have many personal projects because of FOMO. 

Job:
I was able to land a developer job right out of school and I asked for a cool 45k because i was getting in person interviews but always rejections so i made myself a bargain, mostly because i like to code, solve problems and make stuff. 

They gave me a starting TC of $65. After my first performance review, where i thought i was being fired, they gave me a raise to TC $78k.

After my second, TC of $110k.

My manager and CTO have said i do good work and i mostly think that’s because i’m just faster than all the consultants (bc im full time of course) as getting products or features to testing and deployment. 

Question:
But how much further will this go? Am i in a position to ask for a raise when they have literally doubled my TC in less than two years? I am very bad at reading people’s emotions and sentiment towards me, which is why after my boss talks in a negative tone i feel like i’m about to get fired, but i think they are generally happy with me. 
I really like working there, and i would like to stay at least until my stuff vests but year two is approaching and i feel like it’s up or out here. I don’t think i can pass some hard core leet code questions, seeing how in this interview they asked me “what do you like to do on the weekends” and simple tech questions. 

I’m afraid asking for a raise will hurt, I’m not in Frisco, but housing is expensive and I will have to move out soon but i can only afford to live further away from the office (since were returning later this year most likely) and my current commute is about 1-1.5 hours and after working from home I don’t think i want to make that commute. Even though i only live 15 miles from the office.

TL;DR
I have a liberal arts degree and they have doubled my salary in less than two years. I will need a raise to rent close to the office and not have all my income be directed towards housing. Based on the amount they have increased my salary, i’m not sure it’s appropriate to ask and not sure if i have the credentials to ask for it."

1769,cscareerquestions,I got a new job after a year of searching! Incredible!,"Hey!
So a little history is I've been writing code for about 6.5 years now. Mostly using asp.net and c# as my chosen career. 

As far as my job history goes I've only ever worked for two companies. My first job I was an intern and eventually was hired as a junior. The team was abusive and had a weird power complex situation going on, so I left after 4 years. Plus the company had been dangling the carrot oh money for a while. 

This lead me to my current venture. I'm working for a marketing company and handling five projects that are core operations for the company. I am handling these ony own. I'm the only developer that works on these projects. There are two other devs working in their own projects as well. There isn't a lot of learning or anyone to help guide me career wise, but the culture is phenomenal. Needless to say, I can't grow like I should on my own. 

This lands me on the phone with HR from a new company. I aced the interviews after a year of being told I wasn't good enough for positions, after having interviews with big companies like Microsoft, after being told I'm still junior level and after 6 years that's really bad. I'm taking a position as a lead software engineer with my new company at a 6 figure salary. Under the guidance of a team of 5 engineers as part of a bigger team of 18 engineers. I'm flabbergasted.

In the words of Rocky:

Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain’t all sunshine and rainbows. It’s a very mean and nasty place, and I don’t care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain’t about how hard you hit. It’s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward; how much you can take and keep moving forward. That’s how winning is done! Now, if you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain’t you. You’re better than that!

You can do it you just have to not give up or settle."

1772,cscareerquestions,Mentoring/Onboarding Junior Developers,"Hi, I'm a Software Engineer with a little over 3 years of experience. Even though I do not consider myself a senior yet, I don't think I'm a junior anymore, so probably I'm somewhere close to mid-level.

Basically, I've been at this company for 7 months now working as a Backend Developer, and I gained ownership of some projects pretty quickly. Also some devs who had some ownership left and I pretty much inherited it succesfully. 

Had a performance review recently with the team leader and I was told that they were very happy with my perfomance. Also, I made it clear that my goal at this company is getting to a leadership/senior (or whatever you want to call it) role. My team leader totally understood my willingness to become a senior/team leader, so he told me that he would do as much as possible to help me achieve my goals and become who I want to be.

We've recently hired a new grad and I was offered to mentor him. Of course I accepted since I believe it's a good step towards being a senior developer. So, from the moment this new junior dev joined the team, we made it clear that I was the person he could go to if he had any doubts or problems. 

So, for this time, what I did was to explain him some important and key concepts of our stack, prepared a boilerplate project that uses our technologies so he can mess arround with it, and then he was given access to a course platform that very well explains our stack. We use this course platform because it's pretty good and has had pretty good results training the team in the past. So, he's been taking courses for two weeks now.

Yesterday I was told by my team leader that he was going to hire another junior developer and asked if I wanted to be the mentor as well. I told him that of course. However, with this two weeks experience ""mentoring"" the other junior developer, this time I suggested coming up with some sort of onboarding plan to gain some control on what junior devs are learning through the courses and also to check on their progress. 

With the first junior dev that joined the team, I feel like we've thrown him into this big sea of courses and expect him to do it by himself. Even though he seems to pick up the concepts pretty quickly and seems to understand  the topics, we don't really know if he's actually gaining the proper knowledge and will be able to put what he learns into practice in the near future. So, maybe we want to gain some control over this issue. The team leader agreed that we need some sort of an onboarding process and suggested me to take ownership of this initiative, which I accepted.

So, at this point I find myself thinking about how would I've liked to be onboarded when I first started my career as a developer. Also, by mentoring this junior developer for two weeks, I've already learned a couple of things:

\- Giving a new graw / junior developer access to a course platform doesn't seem enough. You want to take control on what the junior is learning, and figure out if he or she is actually gaining the proper knowledge.

\- By setting up a clear roadmap, the junior dev will have clear goals to achieve and it we be easier for him to understand what we expect from him and where he has to get to.

So, with all this in mind, I have come up with this plan:

\- Because there are 5 courses that we suggest doing, it would be ideal that after every course is completed, we have a small talk on the topics that the course covered, so we can check if proper knowledge was gained and address any doubts and missunderstandings.

\- Set up a safe ""play space"" where the junior dev can put everything he or she learns into practice.

\- Once all of the courses are completed, assign the junior dev a small project he can work with during the following weeks/months to put the courses into practice.

What do you think of this plan? How would've you liked to be onboarded when you landed your first SWE job? Do you have any suggestions that have worked in the past?

Thanks!"

However, due to new travel restrictions, it doesn’t look like I can go back to the US and, based on the conversations I’ve had with my employer, I don’t think the company would be willing to let me work remotely from India.

1779,cscareerquestions,Asking for a demotion from a management position,"Hi,

I've joined a AI research team in a big company (transitioning internally) about a year and a half ago, and got quickly promoted to project leader of a software project that is supposed to help our research team. It makes sense from the team point-of-view because I'm the only person who could have taken that role given my experience (more real SWE experience, and also experienced working in research).

Recently a brainstorming with the research team basically oriented the project toward a data processing project, which again makes sense from the team's point of view. However, for me it's depressing, I've joined the team because I'm truly passionate about ML research (although I don't have a PhD), I haven't touched a DL training for almost a year now, and this new orientation makes me think that I won't for a while.

I'm still young (29y) and even tho I understand that I'm the most qualified for this role, I don't think it's the best way I can expend my career (I'm not THAT technically experienced, most of my decisions are just educated guess and take time plan, I don't have any mentoring, I'm mostly managing interns and juniors).

I also don't think so far that this promotion got converted into title / financial raise (still not senior, even tho I've always been top contributor, and my colleague who stayed in SWE team already got promoted, and because I didn't get promoted my raise last year were imho pretty low).

I'm thinking about asking for a demotion to get back into research (I do think this team is exceptionally good in AI research, so I would prefer not to move).

Is this a suicidal move career-wise? Is there a better solution?

Our raise process is announced in June, I should get promoted senior there (I'm not sure about how much raise), should I wait for it before doing anything?

Any advice would be really appreciated."
1780,cscareerquestions,Which would you choose for studying CS and software engineering in Canada?,"Hi guys, I'm an international student and I'm going to apply for CS/SE program. I am considering

1.Uni of Victoria

2.Uni of Calgary

3.Concordia Uni

4. Uni of Saskatchewan

5.Kwatlan polytechnic university

6.SFU( last choice cuz of its tuition fees)

7.Algoquin College

 However, I can't decide which college is best for me in terms of better educational quality, stronger co-op program, and job prospects. Which of these Uni are most famous for CS/SE and their co-op  locally.  I'm not so sure about Algonquin as I only chose it because it locates in Ottawa, the hub of tech and tuition fees is fair too and i think it would be easy to find tech jobs more easily than other city . But it is not university .However, I like Uvic most as it is near Vancouver( tech hub too) and it ranks around 11 in CS . I'm so confused right now, so I hope that you guys can give me some reviews about these colleges if you happen to have any information. Thank you so much!

P.s: More suggestion for University and recommendation on City study in are more than welcome too as long as tuition fees are not more than 28000CAD"
1781,cscareerquestions,Should I try to negotiate with the 1 offer I currently have if I get any other offers in the near future?,"I have an offer to start next week as a software engineer for a consultant company who have their client, pay is low -&gt; 60k/ year and this is the first offer I got in like 4 months of search after graduation with an Master's, international student here, so finding a company that would sponsor was also a factor. 

Anyways, Now I have other few interviews in the pipeline, starting this Monday, which I might or might not clear. I do have one company, let's call it 'B' where I cleared all rounds(total of 3) and waiting for the decision this coming week, my question is, if the company agrees to extend an offer hopefully, should I mention them about the offer that I have and try to negotiate for a 70k compensation package. 

The average glassdoor review or new grad salary in company B is 67k, a little background about B, I really like the company and the stack that I am gonna work, but they don't provide sponsorship and I am fine with it. I strongly believe I can work there for a few months and find a job that do provide sponsorship within the end of the year. I say this because, I've been constantly applying, for months now and have fair bit of interview experience, and am financially constrained at this point to not have a job. I am not going to stop applying or interviewing in both the cases of these jobs but just wanted to make I'm thinking straight. Appreciate any help or suggestions, thank you."

1789,cscareerquestions,Technical paths/roles for someone interested in security?,"First, I'd like to apologize for posting here and not in /cybersecurity or related. This sub is bigger, and I feel I'll get more advice here than in a more focused sub.

I graduated two years ago, no job applications put out, but I've been trying to force myself to get the hang of web and app development; basically because it's like a foundation for security. I assumed if I want to secure apps, it's best I first know how to build them, but I have no flare for web &amp; mobile app development anymore. It's like I'm forcing myself to do something I'm not interested in. I used to like development a decade ago, but somewhere along the line the passion for it died. I can read code and understand it to an extent and research what I don't, but I don't have that drive to build any sort of web or app-store type mobile app. 

Instead of wasting years on a skill I'm not interested in, I'm thinking of diving into the pool I'm truly interested in; security. To be specific, the technical side of it. I'm interested in pentesting, injections, building and understanding scripts/malwares/ITSec-tools, cryptography (love maths), and bug hunting. 

- What other technical paths/titles can I pursue in the security field? I'm not really interested in the theories of information &amp; cyber security, but I will read up on theories that I need to. But from going through the security subs, I saw majority of the field rarely works with code. They do so mostly to create tools only. 

- Another thing that holds me from going into the general cyber/network security space and kept me trying to master app and web development is freelancing. I'm not really one that enjoys office weekdays 9-5 working. That's more reason why I like penetration testing. I can work from home or as a contractor. So I would like job roles that can allow me freelance or work part time and/or remotely.

Basically, I'm tired of forcing myself to get the hang of web and app development; front end, back end, frameworks, etc. I'm tired of all that - it's annoying just to type and think about. Maybe because of how crowded and diluted the field is, to me. Either way, no desire comes from those topics. I want to transition into something still technical, but not a front-end/back-end based development type job. I loved my cryptography course in school, although hard, it was a challenge I enjoyed. I know I'll love everything technical about cyber &amp; network security. What are my options and paths (especially foundation) please?"

1792,cscareerquestions,"Got my first Junior Software dev job, and I hate it here. HELP!","At 30 years old, I recently made the switch to a career in tech. Completed a bootcamp and landed my first junior software dev role a month ago, during my interview I asked about onboarding and training, I was told there would be training.

I got hired at a small start up with a dev team consisting of 3 other people: 1 software architect and 2 other junior devs. The company’s goal is to build a complex social media platform from scratch within 4 months. This first job has been absolute hell. 

My onboarding process was to code a calculator in 4 days using a language and library I have never used before. My code for the calculator was never reviewed lol but the software architect believes that was enough training to now build strong working features for this platform. The problem is the SA has created a toxic environment where questions are answered with sarcasm and condescending tones. There is no structure, no documentation, the SA has no interest and no time to mentor me or spend time going over expectations. The SA is building the platform how he wants so all the code structure lives in his head and he doesn’t particularly care to take time and explain anything to us. I understand he’s in a shitty position where he has to build this huge platform singlehandedly with 3 Junior devs who don’t know what they’re doing.

He’s been in the industry for 20 years and somehow expects us Junior devs to be able to pick up on his code quickly and churn out tickets in these sprints. Some of the tickets are beyond my scope of knowledge or skill. Whenever we have company meetings he always says “I encourage my devs to ask questions” and when I do ask questions it’s met with hostility and impatience, and some rude comments about how annoying I am.

He spends a lot of time trolling me or the 2 other Junior devs when we take long to complete a ticket or he straight up tries to humiliate me and other juniors during our dev meetings if we make mistakes. He has literally given me an eye roll emoji as feedback. If I try and stand up for myself and explain I am new and still learning, it makes him troll even harder. I don’t feel I am being given the grace to be a Junior dev and to make mistakes without fear of consequence and to learn in a safe environment. I feel like I’m being set up for failure rather than success. I am not looking to be spoon-fed or have my hand held but this has been 4 weeks of insanity. I’m tired of feeling like an incompetent dev, because of the lack of support and structure.

I don’t have a HR department and this is really taking a toll on my mental health. I am stressed all of the time, my anxiety is at an all time high, I can’t ask for help without fear of being judged and ridiculed. I am constantly made to feel stupid. After speaking with peers I realize this is not a normal experience for a Junior dev. I’m trying to stick it out so it doesn’t look bad on my resume but I don’t think I can last much longer in this demoralizing environment. 

 I don’t know if this is a “grass is greener on the other side” moment. Any advice is welcome and appreciated. Sorry for the long rant. 

TLDR: I’m a junior dev working at a start up with one senior architect who has no interest in explaining anything. I’m lost, stressed and defeated."
1793,cscareerquestions,Two offers: Small company (higher salary) vs large Company (job security)?,"I've been given two job opportunites as a new grad (mature student). I'm not sure how I should approach this as this would be my first ""real,"" job and I want to make sure I don't rush into this.

Job A (Small company) = offered an opportunity to work on a new product line so it would be like a startup environment wearing multiple hats and taking on this project will allow me to make a larger impact in the organization. The salary is $10k more than Job B, but has no benefits (health).

Job B (large company) = offered a junior position working alongside engineers, learning industry standards, good benefits (health), better job security, and is a reputable company to put on my resume. However, the salary is lower (-$10k) and I get to work on fewer responsibilities compared to Job A.

1796,cscareerquestions,Need advice! :( MLE vs. SWE vs. PM,"TLDR; Currently an applied scientist in NLP, but I suck at math and do not enjoy research, but I do enjoy writing and public speaking. Looking for suggestions on whether to take my career path towards MLE vs SWE vs PM

Hi! To provide some context, I'm currently an NLP applied scientist. I chose this job because I wanted to get into ML -- however, working with almost all PhDs my imposter syndrome is going through the roof. Also, I've never been very strong in math, I somehow got through college and my masters taking no math classes lol, but my current job assumes a strong basis in linear algebra. I am working in research but I don't like it -- I find it difficult to write papers and come up with new solutions to existing problems. 

Why MLE: I think ML problems are super interesting, but my current AS role is very research focused.  I want to move out of this to hopefully something further away and closer to prod (i.e. what I think is the MLE role). Would my lack of math background be my Achille's heel here as well?

Why SWE: I did pass HC at Google for SWE a year ago when I was fresh out of college (though I chose to go to Amazon b/c of the opportunities in ML) and made it into some other companies, so I think that my interviewing skills for SWE are not too bad. If I will have imposter syndrome forever as long as I'm in ML, going to SWE may not be a bad idea. Another plus is that I enjoy coding.

Why PM: Honestly not too sure of what the day-to-day of a PM looks like. However, I've actually grew up interested in humanities since I was a child until the middle of college (was always an aspiring writer/journalist), so I think that public speaking and writing are some of my bigger strengths I have that I am unable to use as an engineer. Though I enjoy it, I do not necessarily think coding needs to be part of my job (though I do want to stay in tech) and I think that my past experience in ML and my strengths in writing/speaking may be a plus.

Any help would be appreciated!"

1809,cscareerquestions,Dealing with the imbecility of consulting companies/agencies,"I have recently relocated to Belgium via a consulting company (they sponsored my working permit), and I'm feeling stuck because I found out that the whole thing is meme.  
as a developer with +3 years of experience, I feel like the only 'serious' way to build a career, make real money and feel like really doing something is to either become a freelance/independent software developer, or simply look for a company (preferably a company that builds ans sells software) that we find interesting, try to get hired by them and stick there for few years.  


I can list many reasons why working for consulting company feels like a joke. 

* While looking for a client, I had to deal many and many times with very low IQ Hr people working for the supplier (= direct contact with the client) that had no idea what they're doing or what they're talking about, and I had to act cool and prove to them that I'm a good dog so that they forward my CV to the client. 
* My employer lies about my experience and sends a fake CV with more years of experience, so that he gets a better rate.
* Most of the clients are proposing opportunities using technologies from the dark ages. And it seems like they outsource these roles because it's impossible for them to find someone to agree to get hired as an internal employee, and work on such projects.
* While working for the client, there's a constant feeling of 'detachment', they expect the external developer to be involved with the team and project, but the truth is that he's merely a tourist there, and he can be laid off in 24 hours for reasons like budget issues or team organization. 
* Indian consulting companies keep taking the rates down, which makes it very hard to negotiate a decent salary raise in the future.   


This is my first time working for a consulting company, because in the past I worked only for companies that build and sell software(as internal developer). So I'm wondering if  it's the case everywhere in Europe when it comes consulting company , or I have to do a better research before accepting a job?"
1810,cscareerquestions,Can/should I get a data science job before I finish my PhD?,"Just some background info about myself before I get to my main dilemma. My BSc was in Molecular &amp; Cellular Biology and my MSc/MRes was in Biological Sciences (where I specialized in Genomic Data Science/Bioinformatics). R programming was central to my Master’s thesis topic, where I applied generalized (and phylogenetic) linear models (GLMs) and multiple regression analyses to test various evolutionary hypotheses. Both my BSc and MSc/MRes were from Russell Group universities (i.e. the UK equivalent of Ivy League institutions). It was during my Master’s when I fell in love with data science, and became fascinated by how big data can be used to address the major socioeconomic and environmental problems of our time. I recognized my calling, and decided that I wanted to become a data scientist. 

However, I was offered a PhD in a really interesting topic (phylogenomics/bioinformatics/genome mining) before COVID kicked in; and I decided to accept it in April due to all the employment uncertainty that was in the air during this time period - my initial plan was to get an entry-level data science position. My current goal is to look for a data science position once I finish my PhD (in Germany, where I’m doing my PhD, you have three years to do a PhD, and I’m currently six months in). However, I have recently encountered a lot of difficulties in my PhD. Most importantly, my supervisor has moved to another institution and I’m basically “left to my own devices” and unsupervised at my institution. These events have made me question whether or not it is worth staying on for another 2.5 years. In spite of these recent events, I’m still determined (more so than ever) to obtain a data science position once I finish my studies. My dilemma, however, is *when* I should start looking. Would it be best to wait until I finish my PhD before I look for a position, or can I start looking now and then quit my PhD if I find something? As I said previously, I’m an R-ficiando (and am very familiar with advanced techniques in ML etc.) and am also learning Python on the side. 

Any advice on this issue (i.e. whether you need a PhD for a data science position if you come from a non-CS/-maths/-physical science background) would be much appreciated!"

My approach:

1, I believe the smartest thing to do right now is to get a TN by becoming a Canadian Citizen.  AFAIk, you only do TN for as long as you can’t get H1B. Good thing is TN can be extended “indefinitely” in 3-year increments, so as a Canadian, you can still work there as long as it takes to get H1B.  I  think you can work forever in the U.S with a  TN and all you have to do is re-apply every 3 years.

2. Apply for H1B while working as a TN, I think I'm stuck with one employer with H1B and I might not be able to switch jobs during the time period.

3. Get Green card because of H1B

1814,cscareerquestions,Are internships during college worth pursuing?,"Hello. This is a question/rant at myself.

I have 3 semesters left (including this one) before graduating. Since college started, I've been trying to land an internship. I spread myself too thin trying to learn a lot of skills needed by the internships I find. I finally managed to interview once and I passed a technical interview but I sucked at the ""management"" interview (the one where they ask you behavioural questions) so I was rejected (they didn't tell me the reason, I just assumed that it's the management interview because it came after the technical one).

It's frustrating. Every internship requires a different set of skills (at least the ones in my country) and I always feel like my skills and projects aren't enough. Right now, my resume has many skills but I'm not really good in most of them, if I had to use them I will need to review and learn more about them.

Meanwhile, I sort of neglected studying college subjects, telling myself I'll learn them later, but I now regret it. Maybe if I focused on studying the core CS subjects and did a decent project in each of them, I would have more opportunities when I graduate (e.g., be ready to do a master's).

But I'm still not sure if I should focus the time I have left solely on that or if I should still try to pursue internships. I think initially my desire to find an internship was a dumb one. I think it was along the lines of ""I want to be like Mark Zuckerberg"" or something. I thought I was special just because I started programming at 10 but boy was I wrong. Because of my humongous ego, I made a lot of bad decisions. I kept comparing myself to my colleagues who started interning or freelancing, one of them even worked as a full-fledged SWE in multiple companies!

Another reason of why I was rushing things so much is because of my anxiety that my chances of finding a job after I graduate will be very low without an internship. A lot of the companies I've seen are either looking for interns or senior devs.

So right now, I'm confused. I want to know if my fear is justified and if there's a rational reason people pursue internships during college. Right now, the only thing I can think of is money and experience. I need both but more importantly I need knowledge. I don't want to call myself an engineer if I don't have good grasp on these topics (I'm talking about OS, databases, distributed systems, even compilers).

**TL;DR** I wasted a lot of time trying to land an internship but never did. Now I have 2.5 semesters left and I want to know if there's a merit in pursuing an internship or if I should just focus on college."

1818,cscareerquestions,What do people at classical SDE roles do?,"I’ve been working on an automated testing role for almost 2 years straight out of college at a fortune 100 company. I mainly work on junit for my testing. I don’t really enjoy my job but haven’t looked for other opportunities due to Covid crisis abs because my pay is pretty high. But now I think it’s very important for my career to move to a development role so as to not be pigeonholed as a QA guy(absolutely no offense to QA engineers). 

But the bummer is, I really don’t know what people with SDE titles do to even look for those kinds of jobs. I’ve been working on my problem solving skills through leetcode and I’m confident that I can get the grasp of it because it’s mostly logical. But I have no idea what other skills I need to learn for development related questions or what kind of projects I should start working on. The product that I work on is a cloud application with microservices that uses java and follows CI/CD practices and I find its concept pretty interesting 

Can anyone please outline what kinds of stacks/frameworks classical SDEs at big companies use or work on so I can get familiar with them. Please excuse me if my post seems dumb. I’m really worried about my next step so I’d be extremely grateful if someone suggests me a direction."

1820,cscareerquestions,Backing on out on internship 2 weeks before it starts?,"Hi,

Alright so I know this title probably provokes some pretty strong reactions, but hear me out for a minute. Here's the story:

&amp;#x200B;

After going through a series of interview back in Fall 2020, I was offered a Summer 2021 software engineering internship at a decent company (not one of the ""top three"" or whatever y'all on this sub call it, but a pretty big company that would have been a decently paid internship).

Alright great, throughout winter etc. I sign all my forms, get my drug tests yada yada and everything is good to go.

Cut to March -- I get an email from a company that is more well known/tech centered, for a position that is also software engineering, but a lot more focused on what I enjoy and better paid. 

I just got an offer from company #2 and I want to accept it but this would mean backing out on company #1's internship which is supposed to start in like 2 weeks.

I get this would probably blacklist me at company #1, but like based on the contract they gave me, either party can terminate at any time for no reason. Is there any reason I shouldn't do this?

thanks"

1822,cscareerquestions,Reasonable coding assessment for a Junior Full Stack position?,"Hi! I'm a new grad currently seeking my first tech role. I was contacted by a recruiting agency on LinkedIn. I had an introductory interview with the agency's hiring manager for 15 min where she asked the basic interview questions (my background, skills, etc.) Then she gave me this assessment to hand in within 24 hours. 

Frontend: You will use ReactJS and Mapbox to build a simple web app that displays routes on a map. 
1. The user should be able to place markers on the map. How you do this is open-ended. For  example, you could display a marker at the center of the map and allow the user to move the  map around it (Uber-style) or you could allow the user to drag a marker onto the map (Google  Maps-style). 
2. The user should be able to place up to two markers on the map. When the user places the  second marker, a straight line should appear between them. 
3. The user should be able to clear the markers on the map. 
Bonus: Instead of a straight line, draw the walking route from the first marker to the second  marker. 

Backend: You will use Node.js and MySQL to create a simple API that communicates with the web app you built. 
1. The user should be able to save the position of their markers along with a unique title. 
2. The user should be able to browse a list of all saved titles. 
Bonus: The user should be able to select a title from the list, which displays the corresponding  marker positions on the map. 

I've been coding for 2 years and I actually suck at it. I barely slept trying to finish this and it's still incomplete. I read other posts saying not to put in more than 1-3 hours for an assessment but, again, I'm new and I can always add the project to my portfolio so I really don't mind spending more time on it. But is this a reasonable assessment to give to a jr hire to finish in a day or am I just stupid?

1824,cscareerquestions,How long do you all plan to be in tech?,"Everyone says there’s ageism in this industry. This post isn’t here to argue whether or not that’s true. Rather, to see what everyone’s plans are IF this is in fact true. Let’s say you get your first developer job at 24. According to ageism theory, by the time you are around 40 it’s very hard to find a new job as a developer. 

A lot of the time people say they want to move into management or start their own business. But we can’t all go that route. There’s only so many manager positions and the success rate of new businesses is pretty low. 

So if neither of those are options, what do you realistically plan to do until you are around 60-65 if it is in fact hard to find a job around 40?"
1825,cscareerquestions,Is not having a CS Major a deal breaker? For machine learning specifically. I require guidance for a tough decison that will heavily affect my life.,"I need to make a tough decison and it's devouring my soul faster the longer I ignore it.

I am a 20 year old guy from Turkey and last year I quit studying German Translation and Interpreting, it was my third year studying it. I quit because it was far away from my dreams and I have never been interested in any degree other than STEM degrees. 
So I quit and started studying. I got medicated for my ADHD, learnt how to be disciplined for the first time in my life. I dreamt every day and worked hard for it but the exam is approaching, only 55 days left and I still can't score high enough to study CS at a decent school.

I have studied so hard and went from being extraordinarily bad at maths to decent. Yet time wasn't enough to do good enough it seems.

I will enter three exams: one is a general exam, other two are special exams for Language and Science/Maths. 

Now I have two choices:

I will either risk everything and keep pushing for a CS degree, I already study 8 hours a day and I will make it 10-12 for the remaining time I have until the exam. If I fail though, this means that I will have wasted a lot of time on science/maths exam which means that I will do much worse on the general exam and language exam.

Or I will accept the failure and throw my dreams into a trash bin, get realistic and study for the language and general exams so I can go to at least study one of the best language degrees in Turkey and study programming by myself and try to fill my portfolio during my language degree study. 

I realize this is a lot of stuff to read and it may be incoherent, I am sorry for that. I am really stressed and I need guidance. 

Is not having a major at CS a deal breaker? I am not interested in web stuff. My dream is to work in the AI side of things, Machine Learning and alike. I want to work in companies like Neuralink and other companies that mainly work on research side of things. 

I studied programming myself for about 1.5 years as I studied my German degree. I quit studying programming to work full time for the exams. So I am not clueless about programming and I love coding. I love technology, electronics and science but not some damn translation degree that will be irrelevant in 10 years as the technology advances.

Thank you for your time, I can provide any details needed if I forgot about some."

1828,cscareerquestions,How much coding knowledge required as an engineering manager.,"Hi all,

I have been working as a developer for over 15years in the UK, but for last 4 years I have been promoted to manage a team of about 15 people and gradually, due to all managerial tasks I stopped coding all together, so for the last 2 years I have not been coding at all, I am quite active outside work in terms of reading about new tech, trying to keep up with the changes but I will never be able to keep up with devs who are doing it day to day. 

Recently we have been moving some legacy backend stuff to .net core and using react for frontend stuff and there are brilliant devs &amp; architects in my team, now it feels odd that I am managing them but I lack the knowledge about these new tech, obviously I still have experience in terms of the general architecture and give guidance to the team but most of the time I let architects decide about the technical details. 

Deep down I am worried that if I wanted to go back and try to get a job as a developer it would be difficult for me to pass the technical interview, then I would look for a managerial position but looking at some of the job posts I see in lots of the managerial job posts they expect you to be hands on and still code! Where does that leave me then? Anyone in similar position? What’s tour take on this?

I just completed my sophomore year and realized two things I didn’t really know before: 1) I really like CS and that 2) I actually have the ability to do it. I wish I could’ve seen this sooner (i.e. before I was halfway done with college), but I’m really close to pulling the trigger on switching to a CS degree. 

The one thing that really worries me is I know how competitive internships can be, as many of my friends in CS have SWE internships as sophomores. I’d be afraid of switching majors now and then having no real experience with which to nab an internship after junior year. I know that FAANG is probably out of the question and that’s okay, I just don’t want to be completely left out in the cold. 

Does anyone have experience with doing something similar, or do you think it’s too late to switch?"

I realised I am not cut out to be an academic (I wanted to use the PhD scholarship to get it and then leave for academia). So I just stayed and have made good money in the past 2 years (doing quant programmer stuff).  
I have been thinking about future moves and it seems to me that a lot of Comp Sci jobs, especially in software dev, involve maintaining, isolated small features improvements and outright boring config changes.  
Software is great when it is greenfield and you have to design everything, pick tools and be creative, but real life has not been like that for me. All of my mates who got into FAANG and stayed tell me the same perspective.

1833,cscareerquestions,Internships a good place to start for a self-taught dev?,"Hey folks.

I recently considered applying for a few internships to get my foot in the door. I've been on and off teaching myself Python for almost 2 years now, and I think the next logical step in my growth is to be thrown to the wolves in a professional environment.

I recently spoke to a Data Engineer about applying for the Data Engineer internship role underneath him. He mentioned that although my skills may fit the role, his company is only looking for college students. I am willing to work unpaid in order to gain valuable experience, however. 

To no longer digress, I wanted to ask, is it worth it applying to internships, when most companies hiring interns are only really considering college students? I never understood the logic. I don't need credit obviously, just experience and am willing to look for free. Should I just try to dive into a junior role at this point?

I currently like in a very low cost of living city. I make $70k/yr and can afford a nice downtown apartment and to put 25% of my income towards retirement. 

I am currently interviewing with 2 companies - both remote positions. One in the bay area and one in NYC. Glassdoor and Levels seem to indicate they pay this position around 130k-160k. I am on parts 7 and 6 of their interviews respectively so I'm expecting salary negotiations to come up soon.

I've recently been made team lead of a team of about 8 people. I'm completely new to managing a team and I've found the switch from developer to team lead quite challenging in many areas I didn't expect.

One challenge I did expect and was concerned about is that I have a developer on my team who is a better developer than I am. He's a very smart guy and he does a lot of study of software development in his own time as well as in work. This results in him coming to me with questions I don't really know the answer to, or sometimes pointing out a mistake I've made or something I haven't considered. I'm always glad when he does catch mistakes or omissions but it makes me feel like I'm not up to the job of team lead as the team leads I've worked with in the past have usually been the best in the team at development.

Thanks for coming onto this post.  
I am deciding between ***UBC and TU Delft*** for bachelors in CS.

  
I have gathered that more work experience/skills = better chances to get into FAANG = higher pay!

So, during the 5-year bachelors at UBC, I will get **2 years of internships/co-op**.   
and during the 3-year bachelors at TU Delft, I will get an **OOP project and a software project with a company.**   
Therefore people at TU Delft tend to do Masters which is another 2 years and then make about *5000 €/month* pre-tax at FAANG.  
while due to work experience UBC people go onto make *10k USD* in Seattle and also make *9k CAD* during internships at FAANG!  


1. Is the job market better near Vancouver/Seattle (in UBC) as compared to Europe?  
I have heard the tech sector is stronger in North America.
2. During the bachelors, as I am learning the same things with less work experience in Delft can I land a job in Vancouver/USA FAANG or do I need to undertake a postgraduate study in the USA?

So since I've also been passionate about philosophy since middle school like programming, I decided to just double major in philosophy and business at my chosen college.

Here's my question. I still really like programming, and I would really like to pursue a career in the area after college, or even during it.

I joined the latest company 3 months ago (which is a top UK startup) after 3 stages of interviews, getting a decent salary (about 15x of the average national income, I'm from 3rd world). 

I feel there is something wrong, as most of the team has exceptional academics and many years of experience, and I don't have even a CS diploma. 

Should I talk to my manager about this issue/insecurity?"

I started at this new firm about a month and half ago, and just started to get comfortable (knowing the tech stack, meeting the team, settling in etc.)

The good thing is the company I’m at is a large Fortune 500 company that invests in its employees and doesn’t have any hierarchies. You can become a senior or software architect but you won’t be like above anyone. This gives me a little extra boost.

But my question is, how do I become a software architect? Like how good do I have to be? What are the general requirements? How much more experience do I need? Etc.

I know my job will be very stressful and challenging, but I wouldn’t be a software engineer if I didn’t already know this.

A negative review mentioned leadership asking employees to write positive reviews.

It seems most negative reviews come from a different, non-engineering side of the company, and mainly are centered around poor management and high turnover for speaking out. All engineering reviews are 5 stars, though I guess those could be astroturfed as well.

I wrote a paper in it and have worked on several major projects based on these fields. I am also interning as a Machine Learning researcher at a decently reputed college in my country.

While talking to my research advisor, he brought up what I planned to do in the future and for me, it was to get a master's degree in machine learning or a relevant field. But he suggested I should also look into other fields as in 5 to 10 years this field might not exist. Previously I thought it was one of the fastest growing fields in the world and it's what I heard almost every day from everyone. I also looked up these concerns online and there's nothing concrete on whether it's actually dying or not. Some say it highly depends on the skill level which is obviously true, and some say it is crazy to think of it dying so soon.

Should I look into something else for my master's so as not to end up jobless in 10 years? Or was he just giving me ill-informed advice? I'm at real crossroads here as I wouldn't have much time to prepare on an entirely new field after this sem."

Mostly because it provides great co-op opportunities and despite being in Canada, has considerable standing with US companies. 

Ultimately, I would like to pursue a job in SWE and work in America, even if for a few years, but I was wondering, how feasible is this for a math major? I do have some other universities I could go to for CS including Western, McMaster (well, not yet) and Guelph but do you think it'd be better to just go to Waterloo math because of the reputation/co-op program? By the way, acceptances for this school won't come out till May, but I'm just preparing myself to make the best option if my situation is not ideal."
1877,cscareerquestions,Which is better after graduation - AI research engineer internship or digital graduate scheme??,"Hi everyone! First time poster here (from the UK) looking for some advice from those with more experience!

As the post title says, I'm currently trying to choose between a full time, year long internship in AI research, or a graduate role at a tech consultancy. From where I see it, both come with their pros and cons

A bit about myself - I'm currently completing a conversion masters in computer science at a good UK uni, and before that I did geophysics as my undergrad. Have had a hard time deciding what to do with my life, having dropped out of the first course I started studying at uni. This comp Sci masters is the first time I've finally felt like I'm doing something that I really enjoy, I was inspired to get into it after a doing some online courses in Machine learning during my undergrad. I'm also quite keen to work in healthcare/ai if possible. I'll be graduating in September and both the roles I'm trying to choose between will start immediately after I graduate. 

AI research internship pros:
- Well known company - would look good on cv?
- NLP based project
- reason I got into computer science was to learn more about AI, this would definitely help with that!
- it seems that a lot of roles in AI/ML require a PhD, so I feel nervous to pass up an opportunity to work on an AI project with a large company when i can't currently afford to do a PhD 

AI research internship cons:
- offices in the middle of nowhere so I'd have to relocate to a village where I don't know anyone
- salary is not great as its an internship
- job ends after 12 months

Tech consultancy grad scheme pros:
- good pay
- Central London offices
- been offered a role in health care and life sciences department so there will be a good range of interesting projects
- rotational schemes in cloud, cyber and software dev so I'd learn a lot

Tech consultancy grad scheme cons:
- company reputation not as good
- not sure it would look as good on my cv as the company isn't as well known and isn't a major tech company
- graduate scheme so will likely be asked to do a lot of the ground work for senior consultants which could be boring?
- not much potential to learn about AI/ML


My main question is, if you were me which would you take? Which role would provide better prospects for me in the future? I've only been doing cs for less than a year so I know I need a lot more experience, but I would absolutely love to work for a health care or med tech company like deep mind at some point in the distant future, so any advice would be much appreciated!"

1879,cscareerquestions,Referring friends or acquaintances makes me really uncomfortable. Is this normal?,"I don't know what it is. I don't have one year of experience yet and I have had many people ask me to refer them to my company. I have imposter syndrome for sure and I feel very insecure about my job right now. I have a best friend I would die for. Of course, if she asked me to refer her, I would totally do it no questions ask. Leaving her, I have many close friends but if they ask me, I get very uncomfortable and go to the normal answer of ""We don't have any positions as if right now that you could fill."" I don't know if this is an insecurity with me or if it has to do with bad experiences in college when I teamed up with friends and ended up losing them.

Is this feeling normal? Not wanting to work with friends? Not wanting to have personal and work life mixed up? I have the power to refer someone but I choose not to. Does that make me a selfish human being? 

Any advice on this topic is greatly appreciated."
1880,cscareerquestions,I just started at a new company and it's not the right fit,"I recently left a startup that I was at for 5 years to join a new company. There were a lot of politics and no where left for me to grow at the old company, so I know that leaving was the right choice, and I don't regret it. However, I feel that I may have jumped too quickly at an opportunity that seemed good from the outside due to the title, compensation, etc.

The problems I have with the new role:

\- First time founders that are non-technical and don't want to do anything but build as many features as possible. I was careful about this in the interview process, but apparently not careful enough.

\- A horrible codebase (seriously, it's awful), which in and of itself is fine, but see above - they don't want to commit any resources to fixing it

\- They want me to hire new engineers, but I wouldn't wish working here on anyone I know due to the above.

\- I can't make myself feel any passion for what we're doing here

Aside from that, the people are very friendly, there are basically no politics, and the business model seems to be working quite well.

&amp;#x200B;

Ultimately I really want to be my own boss, but that isn't in the cards in the short-term unless I can suddenly get a bunch of contracting work.

1881,cscareerquestions,Delay graduation to search for internships,"I'm a cs major who's entering their senior year after switching majors from electrical engineering. Because of the switch I don't have any internships in software development. I have two internships that are related to electrical engineering, however, and I work as both an undergraduate teaching assistant and do research as well. I have a number of projects listed on my resume (a portfolio website I built with react and a few other websites built with a MERN stack)

I've been applying to internships with little success and I can't help the nagging feeling that the lack of attention is due to my lack of industry experience. 

Since I'm entering my senior year I figure it's time to start searching for full time positions, but I worry that I just won't receive any call backs without internship experience in software development. I've got a high GPA (3.9), but from what I've heard most companies don't really care (and neither do I, I just list it because it is high)   


My question is this -- should I delay graduation to have more opportunities to visit job fairs and find an internship, or just throw out as many full-time applications as I can during my senior year?"

While dev ops stuff isn't my passion, one the one hand, I feel like at least a year doing it would be invaluable experience. On the other, my true love is still in application and backend development, so I'm really torn on what to do.

1885,cscareerquestions,Are there support/automation type roles?,"I like using my technical skills to automate things to speed up work. I did this at a (non-technical) part time job I used to work for in college and had a good time. It wasn’t my main job, but it helped me and my coworkers have easier days and I learned a lot.

Since graduating over a year ago I’ve been working as a software developer working on big full fledged applications. I don’t think I like it (for various reasons that don’t matter to the question I want to ask)

Question: Are there support type roles out there where I can just write scripts to automate things? Or jobs where programming is an asset but not necessarily the whole job?

I’m kind of miserable where I’m at and just doing some research right now for specific titles to look up. I’ll take a pay cut if it means I’m happier. I just need health insurance lol

Any tips, resources, or experiences would be much appreciated!

1886,cscareerquestions,Capital One Internship - Richmond vs Plano,"I recently got an offer to intern at Capital One over the summer, and I've been given the choice of either picking the Richmond or Plano office. Since everything will be remote over the summer, I wouldn't actually be going to any of the offices over the summer, but if I were to get a full-time job offer after the internship, I believe I would be working in whichever of the two offices I choose (unless I can manage to transfer to a different office).

Has anybody here worked at any of these offices, or does anybody have any thoughts as to which one would be the better office/location to choose?

I never had friends, I never had any of the experience a 33 year old, or even a 23 year old in UK has.

1891,cscareerquestions,I've been in the field for 8 years. I have no specialty and feel like a loser.,"I started my career in support then I got a job in an AI company. Now I am working as a backend web developer and when I talk to other developers, I cannot relate to some of the things they talk about. I always receive kudos from the people I work with including some really good senior engineers but some of the things they talk about sound alien to me. I can never speak on the same level of confidence that they do. I struggle the most with terms because my brain just throws them out as soon as I stop working on anything that requires the knowledge.

One incident was this guy asking me if Go has generics and I asked him back what ""generics"" even mean. The same is true for words like singletons, SOLID principles, etc. I get the idea but I never remember the words and I always end up looking dumb when talking to others. It feels like a surprise memorization quiz. It may be easy for most people to know those terms but I struggle remembering them a lot. This is one of the reasons I've kept myself from attending other job interviews.

I also find myself struggling when it comes to basic things like structuring my projects. I can write code and make it work, organize it a little bit, but I never seem to reach the level of the other developers around me who just seem to be in a flow.

What can I do to improve this? Does it make sense to carry around a note that I review every few days just to remember certain terms?"

He says the reason for the contract to hire is not a try before you buy, but has something to do with budget reasons.

There is a point soon where I can specialize in one direction or another and I'm not sure which way I want to go yet. I have a syndrome of ""I kind of like it all"" right now, as it's all pretty interesting. But, when I look to the future I don't know where I want to take this: game dev, web dev, fin-tech, os dev, browser dev, I mean the list just goes on and on.

I honestly would just love to hear from fellow programmers who are employed or have been employed about what jobs your doing and what it looks like? Or roughly what your journey looked like from sort of the ""beginner/learner phase"" to actually applying it and having a job?"

1903,cscareerquestions,Laid off after 6 months of being promoted to a Senior Associate and I only have about 2.5 years of Experience.,"Hello all,

I recently started working as a SecOps, jack of all trades programmer for a cloud compliance team at a large financial GSE. My entire team of 8 was unexpectedly laid off a few weeks ago, my supervisor and manager had no idea it was coming and were also laid off.

When I was hired for the job, I was given the position as a Senior Associate, usually they require at least 3-5 years of experience for this title, I only had 2 years of experience at the time. The recruiter said they made an exception for me because the manager liked me.

I have two questions:

1) How do I bring this up to potential employers? Currently I have been honest and told them that the entire team was laid off because of ""reorganization"", that's what I was told in my exit interview. I feel as though they might think I am lying and I don't want it to seem like I got axed because I was promoted too quickly.

2) Should I still be looking for ""Senior"" level positions, 3+ years of experience minimum? Would another company value the title I had or does it vary too much from company to company for them to put any weight behind it.

Thank you in advanced!"

&amp;#x200B;

Long story short, I was due to graduate in May with a BS in Computer Science. But our senior design project fell through, and the professor let us know that we were going to fail, meaning I wouldn't graduate this semester. I spoke with my advisor to explore different options, and she told me that I have completed all of the coursework to still graduate this May with a BA in Computer Science instead.  She said I could drop the other 4 computer science classes I was taking alongside Senior Design as they weren't needed for the BA. So I ended up dropping them, so my parent's could get their money back before the drop deadline, as I make a decision. My question is, should I just graduate this May with a BA or should I do the extra year for a BS? If I go for the BS, I would have to do a year long senior design, and 4 computer science classes over the course of a year so 6 classes total. I have about 2 years of programming internship experience, and I'm typing this from my internship right now (I'm hoping they extend me to fulltime, but there's be no promises). I've been job searching, with my resume saying that I'm due for a May graduation, but things seem but I have not heard much back. Feeling a little demoralized, but I just want to make the correct decision for my future.

1908,cscareerquestions,Transferring to a better school or finishing at state school,"So I am currently in my second year at a local college in my hometown. I am a computer science major with a minor in data analytics and have been thinking about options elsewhere. It's not that I don't like my current learning environment, but the fact that the program definitely isn't comparable to larger, more well known programs. I have started the application process to several other schools but before I make a final decision I would like to obtain as much information as possible on the pros and cons of staying or leaving. I am aware the largest difference would probably be cost, as I am currently not taking out any loans and still living at home while keeping a job to save as much as possible. 

I guess the main question I have is would it be worth it for me to transfer to a better program that has more recognition and pay considerably more or would it be more worth it to finish out at my current school and develop a strong portfolio (whether through school or independently) that would still look attractive to employers?"
1909,cscareerquestions,Started my first Dev role 2 months ago for an underpaid salary. This morning I was offered a 40% salary increase with another company. I’m conflicted and don’t know what to do.,"Title has it all. 

I received my first Dev role 2 months ago. The company that I’m currently with is great, with the only downside being that I’m underpaid (which is understandable since this is my first role). 

Furthermore, I interviewed with a company during the same time I’d interviewed with the current company i’m with. 

Said company has reached out to me this morning, offering me a role that would increase my salary by 40% (putting me within market value for a junior dev). 

The role would consist of my same technologies that I’m using at my current company, though at a higher level which would be beneficial in the long run. 

I feel extremely bad leaving my current company hanging after 1 month, especially with them giving me an opportunity with them for my first role.

1912,cscareerquestions,How does better fundamentals in OOP/Data Structures and Algorithms make you a better SWE?,"What I want to understand is how doing online courses in OOP and data structures and algorithms is conducive to being a better programmer. I get the intuition behind it (I mean, you can only be such a great writer if you don’t nail your grammar/sentence mechanics) but I don’t think my hours studying DSA has ever come in handy in my working experience as a SWE (other than Big O, which I still use to evaluate my code + when optimizing my code).

When I asked my manager for clarification on what he meant by brushing up on OOP/DSA fundamentals, he said that it would be useful for debugging (which, I don’t doubt, but wouldn’t more experience with the framework at hand be more beneficial for debugging?), I should have picked up on ‘big picture ideas’ in Django as opposed to looking up the documentation for every small minute detail (e.g. for those familiar with Django, he suggested that I should have just done something like

    for order in Orders.Object.filter():      time = object.created_time  

instead of using

    queryset = Orders.objects.filter().value_list('created_time') 

each time in a different function) which… I also get, but I’m also an unexperienced programmer picking up four new technologies in a month - of course my code isn’t going to be perfect/ production ready. I also gave precedence to timeliness over code quality because who gives a rat's ass about quality code when it couldn't meet the deadline.

I believe there’s a lot of truth to what my manager's saying and I do want to work well with him - just that perhaps there’s something in what he’s said that isn’t clicking for me. Would really appreciate other perspectives + advice on how I can leverage OOP/DSA to accelerate my learning in SWE!

——

Backstory for those interested:

I’ve just finished my first month as a full-time software engineer at a startup of \~30 people where I’ve been doing primarily backend and data viz work. What this means on a day-to-day basis: learning Django, SQL, Charts.js, and GCP (all from scratch) to preprocess and visualize about 1 million lines of data in real time. This was a project that was given to me to familiarise myself with Django and related technologies before proceeding to writing company code on the production server.

For context, I’m a December 2020 uni grad where I studied something completely unrelated to CS (political science and psychology). I’ve been dabbling in software since my 3rd year of uni where I completed two uni courses in CS (specifically, CS 101 and an intro to data science course), but am very much self-taught otherwise. I just had my first one-on-one with my manager today, which boiled down to things that I kind of already knew but are still hard to swallow pills -

* He can’t quite gauge my potential as a software engineer + is not entirely comfortable with me writing production code this soon because my fundamentals in (primarily OOP and data structures and algorithms) aren’t quite up to par.
* He’d be open to me being a PM as my primary role, and software as a secondary role (he’s very open + told me to take initiative to do whatever’s good for the company, which is a double edged sword, but it looks like I’ll still have opportunities to write code at work as I suggested taking ownership of the company website and he agreed... which is ?????? but we'll see). If software is still something I’m deadset on doing (which I am) he’d be willing to reconsider my ability to write production code in 6 months.

There are a few things that irked me a little about this conversation, namely:

1. the fact that three managers (two technical co-founders + 1 tech lead) hired me knowing that I’d need more support + time picking up new technologies (in their own words) but are now backing out
2. he’s giving me smaller subtasks to do when he doesn’t have the time to do code review/one-on-one (e.g. add xyz to your dashboard!), but also tells me that I spent 4 weeks doing something that a seasoned SWE could’ve done in 2-3 weeks. (Context: my manager is a start-up co-founder, so I’ve been working quite independently this entire time.)
3. he keeps comparing me to my colleague, who is an unfair comparison because he’s been a Django developer for 3-4 years - whereas this is my first ever Django project, at my first full-time SWE job. My manager acknowledges that my colleague is an unfair comparison, but it almost feels like my colleague is the benchmark for my performance.

Software is something I’d really like to get good at. While I get where he's coming from perspective, I don’t think he fully understands the fact that I did this project not knowing what he was looking for, or the fact that I \*know\* my code isn’t optimized or production ready. I’m grateful that I’m not being fired on the spot and I’m trying not to take any of this personally, but I’m a little shocked at how quickly I’m being taken out of a software role. I just want to understand how his advice can be carried out, and how it will work in practise."
1913,cscareerquestions,"Graduated December 2019, haven't had a job ever since due to the pandemic. Also I'm a foreign graduate, but I live in the States. How?","I applied to countless job applications and have had several screenings but none of them go as far as getting an interview, other than Revature (which I got an offer from, but I rejected due to numerous reasons).

Most screeners say that I have an 'impressive' background, but none actually proceeds with my application. Is that just sweet talk and I actually have a shit ass background?

In summary, I graduated from a top private university in Indonesia with a GPA of 3.32. After graduating I then moved back to the states right when the pandemic happens. As I was holding a foreign degree, haven't been back in the states for awhile and some family/personal issues relating to the coronavirus I haven't been able to actively look for a job until October 2020. I only started job hunting around December 2020 until now.

Regarding my skills, I believe I am not the best but certainly not the worst in terms of CS graduates. I can make simple mobile applications very quickly, and complex ones around a week. I know numerous popular front-end frameworks and languages and a couple of back-end ones (React, React Native, Firebase, NoSQL, SQLite, Java, C# are the ones I am comfortable with). I certainly am no master programmer and bright student but I can write software pretty consistently, albeit not the fastest. But I can get the job done. That's where I see myself.

I have had an internship just before I graduated, working as a Full-Stack Engineer. The company was pretty shitty so I had to do full-time job mostly, even more than the full-time employee. Due to that I am quite familiar with the structure of corporations and working with them.

Regarding Leetcode, I must admit that I'm not that good. Easy questions is easy but medium questions will take me a while, especially if I am not familiar. But it's not like my brain dies when I see the problems, I usually end up solving it with a brute-force after a while. While I know I'd have to improve my LC, what's the point if I'm not even getting interviews?

I have 2 personal projects but both of them are not finished. The app I made during my undergrad research is technically the property of my institution so I am not allowed to share its source code. The app was never deployed, but had a solid architecture/background that recruiters seem to be impressed when I describe this particular project during a phone screen.

But still no interviews. Heck man, I don't care if I get rejected left and right. I just don't get responses. Most applications I got rejected, even the entry-level/internship positions. This makes me wonder, **am I still eligible for entry-level/internship positions?** If so, why am I getting rejected constantly, not being able to even get a phone screen sometimes? Or should I apply to normal positions.. as a ""new"" grad?

I would greatly appreciate any help as I believe I can do the work as a software engineer. I might not be the best at it but, isn't that normal for a new grad? What can I do to get **responses**? I don't mind being rejected, **I just need answers.** At this point I don't even know where to go. I added and messaged recruiters on LinkedIn, but none of them responded even though they all added me back.

Thank you!"
1914,cscareerquestions,Making a tough career decision. Advice needed. (new grad),"I'm at a confusing point in my life, I'll try my best to keep things short.

In my final year of college, I was recruited by a Japanese firm for a very competitive salary. Then the pandemic happened and I wasn't able to go to Japan as per my joining date (late 2020). The company that hired me is a product-based one that uses only PHP as its primary language without any frameworks (LAMP). My company is quite reluctant to give me remote work and wants me to join the team on-site once I am able to come to Japan, hence I've been unemployed for a fair share of 6 months or so. Hence I've been stuck in this constant limbo of waiting for Japan to open its borders and get to work there. So, I have been thinking of alternatives, to apply for other jobs to have some financial stability mainly overseas because the pay is too low for new grads in my country. But, I have spent the last year learning PHP and brushing up on it because Java was my go-to language the past years and have forgone any kind of interview prep all soever. Tbh, I consider myself average when it comes to problem-solving and the thought of giving interviews and going through those coding rounds gives me nightmares. So here are my primary questions:

* Should I start preparing for giving interviews in the coming few months?

&gt;That would basically mean forgoing hope of making it to Japan by all means and making *Cracking the coding interview* my bible and going through it for 5-6 hours a day whilst practicing problem-solving online (Leetcode). This would also mean I'd have to let go of PHP entirely as it personally prefer Java over it and spend a few weeks in the end building up to date Java projects (1-2) for my resume. I would need atleast 3-4 months to be interview ready at the state I am currently.

OR

* Should I wait and prep for the job I already have secured?

&gt;I already had put in a lot of work, sleepless nights studying DSA and have gone though that whole interview process to secure that kick-ass job in 2019. Should I just give up on it because the borders aren't likely to open till late October 2021? Or should I just wait patiently and practice PHP as much as I can, while building a few personal projects and learning a framework (Laravel) and make sure I am a valuable asset to the company I will be joining.   
&gt;  
&gt;This would eliminate all the peer pressure of applying for jobs and giving interviews but the only problem is I have no clue when I will be flying to Japan and my career would actually start and I would see that email/sms of my first paycheck deposited into my account.

So here I am, a junior developer who hasn't even started his tech career yet in a dilemma now, any sort of advice from experienced veterans would be helpful.

1915,cscareerquestions,Let go from a position after 2 months of work. Was I the problem?,"So a little background.

I've worked for two companies over the past 1.5 years since graduating college. From my first position, I had furloughed from COVID19 but was working as a Java/Full-Stack dev. This job was over the course of about 7 months before my furlough. I got an offer to get training for an Appian position with 10 weeks of training, so I decided to take the offer. Eventually, that position had to lay me off at the end of 2020 due to budget changes in the contract. 

In Jan of 2021, I got hired for another contract to work as an Appian backend dev with testing. This was a Junion position. I've been let go at the end of March due to performance. I didn't have any prior mentions of issues from my team lead or co-workers about this, and to be honest the general environment around there seemed tense as we were due to ship the project by April 2021. 

I think that perhaps the biggest issue was the fact that because I was new I needed to learn the project, which was very dense at this point being near the end of development. But because senior devs were so busy with the project, along with my team lead, I rarely got mentoring or feedback on my work. 

\-I always made it a priority to communicate my goals every sprint, to reach out if I got stuck somewhere in the project as I didn't want to idle.

\-I contributed my own ideas in team meetings about how to go about implementing solutions to problems. Some of my ideas got integrated into the project.

\-Checking to make sure I was working efficiently and not going off and doing work that wasn't critical like refactoring or bug fixing.

I did make mistakes due to me being new, most of them coming from the fact that I was learning both how the project was integrated and doing development. Things like having to correct documentation, correct test cases, or getting feedback on pseudocode I wrote didn't get sent to prod (It never did, we had multiple levels of peer review to make sure such a thing didn't happen). Sometimes I needed to have mentoring because I could get 75% of the work off the ground with the amount of knowledge I had.

The biggest thing that got to me was every story that was assigned to me was completed by the deadline. I never had it rollover. I pushed myself to work overtime on weekends to get stuff done. Although my senior co-worker told me he was concerned about the project if juniors were having to do that. I know for a fact I wasn't the fastest developer, but I wasn't the slowest either. As a team, a trend was that almost every user story was getting done only 1-2 days before the deadline.

In the end, I was working on bug fixes and documenting the changes made to the codebase when I was pulled into the office, told I had issues with my performance and was out of a job. My best guess was due to the fact that I wasn't pushed out stories fast enough or taking on enough. Which I don't understand as I asked my team lead to give me more work if it was needed. One specific case was me offering to do 10 points for a sprint and being told to do 5 because they didn't want me to get overwhelmed. I tried to argue that every story I did was always meeting deadlines and I was confident in my work but in the end, I was placed where I was by my team lead who I loved working with.

In the end, I was pulled into the office when I had been there for close to 3 months. I was told I was being let go due to performance. I had never received any warnings on it from anyone. Nothing was documented or provided to me in that meetings. I didn't want to argue with them as burning bridges was a risk in my mind.

I am looking for work with interviews coming up next week for junior dev roles, but this stuff scares the shit out of me. Did I fail them, did they fail me, or was it a combination of both?"

It may be a long shot, but are there any companies that take people in my situation with VERY little knowledge, hire them, and train them up to a certain point where they can form a good knowledge base and contribute to the company?  I’m located in the DFW area. Thanks for any insight!"

I primarily do iOS work, but I find myself increasingly interested in backend problems, especially building services that can scale to large numbers of users.

1935,cscareerquestions,Ideas for coding projects to work with a friend.,"My friend and I are both majoring in computer science. I applied for a few internships in which I got rejected by some and still waiting to hear back from the rest. But, I do have a feeling I won't get them either due to my lack of experience. So instead of being bummed out by that, I wanted to create my own projects over the summer and I want it to be a collaborative project instead of a solo one. 

The problem is that I'm currently lacking the creativity part and coming up with project ideas. Preferably something I can show off in my portfolio. I'm not sure what career path in computer science I'm interested in, so that's also hindering my ideas. 

Currently, I have knowledge in C, C++, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Meteor, MongoDB, Semantic UI, React, and still working on my algorithms. 

I know there are a lot of ideas online already but I also want to personally ask here just in case someone has also been in my situation. So, any suggestions? I would also love to know what projects you were able to create at the beginning of your CS journey."
1936,cscareerquestions,Should I tell the real reason why I am switching jobs is due to location?,"I am thinking about switching jobs because I want to be closer to my parents (the other coast where I grew up). I will still be in a different city, but it's a 2 or 3 hours of driving if I really need to go to them. I know in interviews, they will ask why I am looking to switch jobs. Aside from the textbook answers of ""new opportunity, learn new technologies, meet new smart people, blah blah blah"", should I just truthfully mention that I really like the location as well? Since it allows me to be closer to my parents, and that I would like to be able to visit them conveniently (relatively).

I think sincere honesty doesn't hurt, but I am afraid they may think this could potentially mean I am expecting an emergency soon, which hopefully isn't the case. But, it may distract me from work, even though for a little bit in my opinion.

But people often say that LinkedIn is the only way to get noticed by recruiters, so I feel compelled to make a profile.

I don't know if its because I'm working too slowly so my manager is giving me less or that there really isn't much going on. Sometimes i reach out to my co-workers for work and i'll get a small tasks here and there to fill up my time.

A consultancy felt me out for price, I said 90k would be a nice big round number I'd be happy with which got the phone screener to laugh. He said very doable and probed to see if it was a raise from the previous job which I confirmed. The subtleties of the exchange made me feel I underbid.

My package:
Start is ~46k and after 6 months probation, it goes up to ~48k.
My second year I'm looking at around low 50 and by my third year, high 50 to low 60.

They said this was part of their plan for training entry level software developers.

I realized I'm being underpaid (average in my state is 50-55k for entry level SDE which is low considering high COL) but the pandemic has been really rough on my state. This is the only company I heard back from, the rest ghosted or rejected me.

I'm now looking for my second job after switching fields, and I'm seriously considering going through LinkedIn first; I'm either going to message corporate recruiters first, or reply to one of the many third party recruiters messaging me.



However, are they actually useful for getting a job?  My experience with third party recruiters has been nothing but negative.



It seems like every time I have a call with them, they either forget about our scheduled call, tell me at the end of the call that it's a 6 month contracting position, the position is located in the middle of nowhere, they make a big deal in the middle of the call that I don't know a specific frontend framework, or they just ghost me after the call.




TLDR: In my experience, third party recruiter calls are a waste of 30 minutes, and I typically ignore all messages from them."

I was afraid I wouldn't be able to secure an internship for this summer and that I wouldn't be able to extend my contract with company ""A"" so I decided to ask them about it early and they sent me an extension letter without hesitation (which included a raise for the summer as well) and I accepted it immediately. 

Turns out I recently got an interview at some company ""B"" and I really want to work there (they contacted me a month and a half after I applied so I had presumed meanwhile that they were not gonna follow up with my application).

So here's the problem, do I even bother to go to the interview for ""B""? If I had the choice between ""A"" and ""B"" with no prior experience, I would choose ""B"" but the story is different now.  

If I get the job, is declining the extension contract for ""A"" that I literally asked for a possibility? I feel like I would be burning bridges.

When I joined the company during the induction day, they mentioned we were going to have our CV's enhanced, however, they didn't show us what our enhanced CV is going to look like. During the call with them, they sent the contract and was soon briefed by a lawyer about the contract and was given little to no time as they demanded that we sign it straight away.

During the training, we were given maximum of 2-3hours of training but was soon lessened to 1 hr maximum a day when we're supposed to get 4 hours. They kept giving us codelabs to do using sites similar to w3schools which is something we can just google.

Near the end of our training, we were shown our CV's and none of the experience was mine, I didn't know what most of the technologies were and we didn't study all of them. I'm supposed to have 5+ years of experience and a senior. We were told to lie about our location if asked and were told to delete/hibernate our linkln.

I said I don't want to use the CV they gave me because its committing fraud, they then fired me the very next day. Soon after, their legal team sent me an email demanding £16k, saying that it's for the training. I'm currently seeking legal advice but as far as I'm concerned, they have no footing on this.

1973,cscareerquestions,Stop DMing for referrals,"For some context I work at a company that is discussed here a lot and is known for having FAANG level interviews. DMing a stranger on LinkedIn for a referral or asking to be introduced to someone who can refer you doesn’t work 99% of the time. People DO NOT/WILL NOT refer people they don’t know. 

Regardless of referrals, nothing will get you out of the interviews (sure a referral can land you the interview, not denying that). Practice your Leetcode, architecture/systems design, and LEARN HOW TO INTERVIEW AND NOT BE A WEIRDO:

-	SHOW how YOU are a good fit
-	Research the company and give SPECIFIC examples from your experience to the interviewers on what the company is doing and why YOU WOULD BE A GOOD FIT in the context of what they do
-	For the note above, it’s important you come across as AUTHENTIC as possible

I have run hiring for my teams in the past and that last interview skill has been the deciding factor 100% of the time when comparing candidates at the offer stage. 

I took the time to write this out because I see so much emphasis on the technical skills in this subreddit — if you’re offered the interview it’s been determined at the surface level you’ll be technically competent, now they just want proof. Most candidates severely lack in the softer interviewing skills and, from my personal experience, I can guarantee the soft skills can be make or break even if you’re slightly technically weaker than another candidate."

1978,cscareerquestions,Have you ever switched jobs and shocked by the differences?,"I joined a startup in 2019 as a software engineer fresh graduate. The tech lead was reviewing everyone's pull requests. He used to code too, but he no longer had enough time to do it so he just review. He was knowledgeable and will answer any questions given to him. He would comment on our PRs. He left and was replaced by a new person but with a different title, Chief Technology Officer. I think this new person is way knowledgeable in seeing the whole perspective and also had a lot of experience in other workplace. At first, he didn't give any comment on our PRs, eventhough he was put on every PR's reviewers. Any comments from him is very rare. I think its because we were working on the old legacy code, a monolithic application. Its understandable that he didnt know the details about it as much as the old tech lead.

Approaching the end of 2020, we started to build microservices for a new product. But now it has been a messy project for me and my colleagues since there's very little coding guidelines. The way I code may be different from my team members. I had a senior who is also my manager but he rarely comments on my PR anymore. I don't blame him for this, I just feel no one establishes the coding guidelines. My leader also still gives very few comments and on a rare basis on our PRs. I thought he was really busy and we shouldnt bother him on small detailed coding guidelines.

Recently I took a software engineering job as a part timer. So, I still worked at my old place but will spend 4 hours/day for this new job. The tech lead this new job surprised me. He is very knowledgeable and would arrange online workshops for him to summarise about key concepts of a framework or a solution to solve problems. He would arrange a meeting immediately when someone is stuck or needs help. He had a diagram prepared to show me the current infrastructure.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been excusing the absence of feedback in my PRs thinking my leader was busy or having a meeting. Thinking he would change as soon we get clear product requirements.

I was admitted into a project last September working remotely from home as a frontend Developer using React Js and absolutely loved it everything about it. Unfortunately, I joined the project quite late in the development and came into an end this January. I was sent back to bench and last week got a new project offer. The position would be of a Test Engineer doing QA. Now, this positions domain is in Telecom, and all testing is being done on site and it requires me to move to a new city 1500 miles away from my current place. I felt pressured to accept the offer as I wasn't given any time to think of the offer and thought it would look bad on me if I said no. There is no salary raise on this new position however they are covering all moving expenses.  But I'm now having major second thoughts. Not only because of moving from my home and leaving my friends but also for the position itself. I'm realizing that I want be a web developer. I absolutely loved working with React and seeing my work come to live and feel like I became quite good at it.

1982,cscareerquestions,Quitting my job to focus on transitioning into Development and seeking advice,"**Disclaimer:** Throw away account since friends / coworkers know my main account and I am not ready for this to be public knowledge.

**Backstory:** I am currently in the IT field working for an options trading firm. I'm making good money but absolutely HATE everything about my job / career path and need to get back to what I've always loved doing. I attended an A tier university and in the middle of my Sophomore year of a CS degree when I earned an internship that quickly turned into a nice paid salary position. I was going to school part time and paying my way through and decided after the full time bump it was not worth continuing my schooling. 

**Current:** I am preparing to take my bonus and live off my savings for a few months to a year and grind the development path. I've been taking React / Web dev classes and have several projects on my resume. I want to spend all the 60+ hours a week I've been working and put that into learning the skills I need to get hired as a developer. I have several friends / communities where I will be working on projects further adding to my resume / portfolio. 

**Plan:** My current plan is to have my life revolve around the following:

* Projects with others (learn real world experience) 
* Grind leetcode / hackerrank
* Continue becoming proficient in
   * JS / CSS / HTML
   * React
   * PostgreSQL
   * GIT
   * Node.JS / Express.JS

**Conclusion:** I would love any suggestions / tips / helpful critique to aid me moving in the right direction."

So I did but decided to start applying elsewhere because it would take too long to find a job by the time I realized I didn't like the project. Well i'm very deep into an interview process with a company, in fact too deep. Over the course of 3 months i've had 5 interviews, two of them being hiring managers and one of them the director, all who gave me great reviews. The final interview was with the 2nd hiring manager and the team i'd be working with. That was a month ago. Two weeks ago I reached out to the recruiter asking for an update and she said that she was sorry it was taking so long but they are still doing interviews. I'm sick of waiting, but I really want the position, and I also just received an email from my manager about a position transfer opening. I don't want to have my manager start advocating for me and then this company give me an offer and leaving. Can I reach out to the recruiter and tell them that i've received an offer and ask them to speed up the decision making?"
1986,cscareerquestions,How to navigate job hunting phase? Need advice,"Hello my question is I currently am in the job hunting phase and received a written offer from a company(not number one choice), with an end of the week deadline to decide.   I am aware I can ask for an extension on that but it would be nice to start now and start making some money (they also want me to start soon) .  That being said I have been moved along to other company final interview phase for a possible more desirable spot (possible slight more pay) but would not hear back for 2/3 weeks after all the interviews are complete.  Also no guarantees from them. 

How would you navigate a situation where you you receive an acceptable first offer but are still in the process for a second(though not guaranteed) company?  The two extremes seem odd (decline and risk getting neither or reneged after a couple of weeks of onboarding) what is the happy medium?"

1988,cscareerquestions,Second degree student offered internship (but I have to pay )! Need advice if I should take it.,"Hi there,

I need some advice whether or not to take this summer virtual internship offer. The only catch is that I have to pay the company that is offering the internship as well as pay my university as it will count towards a course credit. Overall, it will end up costing me an average of $3000CAD. I am a second degree student in computer science, my previous degree is a BSc in Biomedical Science and I am looking for some work experience in the computer science field.

1993,cscareerquestions,How to not give up on job search,"I have been looking for another software developer job in southern Ontario (Canada) after getting laid off last December. I have managed to land a few interviews (phone and Zoom) but no offers have ever materialized. I have been applying mostly to Indeed and LinkedIn and my networking is limited. I have also been ghosted by two recruiters. All applications that have not resulted in rejection have been ghosted. Despite my 3 years of professional experience in this field, the rejections and ghostings are making me question whether I am good enough for any job in this field as it feels like there is always someone better.

I have started working with medical professionals and am considering taking leave under FMLA so that I can make progress quicker.

But if I really am helped by taking leave, there's a reasonable chance I don't return to the job afterwards, either because I stay unemployed so I have more time to work on myself, or because I go back to school or take a different job which has a more relaxed pace. If I take leave, will it look bad if I don't come back afterwards? Would it be better for me to just quit?"

The second interview went really good the interviewer spoke arabic i solved the question and explained my thought process and the behavioral part i think went pretty good .
so i did 2 out of 3 questions and i believe i did good on the behavioral part ,is that enough or i lost it ?"

2003,cscareerquestions,How to study CS fundamentals/what to learn before taking the Systems course (in C),"Hi,

I'm starting my grad school program in CS in May and need to take a Systems course in C. I come from a background in Stats &amp; Econ and use Python daily at my current job as a Data Scientist, but do not have the fundamentals in CS down yet. I will be spending the next three months filling in the personal gaps to do well in school and transition to an SWE/MLE track.

I have a few very rookie questions for you guys:

1. Is C wildly different from C++? There seem to be more online classes for C++.
2. Good online courses/books for learning C from scratch.
3. The Holy Bible courses/books for Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (I just want to know enough to excel technical interviews).
4. Any and all pointers on what to study in what sequence"
2004,cscareerquestions,Just got a Job Offer for my first internship!,"I am so incredibly happy that I finally got a job offer for my very first internship!

It is for a Data Scientist intern position at a big Fortune 500 company. Honestly, I didn't expect it at all! After roughly 70 applications and 5 interviews, I finally landed one. I have no work experience and no part-time or volunteering experience either. I have a good GPA (3.8/4) and a few personal projects. I am currently in my sophomore year at university.

After around 2 months of applying and getting rejected by many companies, even ones that I have passed several rounds of interviews for, I thought I wouldn't get an internship for the summer and felt completely hopeless. But I learnt a lot from the failed interviews that I had and I finally aced my last interview that resulted in this offer.

Do anyone have any tips or advice for how I should prepare for this internship? I am so excited and I really want to succeed in this internship."
2005,cscareerquestions,CS seems like such an easy path. What am I missing?,"Hello all,

Just want to start out with that I’m not trying to be ignorant but just want to better understand. 

I am currently a junior at a well known, public university known for engineering. While I’m majoring in Industrial Engineering, nearly half of my friends (as well as around 35% of undergrad student body) are majoring in Computer Science. 

Compared with my course load, it seems they have much less work to do and have more free time throughout the day. Further, in terms of jobs, 90% of my CS friends have secured multiple FAANG, Uber, Microsoft etc internship offers seemingly without much effort and will be getting paid easily $30k over the summer and I assume high $100ks post graduation. 

The amount of effort expended as well as the potential returns for CS compared to other disciplines like engineering, medicine, etc seem too good to be true. 

Assuming you go to college with the only purpose of making money (regardless of interests), CS seems like  a fairly easy way. 

What am I misunderstanding? Or is this truly how CS is?"
2006,cscareerquestions,Looking for some advice on how best to direct my career with 1.5 years of experience,"# Backstory

I'm a 2020 AAS webdev grad, in a low CoL area USA.

In May 2019 I had finished my capstone project, but was a few required courses short of graduation because I'd had scheduling conflicts that came as a result of starting school part time. However, the capstone presentations were publicly presented and one of the local start ups liked my project. I interviewed with them, and they said that while the role they were offering wouldn't pay great, if I was interested in the experience, they would love to have me. I accepted a full time salaried role as a junior software developer at this company making around $34k/year, no benefits. It definitely felt like an internship but I was able to take the remainder of my classes online or at night, and I got a ton of actual hands on experience on frontend projects with AngularJS, from May 2019, until two weeks after graduation in May 2020, when I was laid off because of the virus decimating their revenue streams.

In mid October, following a few interviews that went nowhere, and well over a hundred applications, I got a phone screen into an interview with an ecommerce vendor local to my area. They hired me as a junior web developer working on some netsuite scripts, and their Magento 2 codebase. 

# Now

My title is junior web developer; I get 43k/year plus benefits; 3weeks PTO, 3% 401k match, 80% healthcare premium covered, plus 50% eye and dental. My total compensation valuation by them I believe is around 52k/year.

I like my new employer a lot and enjoy all the people I work with. The only other developer (the lead) is awesome and very patient and despite only having around 3.5 years of experience, we've bonded over the fact that we're both the same age-ish (early 30s) and went back to school for programming later in life. We get along incredibly well, I am really grateful for his guidance. Additionally, work life balance is great. I've literally never once clocked over 40hrs a week, and I work from home full time due to the pandemic. Management has openly expressed that we will not do full or part time WFH when restrictions loosen. My commute isn't bad, 15-20 min, but the offices are open concept, and I feel like I'd do much better work here at home.

# My Concerns

&amp;#x200B;

1.  I think I am being underpaid for what I do. Which is honestly not a huge deal to me right now, but I feel like it will be an significant issue down the road. I was able to learn SuiteScript in about two weeks, and Magento from scratch in about six weeks. I've now been here 4 months, I am clearing tons of tasks that the lead hasn't been able to tackle due to time constraints, and am pulling my weight on bigger projects too. All of his feedback has been emphatically positive. And yet, in a meeting I had with our boss about what I should expect in my semi-annual compensation meeting, I was told that I was rated 'at expectation' and unless I really wowed them, I should expect only a 2% inflation raise every 6mo comp period. My concern is, the lead fully intends for me to be a fullstack developer with complete shared ownership of all projects and the code base. In our personal action plan meetings, we've laid out a roadmap for how he will help me get there by the end of 2021; I am already way ahead of his schedule, his words. But that title change is not considered a promotion, because those are my intended long term responsibilities from the point of hire. This seems problematic to me; they want to invest in training me and developing my abilities, but would like to continue to pay me a jr front end salary? Should I be concerned about this? I don't expect to be paid 100k; even locally, entry level CS grads are making 60-80k. Or should I drop that notion since I don't have a CS degree, regardless of any experience? 
2. I don't hate Magento the way a lot of developers seem to, but I am worried by the common narrative that it is a career dead end. I am more interested in NodeJS and Django applications and not at all interested in developing for CMS or ecommerce platforms. I am also a much better JS programmer than I am with PHP. How dangerous would it be for my career to stay in this role as a Magento dev for 2-3 years getting no pro level experience with my target technologies, when that's where I want to ultimately go as a mid-level? I have a couple personal project ideas floating around in my head that I would like to build in React, but I am afraid that won't be enough for consideration if my professional work is a completely different language and stack.

The situation is certainly some kind of mix of good and bad. I want to be clear, I know how lucky and privileged I am to have found a sustainable job with very limited credentials in the middle of covid. Regardless, I am posting this in the hopes of getting input from some much more experienced developers to tell me if my concerns are unfounded, and offer advice/suggestions. I chose to learn programming after struggling very hard as a young adult in my twenties, so I don't have much experience with how I manage my career. Before this I bounced around a number of different low pay labor jobs with zero specialized skills. I don't have a lot of confidence in my current thought process or mindset when it comes to the bigger picture.

Appreciate any and all feedback. Thanks!"
2007,cscareerquestions,What are my chances of getting admit into postgraduate programs in US with low GPA?,"I've been working as a software developer for nearly 2 years in India. During my days in university, I spent all of my time on online judges such as Codeforces and SPOJ solving problems on algorithms &amp; data structures. Although I had a low GPA (2.7), I was able to secure internships in Walmart Labs and Amazon. I also secured 99+ percentile in GATE (Indian examination for admission into postgraduate programmes), where I had to study topics such as operating systems, computer networks, compiler design etc in depth. I'm currently working in a robotics project which I enjoy working on but I really want to explore research in emerging fields in CS.

2008,cscareerquestions,I'm a very bad worker. But I love my job.,"So I'm eighteen, and I love programming. I may not be the best one, but I'm not the worst one, I'd say I'm average. 

But I'm so, SO chaotic. I don't know if it is thanks to my ADHD, which I'm not sure if I even have it.

But I'm a bad worker, I'd say. I've got my first job in my beloved field, good paying one, the dudes there are just chill af, most of the times. But I often find that I just do stupid shit, like for example, I need a command from the VS Dev console, but I'm stressing why tf isn't my script working from CMD... Then I realize I should be running it from the VS DEV console. 

Ot, this happened like 15 minutes ago, I connected to a remote desktop using RDP and a VPN. and I'm trying to solve why the heck my internet on the remote PC isn't working, well I pop up the VPN and disconnect. Now I'm locked from the PC and stuck feeling like a dumb bufoon. And I'm kinda scared of telling the dude. So I'm probably not telling him.

I know, this is probably more of a rant about my inability to do jack-all, but can anybody tell me if: 

* You have a similar issue to mine
* You have some tips for me
* How often do you guys higher in the hierarchy encounter idiots such as myself
* Anything else that would be useful

Thanks a million, happy programming and stay safe!!!!!!"
2009,cscareerquestions,"Self taught, finally solidified myself as a senior mobile developer. What should I do next?","I taught myself Android/Java about 6 years ago. After struggling for 2-3 years, I was able to get a foothold in the industry by finding my first programming job. I'm now leaving my first job, and have a new position as a senior Android developer at a fortune 100 company. It's an exciting moment for me - a good rate of pay, a fully remote job, and the word senior in my job title. For me, this feels like mission accomplished, I completed my goal of becoming a developer.

So, what should I do next? I'm 32 years old, I have a solid understanding of Android, and have a few AWS certifications, including cloud architect. 

A few ideas that I have - 

Broaden my skillset. Eventually I'd like to be in a management position, or perhaps start a company. I'll need more than just Android knowledge to do that.

Get even better at Android - understand it well enough that I really become an expert, and can be a go to guy for Android at this company.

Work on my leadership and soft skills- try to really understand the business needs of the company and figure out how to get things done effectively. Learn to speak up more in meetings, etc.

Study interview questions and get a better job at a really heavy hitting tech company - my current company is large, but not known for being a tech powerhouse exactly. It might be nice to try to get a job at a Facebook or Google level company.

Thoughts? Which option do you think would serve me best?"
2010,cscareerquestions,What to do?,"Hey all,

I’m currently a UK student doing CS at a reputable uni and in my 3rd year. I’m really depressed as a result of the covid situation and the fact that there are hardly any internships in the city I go to uni in. I was hoping to do an internship to boost my chances of getting a nice job but clearly that’s not the case. I don’t think i’ll be able to move to a different city due to financial reasons. So i’ve rounded up a few possible options but would like to get opinions.

Option 1: Check for Uni based internships

So this is seems like the best of option, however, i’m worried that I won’t find something I like, especially since they’re research based etc. But if I do find one which interests me, I will most defo apply.

Option 2: “intern” for my fathers business and create a web based application

This I view as cheating bcos it’s my fathers business so I obviously won’t be getting an “office experience”, however, I will be getting web application experience which I guess I could slap onto my CV. My father is actually in need of a new website so I could essentially intern under his company and state my process of making a website. I’m just not sure if companies will like the idea of someone working for family.

Option 3: Practise leetcode and just do random projects

This is the only other thing I can think of, altho I would really like to earn money this year but I guess I can do projects and get a crappy retail job. 


Do I really need an internship to get a nice grad job out of uni? Most of my mates have one now and it’s really made me depressed, especially since most of them live in big cities and I won’t be able to afford travelling. Would also like to know if my options are feasible.

Thanks!"

Knowing cloud platforms change pretty rapidly, would there be any value in investing time and money into this right now?"
2012,cscareerquestions,"Want to stick with CS, but hate SWE culture. Get MS/PhD?","I've been in software for a long time, and I'm quite frankly disgusted by the immaturity of the culture. I can't stand Scrum, open-plan offices aggravate my otherwise manageable disability, and the ubiquitous bad code that exists due to short-term thinking and business-driven engineering is something I find intolerable, simply below worthiness of my finite time on this planet.

That said, I love programming, CS, and math. I enjoy what computers can do. I just hate so much of what they actually do. And of course I hate the sleaze that has been injected into the tech industry by late-stage capitalism, but who doesn't?

Is getting a Master's in computer science a good investment? What about a PhD? I'm probably too old to be in contention for tenure-track jobs (I'm 37 now) but I wouldn't mind taking an industry job if it's a non-toxic, R&amp;D sort of environment.

Will getting more education set me up for better career options? Or has the Agile cancer spread so far that even with a PhD one cannot escape it?"

A few months into learning how to make a simple ios app, I realised that Im very passionate about this. So I made a plan, a rough plan of what Im gonna be doing in the next 28 months of highschool, because I came to the realization that I have a lot more free time than i think I do and I can spend this time on something that can be extremely helpful and important one day. I included, ios and web dev, AI and ML, graphic design, some CS related maths (that I wouldn't be taught in school). Since the majority here is way more experienced than i am, I wanted to ask you guys, what else you would put on the list, and what can I do in this time that would be useful to my future CS career."
2017,cscareerquestions,"Just got a huge offer, where do I go from here?","Hello!

To just give a little background, I grew up in a family of 6 and we weren't the wealthiest people around. We were technically in poverty given our level of income and number of people in our family. My dad worked really hard to make sure we all got a good education and helped us in any way he could etc.. etc..

Thanks to him, I've been super technically capable. I ended up going to a decent college for CS and over this last year I've been dreading the potential reality that I may not find a job. I started applying like crazy and hey, what do you know? A few companies actually showed genuine interest in me, which felt amazing.

I did really well in the interview process and now I'm sitting with a six figure offer which also includes a 10k relocation bonus. It's also in a relatively low cost of living area, which is great. I teared up yesterday when I got the phone call. I wrote down the details of the offer on paper but my hand was shaking like crazy. All I could think about was how I could finally do whatever I wanted and also live on my own and not have to share a room.

I accepted the offer a few hours later but I still haven't told any of my friends. My dad told me not to tell anyone and I'm also afraid of what might come as a result of telling people. I'm not super close with anyone but most of my friends are CS majors. One of them actually graduated last semester and got a 78k offer and I couldn't stop telling him how jealous I was of him. He actually had internship experience too and I didn't so I totally thought my first offer would be lower than his. My other friends opted to do masters degrees to get a better shot at finding jobs. Again, I don't have a master's degree and here I am with an amazing offer.

2018,cscareerquestions,Unpaid internship,"Should I go for an unpaid internship?

I’ve been looking for my first software engineer internship for a bit now, but I’ve had the greatest of challenges. I am undocumented. 
That means my chances of getting my first internships are close to 0. I’m planning to move back home (Europe) because of this, but I want to graduate in the US. 
In the meantime, I’ve seen an opportunity to go for unpaid internships, just for the experience. 
It sucks because I know other companies would pay well, but there’s nothing I can do about my situation. 
Is it worth the experience to get an unpaid internship considering my situation?"
2019,cscareerquestions,Has anybody quit due to embarrassment/shame?,"I don't want to type a full thing out because nobody will read it, but basically:

- I joined a company as a new grad last year

- Over time I worked on a lot of tickets and there are about 10-20 tickets outstanding at different stages (waiting to be tested, approved, just not started at all, etc)

- I have a major deadline coming up soon for a different manager because it got pushed a couple times and my current manager is setting me up for failure (giving me the cold shoulder, and also not doing his part that is required). I admit I'm kind of disorganized.

At this point my manager is currently interviewing potential candidates to join the team. I feel like recently he has been giving me the cold shoulder and I have a feeling he is going to get rid of me very soon.

I thought things would get sour quick early on so I've been applying to jobs since the beginning of January. I had a job offer back in January that paid more at a better company, but I rejected it in hopes for a better one. I'm currently interviewing with a few companies right now and I'm in the mid/final stages and I don't know if I'll get an offer soon or not.

I'm honestly really embarrassed that it has came down to this. If I quit tomorrow this would be all over but that would be unprofessional. Should I just wait until they let me go or just give my two weeks and just tough it out?"

2022,cscareerquestions,Contract vs full time rate,"I am an experienced data scientist working within the banking sector. I just got an offer to interview at another bank for a contractor role or a full time role.

Their full time role doesn’t interest me as the max salary below what I am currently paid. However the contract hourly rate seems lucrative and the monthly salary after taxes could be 1.7 times higher to what I am currently earning.

It would be a 6 months with a possible extension afterwards. However, now I am thinking that not only would I have less stability but also my holidays would be unpaid (Europe, currently I have more than a month a year of paid vacation, also we have quite a lot of national holidays), no sick leave etc. So although I was excited at first, now I am having second thoughts.

So I would like to discuss - what is the reasonable rate  multiplicator for a contractor job? I still have the opportunity to negotiate."

Note: I have had a bit of bad luck with jobs so far and I am living in Europe.

1) Rising Start-Up that deals in Stocks and Cryptocurrency that has been in the Market for 2 Years and has profitted big time over COVID and the recent GameStop Story. They are a small team of 8 Engineers (including myself), but they are looking to hire as many people as they possibly can. I am being offered on-boarding process, 55K Salary + 5K Bonus, Newest MacBook Pro, Stock Options and if I ever need a Certificate Training they provide it. In short, they have a lot of money. It is in a city where I dont live but the recruitment company is helping me with a relocation package (finding an apartment and moving my stuff).

2) Large Coorperation with branches all over the country and have a total of 1200 people and want to keep expanding who been in the market over 20 Years. Its a Internet Software Company and they were never affected by the Pandemic. They have multiple branches but where I will be working there are about 40 Engineers. And since it is a large company, they provide training and if I ever want to do a certificate they pay for it. It also has a HR department (I heard here is where you dont have to worry about being fired). They have super nice office designs with ergonomic setup. I can choose my hardware. 50K Salary. This is in my city where I live. But I dont want to stay in this city because I live with parents and recently my grandparents moved in as well because they both have cancer and my mom needs to look after them.

What sort of life is this? A grown man in his mid-twenties still living with his parents and grandparents. I would move out but it is hella difficult because in the country I live in especially in those big cities. There is a) A housing shortage (So not enough apartments) and b) because I am a different race I will most likely lose to the other guy wanting the apartment who is of that countries origin. (Yes my country has that race problem. Its still the same with jobs, despite it being illegal it still happens...thats why most resumes from recruiters are given anonymously). But come on they wont say ""Oh we will not hire you because your from XYZ"". 

Anyway gotten off topic, in short words I cant decide. They are both great firms, cool people...but there is that size difference...I honestly cant decide. I am going in on Friday to sign the contract at the large firm because they want I start at 15th March and the Start Up on the 1st April. 

Any suggestions?"
2036,cscareerquestions,Should I push through front-end web dev?,"I’m coming from usually posting in r/ITCareerQuestions. So I’m pivoting from IT support and operations to trying out web dev. I already have a non-related bachelors (not STEM). Naturally I prefer backend due to enjoying nfrastructure and server-side systems. But I’ve been told entry level backend and entry level DevOps opportunities do not really exist. I’ve researched that I’ll need to transition laterally from front end. I really don’t enjoy front end that much. I like knowing how a website works from beginning to end, so I wouldn’t mind being full stack, but the thought of just solely working on front end sounds draining. 

Should I apply for these jobs and just stick it out? What’s the timeline from transitioning to backend or full stack for someone who does not have a CS degree? Sorry if my post screams naive, I can handle criticism if this is out of place."

I feel like the business is just dumping all the responsibility onto me and I 'm not only having to design the application side but also the business process side and gather requirements. Sometimes I am given what seems like a simple task but as I'm working on it I realize this will impact business process x,y, and z but this was never mentioned before. How did they not realize this? Am I supposed to just know this or gather all the requirements myself? We did have one consultant that seemed to agree with me but when things were brought up they just said they were using agile methodology, but to me it seems laziness and incompetence. Sometimes I wonder if I should just do exactly what they say and let them realize their request doesn't make sense.

Am I right to feel frustrated? I realize in a bigger team we would have more clearly defined roles, but even given our small team is this reasonable? I guess I am too inexperienced to know better.

2048,cscareerquestions,Some concerns after a recent meeting with my manager regarding my performance,"I (mid 20s female) wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/lajb1m/distraught_after_a_meeting_today_with_my_manager/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about a month ago (I lost my login tho), and I wanted to link this just so there is some more context for my situation. It is a pretty long post, but the gist of it is basically that my manager sat me down about a month ago to inform me that there has been a noticeable drop in my performance compared to before the pandemic, and that if I don’t “wake up” then...it’s likely that things will go in a very bad direction (and thankfully he didn’t write a PIP). We reached a mutual agreement that I would address the personal factors impacting my performance and that I’d do better. Anyways, a day or two after that meeting, I was given a couple of time-intensive tasks, and it is (so far) seeming like people have been happy with how I’m doing on them. One of these tasks is being scrum-master. 

I have seen people on this sub say that being scrum-master doesn’t take up much time at all, but in my case, my team (actually...the branch I work under for my company) is basically doing a whole “structural” overhaul in trying to implement Agile, so my days for a while have basically been a lot of back-to-back meetings (and I’m literally driving a lot of these meetings), “admin-type” stuff as I help my team get ramped up with adjusting to the Agile development process, planning things out, taking care of roadblocks for others, etc. Basically...it’s taken up a good chunk of my time (along with another task I have been given since that “talk” with my manager). And because I’ve been driving so many meetings, my involvement in all this has been pretty visible. 

Although I’m really grateful to have been given “another chance” (or at least that’s how me and the people in that other thread have been seeing it), there are couple of...thoughts/concerns I’ve been having. One is that I have literally stopped getting *any* technical work whatsoever and that I’ve just been essentially working slideshows, document reviews, running meetings, scrum-master stuff, etc. That is totally fine and I get that it’s all a part of the job too, but I’m at a point in my career where I want to be working on building my technical skills, because I’m still pretty early on in my career. I feel like I’m doing only “admin” stuff tbh. Furthermore, there was a pretty big fire recently with our code base (that I also worked on previously) that was so big that it was essentially an “all-hands-on-deck” scenario (no...I wasn’t the cause of it), but I was literally the only software engineer on our team that wasn’t asked to work on it. I even find that when I offer help with technical stuff (like with this fire), everyone is like, “Nah we’re almost done here, thanks tho.” Even though like...10 people have been working weekends and 10 hour days to resolve it. Ig it makes me feel kinda bad cuz it’s like...I know I’m not the most technically sharp person in the world, but surely I know enough to help out here (I’ve literally made some pretty big design updates to the code in the past too, so it’s not like I’m totally useless)?? Basically, I want more technical work. How do I ask for this?

A second concern I had is...my team lead, who I used to be real close to. I notice that in the past couple of months, when I approach with questions (and I have been having a lot because I’m very new to all the scrum stuff), it seems like my team lead gets really short with me and almost...annoyed that I ask questions or ask for guidance to plan things better? I literally get afraid to ask anything now, but it’s like if I don’t ask then I’m more likely to mess something up too, so idk what to do. I’ve also been yelled at during meetings a couple of times by her (and a couple of other senior engineers, after which I get words of “sympathy” from other people on my team). I get feeling frustrated with colleagues, but don’t yell at me in front of people?? 

Anyways, I feel like I rambled a lot, but I guess I’m asking, what do I do next? 

TLDR: not getting any technical work recently, and unsure how to deal with weird dynamics with teammates"

2050,cscareerquestions,Goldman Sachs or current job,"Hello Reddit, want some advice about whether to take a job offer I have with Goldman Sachs or stay at my current job at Intel.

Me: 
- Masters in CS
- Looking to do MBA and push towards project management track rather than engineering track

My current role: Intel Cloud Solutions Engineer
- 102k base + 10k bonus + 15k stock annually
- Coming up on 6 YOE (4 as intern) on this team
- No costs, I live with parents
- Basically 0 programming, all customer work and some project management

Goldman Sachs offer: Software Engineer 
- 100k base + ? bonus (I hear bonus is good) + relocation
- Associate level programmer with Global Investment Research team
- No stock but will ‘buy out’ the rest of my Intel stock and match vesting schedule (~30k value)
- Dallas, Texas. Would have preferred NY, will have to rent or buy

I guess GS has fancy prestige and I probably should be looking to jump jobs sooner rather than later unless I want to become a lifer at Intel and sleep in my childhood bedroom until I’m middle aged. But I could just jump to an Intel Bay Area programming role for more money anytime I want. In terms of financials and job position, GS seems somewhat horizontal, but I think I need some 3rd party perspective. For me getting an MBA and doing tech program management is the goal.

I went to a top CS school but I was a slacker in university and my GPA was literally 2.0. I somehow managed to get this job through my friend’s referral and I’ve been doing okay, but my knowledge gaps are embarrassing me. Every day I feel like I’m about to get caught for the fraud that I am. This past year has been my worse performance-wise and my weaknesses are showing more and more. I think one of the reasons I was passed over for this promotion is my very weak understanding of coding fundamentals and poor Java/python/data structure knowledge. I can’t even imagine interviewing somewhere else, I’d definitely fail the tech interviews.

2055,cscareerquestions,Signed offer letter has wrong stipend amount,"Hi there, I am intentionally keeping details sparse but I have a bit of an unusual situation.

Recently I was looking back over it and the offer letter says under compensation ""$X Biweekly"" and under housing stipend ""$Y per pay period"". This seems weird to me as the compensation section seems to suggest that pay periods are biweekly, but that would make the housing stipend double what was offered. Would you bring this up to HR before the internship? And if not, would asking them to honor the contract as stated (assuming they pay the original rate of $Y per month) ruin my chances of a return offer / make enemies in HR?"
2056,cscareerquestions,Is it me or my environment is bit toxic,"I had one year of experience before I started my new current job. So I started working for 3 weeks from home before I had joined the office. (It was not probation period but after we made a deal). After 3 weeks they said your payment days will only be counted from the day you work from office so basically I worked for 3 weeks for free.

I joined office the next month, everything was fine.
I learned there were 3 employees including me. One mobile dev, one senior backend dev and me (jr backend dev). And senior backend Dev worked from home occasionally visiting office if need be.

Then I started working. Senior Dev designed the db schema and I started working on it. I was singlehandedly doing that project. In 15 days I completed 70% of project and rest was delayed because they had to work things out on project scope with the client.

 I ask things on Skype via messages. Not regarding help me solve this bug but questions regarding app and how should I work on it. In our first physical interaction he said you should ask questions if you are unsure as you are the one who will be doing revisions so be sure ( I was impressed).

Then later I asked him about something just to be sure in private chat  He'd say we already talked about this. Then goes on to group chat addressing me just to answer the questions.(basically group chat includes like CEO, me and that senior Dev). So now I feel hesitant to ask the questions.

I have ALOT on my plate. I have to handle backend (which needs constant changes) and APIs which needs revisions as per mobile dev. So I miss a thing or two in hustle and bustle. So when they senior Dev or CEO finds bugs they kinda talk in a way that make me feel dumb. They could have address the same thing in much polite and professional way.

Company has no system. No Trello, no proper schema or design of how things should be. I am using my own private repo to house the project with senior Dev as collaborator. Since I am pushing on my repo daily. I thought it will serve as a document of things I have done.
And senior Dev was in charge of production. And at night CEO said that I need X and Y Changes. I said I have done it and pushed it. Can you ask senior Dev to pull the changes in production then senior Dev said you should have notified me and I should send changes to him so he knows I was like ok my bad I will do it from now on.

Earlier that day he asked me to make documents of API. But I had more important task that needed to be handled ASAP as per mobile dev request. So I couldn't make the documents so I explained him the situation. But he said I should take him seriously.

I know it isn't that bad but I wish I had more open and professional environment."

Why I think this is career related is because most of my degree I did a lot of theory based courses, and I feel like I didn’t get too much practice with coding. I also didn’t get an internship which could have helped in filling that gap. In particular I’d love to learn how to develop software in a professional manner, I’m down for mostly anything because it would help me determine what passion to pursue in software development. 

A little about me, most of my degree I dealt with C and C++ although it’s been a while since I got to code in these languages.

I’ve got plenty of time cause I don’t have a job, I’m a fresh grad and I’m super stoked to receive some professional guidance in software development.

My parents are financially supporting me during this period and I am aggressively addressing both the physical and mental health issues. But my recovery is taking so much longer than I hoped, and I am terrified that I will hit a point where it becomes impossible to enter the field at all because my post-graduation gap is too large for me to get interviews. I am not ambitious and simply want a programming job that will provide me health insurance and enough money to live nearby in an apartment without roommates. I have one cat that I need to support as well.

What are your thoughts on this situation - should I be panicking or making other plans? How long do you think I have left before it becomes insurmountably difficult for me to get a software engineering job?"

But before I got the hackerRank assessment from her, I got a rejection email from amazon no-reply email address. 

I'm kinda bummed out about this since she specifically used these words ""Once done, send me an email and I’ll have our HackerRank assessment sent your way!"" I was kinda hopeful about this position. Should I expect an email from her or should I send something if I don't hear back from her? How frequently does this happen?"

My suggestion is for next 10 year learn all things u get.” I feel it’s kinda good thing only.. but will I be going in right way as software engineer?

2081,cscareerquestions,Do you work on side projects while looking for jobs?,"I just figured for those who are currently unemployed and still spending months looking for a job in the industry, do you have to work on side projects or grind leet codes just to build up your resume. I had worked for two companies before this so had a year or two of experience as SWE. 

I’m not referring to someone who just graduated out of college but rather people who has had worked for one or two or more companies previously. 

I always have a constant anxiety that if I don’t spend the time of the gap to doing any project or code related to the career, it would be career suicide.

Like when an interviewer asks “ what have you been doing in the past 5-6 months, etc”,  I feel like the answer should be “ I have been building a cool website,etc or doing freelance work” 
And any answer other than that would give a bad impression to the interviewer and probably ruled out of the chance of getting the job. 

I get that we should take the advice of this subreddit with a grain of salt considering it doesn’t reflect the actual real world expectation.

Data Science seems interesting but I am unsure if my math skills are as good for it. I have not experimented with any of these specializations except traditional computer science, which has led to regular app dev in software dev. work or web dev. for me. My concern is how math heavy will data science be? I did well in discrete maths but struggled with probs and stats, though I had a very heavy course work at that time so I did not have much time to study on my own. My peers have also been telling me that Info. Assurance is really low level.

2084,cscareerquestions,Undergraduate math major looking to gear myself into a career in CS,[deleted]
2085,cscareerquestions,"24 yo fresh Economics graduate looking to change fields and become a Software Engineer: Should I do a part-time CS Master (2y, 3 months) and look for internships &amp; build projects OR do a 1 year conversion MSc and not have time for projects/internships on the side?","Hey,

I recently graduated with an Economics undergraduate degree, am 24yo, from Hamburg (Germany), and want to pursue a career in SWE. I plan to work in Berlin after completing my studies. I have completed a couple of online courses like Harvard's CS50 and Codecademy am am certain I want to pursue a CS degree.

The way I will go about is by completing a non-consecutuve MSc in Computer Science in the UK. it allows non-cs student with a good quant background to obtain a MSc in CS. These programs usually teach many of the contents that a BSc would, but in a shorter time.

Anyways, my dilemma is that in spite of the current COVID situation, I don't know whether I should pursue an online MSc and move to Berlin where I have lots of friends, or move to the UK and start an on-campus degree in September and move to Berlin afterwards. The main issue is the difference in time to complete.

The online degrees can only be done part-time (2 years, 3 months), while the on-campus degree would only take 1 year for the same material.

**Option 1: Do part-time online CS master from May 2021 - Aug 2023**

One the one hand I feel like taking 2 years, 3months is not a bad thing per-se because I am coming from a completely unrelated discipline and I could build up my portfolio with side projects, visiting Hackathons or other conventions, and looking for internships during my studies. However, I don’t know if I  can even get an internship without experience in SWE. The workload for the degree would be pretty low (12-15h a week) so I would somehow have to make up for it with side projects and internships. I would also have more time to build connections etc in Berlin, which is somewhat convenient because I plan to work here after my studies anyways.

On the other hand, It is a pretty long time and I could probably also land a junior position after finishing the degree in 1 year (Sep 2021 - Sep 2022) and for the 2y option it is crucial that I land internships.

**Option 2: Full time CS master Sep 2021 - Oct 2022 and move to UK**

If I choose this route, I would probably just spend the time until Sep with pre-studying for the course. I would take the course at UCL London and people tell me the workload of these 1 year CS degrees is absolutely insane (9-12h a day). The professors specifically advice not to do anything on the side like build own apps or work. So I would basically go in , do a 1 year degree and have a MSc but not have any relevant work experience in the field. I would however have some projects on my portfolio (The ones i completed during the course).  Another issue is that I have no guarantee that in-person teaching will take place in Sep 2021. In the worst case scenario I would move to London just to sit in my room and watch online lectures.

After my studies, I would then move back to Berlin and try to land a junior developer position. Overall,  I would be done approx. 11 months earlier compared to the part time Online degree.

**The programs are:**

* **UCL**: 31.2k£, start in Sep. 2021 and take 1 year (full-time degree)  [Link to degree](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/prospective-students/graduate/taught-degrees/computer-science-msc)
* **Bath (online)**: 13k £ , start May 2021 and take 2y, 3months. (half-time degree) [Link to degree](https://online.bath.ac.uk/online-courses/msc-computer-science)

Reputation wise, UCL is a bit better.

**So:**

Is it worth it to choose the 1 year degree to be done 10-11 months earlier, or should I take my time transitioning into the field?

I would greatly appreciate some advice."

2088,cscareerquestions,Finishing my computer engineering degree in 2 years or something else a year earlier to start my career?,"Hey all, I'm currently a student studying for computer engineering at UTD. I've had a difficult college life and switched schools several times, so after this semester I'll be sitting right around 120 credit hours, enough for a bachelors degree. Because of the prereqs, I won't be able to complete my compE degree until December 2022, but I could switch majors and complete a degree in Cognitive Science by December of this year.

I'm leaning towards Cognitive Science because it does interest me and I already meet nearly all of the computer science requirements for it. At UTD, my concentration would be AI/Machine Learning and Human-Computer Interaction.

I've been in college for so long (6 years, with gaps) that I really just want to get out and start my career. I've had a part-time software engineering internship for over 3 years now and have a pretty decent resume with C/C++, Objective-C, Swift, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL. I am confident in my abilities to write software and have some pretty cool projects I could talk about in an interview. I also have some friends I went to school with who work at some pretty big tech companies that would be more than happy to recommend me. I also have an AS in Electrical Engineering from my community college.

I want to graduate, but I'm worried that getting anything other than a comp sci or computer engineering degree will make it more difficult for me to even make it to an interview. I know I could get a job at my current internship regardless, but it's been my only tech job and I would like to explore other places.

So, if you were in my position, would you stick it out for the next two years to finish the computer engineering degree or simply just get out of school with a degree and start your career?"
2089,cscareerquestions,Lateral Move vs. Potential Promotion,"So here's the situation, I've been working with the same kind of tech for a few years now (started right after college). The tech is a a third party software, that still requires some coding, but usually not a whole lot. I sometimes interview for other internal positions around my company just to keep my interview skills sharp. Well, I happened to get an offer for a fun team that's using very cool front-end tech that could be beneficial for my career in the long run. 

However, in my current position, I'm a high performer and slated for a promotion. I have a lot of connections with my current position now, and by taking the lateral I'd basically ""start from scratch"", but the tech that the other job is offering interests me way more. My current job is aware of my other offer, and are preparing to counter it to make me stay, but that means I'll be still working on the same tech I'm trying to get out of.

What do you guys think? Take the exciting new lateral offer, but work your way up again, or stay working with the same technology but get a promotion?"
2090,cscareerquestions,Do I really need to learn front end web development?,"I’m a student in my third year of college and I have started to learn tools and frameworks to bolster my skill. I have been fascinated enough to explore new languages and their intricacies and it’s been fun. But when it comes to front end web development, that interest just takes a huge dive.

I can’t really put my hand on why I don’t like front end web development. I believe that just working primarily with markup languages isn’t something I’d enjoy doing in my work. I know it is critical to learn because that’s what users interact with and if not good, it doesn’t matter how good the back end is.

I have other interests like learning backend tools and frameworks, API design, database management and dev ops and I am just wondering if I could just focus on my interest and just focus less on front end.


The issue is I would like to be the glorified full stack dev but honestly I would hate to do front end on a daily basis.

So do I learn it anyways?"

2092,cscareerquestions,Is a 135k CHF offer in Zurich actually 8.5k net CHF/month?," Hello everyone,

I'm at the team matching phase of the recruitment process with an upcoming call on Monday.

I was looking at salaries all around Europe and I was surprised by the salaries in Zurich. According to [levels.fyi](https://www.levels.fyi/company/Google/salaries/Software-Engineer/L3/Switzerland/) the total compensation for an L3 in Zurich is around 175k with 134k gross base salary.

After some quick research I found:

* A net pay of 102k CHF/year (8500 CHF/month) according to [ethz.ch](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/working-teaching-and-research/welcome-center/services-and-downloads/salary-calculator.html) and [ch.talent.com](https://ch.talent.com/en/tax-calculator?salary=134000&amp;from=year&amp;region=Zurich).
* An average cost of life of 1500 CHF/month + 2000 CHF/month of average rent according to [numbeo.com](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Zurich) (not sure where to get more accurate info).

This translates to a 5000 CHF/month of savings. Of course the ""cost"" part varies a lot depending on your lifestyle, expecially the rent.

I was quite amazed on the amount of money you could save, but I'm not sure about hidden costs or something I didn't considered.

I live in Italy where healthcare is free and retirement is included in the taxes you pay, whereas in the US everything is left to be managed by you.

Swizerland seems to be in the middle of the two type of systems, but it's not really clear to me how I should account it.

Is there somebody living in Switzerland which can help me with some insights?

Thanks in advance!"

2094,cscareerquestions,Career Advice - QA Automation Engineer or Full Stack Developer?,"**A quick history**

I pursued a mid-career switch and did the Software Engineering Immersive from General Assembly (Singapore). I now have two jobs offers and would like some advice or insights as to which to choose.

*(I'll try to ask more dev related questions, as I don't think the other factors like travelling to work or pay is relevant here. For this argument, let's just assume ceteris paribus)*

# Full Stack

I definitely enjoy building. I can't really say which I prefer - front or back end. But designing the systems and implementing them is always a challenge I look forwards to. I understand I'm pretty new to web dev and am willing to learn.

# QA

To be honest this would be very very new to me. I understand development is way more than just full-stack/front/back, and I think this role would give me some exposure to the bigger picture of development  


# Helpful Advice Needed

* Advice by any existing QA engineers on how you feel about your role will be insightful
* How likely is it that I can move back to a full-stack/front/back end role should I decide I want to leave QA?
* I'm also wondering about career specialisation and how 'fixed' I'll be in either sector. And would moving from one to the other impact my career progression?

Many thanks in advanced!"

I'm enrolled in OMSCS through Georgia Tech while working as a mechanical engineer.

A few questions:

1. What should I do with my resume? I've worked for large companies such as General Electric, which I believe helps my chances of landing a job at an established company... however my focus at these large companies wasn't at all related to computer science. My most recent role was ""Region Lead"" for a testing team. Am I better off changing the body of my resume to show projects I've done on the side and have the companies I worked for/what I did as a footnote?
2. What additional certifications should I get outside of my classes, and what else should I be focused on? I've been looking at AWS/Azure/GCP since it seems like everyone is looking for cloud computing experience.
3. Should I target energy companies since my background is primarily energy/power plant related or does it not really matter? While I have a lot of experience in energy, I don't necessarily want to stay in that field. However if it helps me land my first software engineering job then I'll target my focus.
4. At what point should I start looking for software engineering jobs to be competitive? My current job pays well and it'll likely be a lateral/downward move financially.... however I'm just not passionate about it. I'm not in a rush to get a new job, but I don't want to wait forever either.
5. Opinions of startups vs. large established companies specifically as it related to software? I have no experience with startups right now, but my initial thought is that they are highly unstable, pay is lower and you can't count on a paycheck. I'd love some firsthand thoughts on this.

Any suggestions are appreciated!"

I can finish most leetcode medium questions in 30 minutes and some leetcode hard questions if I have seen the problem before.

I've tried meditating before the assessment, but as soon as I finish reading the problem, my mind starts racing.

Funny thing is, I don't usually experience this problem in other high stress situations like test taking or sports. I just can't get comfortable during the assessments and interviews themselves. Does anyone else have this problem? Or have any tips on how to get better at the interviewing process?"

&amp;#x200B;

I am a college grad as of April 2019. I was working as Software Engineer at a decently sized defense company, I really liked it but decided to try a different company due to wanting to try different technologies, culture, and the pay was way better. Aside from that I did not have a really have a personal reason for leaving. So I leave them on good terms, and they were actually genuinely sad I left but understood where and why I left and supported it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have now been working at this new company for a little under 6 months, and I hate every minute of it. They micromanage our every move, and set deadlines that are not that reasonable, and overall just care about themselves and not the employees. I have learned a lot from the little time I'm here but I am worried that leaving would make me look like a job hopper. Where I only worked from April 19-April/May 2020, and now here from April/May 2020 to now, and then the possibility of leaving. Reading company reviews as people leave they have similar experience, but puts me in a difficult situation since Both jobs are relatively short term.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking for advice on what would be best here, do I just try and stick it out? Is it best that I leave (with new job lined up of course), or other options (I dont think they want to change). Will I be pestered much about having two jobs that are short lived? I want to find a place that pays good values their employees, and I can stay awhile but it's hard to relay that when I had 2 short term jobs, especially only 6 months.

Should this all be sufficient?","I thoroughly enjoy working with the Arduino and Raspberry Pi and would like to continue working with both of those devices. I'm aware that I can move on to trying to code the microcontroller directly using an ISP programmer and Atmel studio, but have read that there isn't much point to it other than form factor, as the Arduino and rpi libraries are rather extensive. Is this true, or should I be using an ISP programmer and Atmel studio?

I've done a few basic Arduino projects and have recently just been playing with each individual module and component. I have some project ideas I will be following up on this upcoming week. Would doing projects like an alarm clock and some IoT projects be good for my portfolio? Additionally would it be significantly better to try to do the project entirely myself from scratch, or to do the project with documented reference to others' projects, make my own modifications, fully understand the project and add it to my portfolio? 

I've also got some videogames I've made using both Pygame and Unity. I was thinking I should include these projects as well to show some competency in Python and C# even if only a bit of competence. I have a third game in Unreal Engine but am having some trouble recovering the code... Also the project in Unreal Engine was a group project so if I can recover that code I could show I've got experience working in groups. Am I right in including these games to my portfolio? I should simply be adding everything I can to my portfolio right?

2156,cscareerquestions,Benefits of Transferring to a Top University,"Hello CS Career Questions Community,

I wasn't sure where to ask this question, so I ended up here hoping this is the right place.

Basically I am currently studying Computer Science at a t50 university UC Santa Cruz. While my education is really great, I was lately thinking about going into startups/entrepreneurship and thought about how top schools like UC Berkeley would likely provide me better prospects with the support and programs they have. I also noticed how there are many startups coming out of Stanford/Berkeley, so this would be a great way to meet people and pursue any opportunities that come.

I was wondering if the transition, perhaps if I were to apply and get in, would be worth it from a career standpoint. By the time of a possible transfer (if they even let me in), I would have completed DS &amp; Algorithms and possibly 1-2 upper division courses. However, if I go to Cal I would likely have to redo my lower division requirements with my GEs completed at my previous institution and get a 3.3 minimum GPA. There will definitely be much more pressure and possibly rigor considering the grade deflation at Berkeley.

To be more specific, what benefits does studying at a much more known university bring in terms of startup related careers/entrepreneurship. In addition, if I find myself not enjoying this focus, would Berkeley provide me much of an edge over my current institution? I'm currently a first-year student and legit don't even know so I figured I could ask here.

Anyways, thanks so much for your time and wisdom."

2158,cscareerquestions,Codility and HackerRank programming problems are crushing my confidence,"Professional programmer for about 5 years and have seen promotions and great reviews from my colleagues, mentors, and bosses. Have done things like solved database deadlocks, mitigated query bottlenecks, introduced concurrency to teams that didn't know about it, brought solutions into the cloud (with pipelines, machine swaps, key vaults, severless, etc) - and yet when I come across these Codility and HackerRank interviews, it makes me feel like all of the hours I've put in to becoming a better software engineer are for nothing because I'm absolute shit.

Even as a child, despite my strengths being in both reading comprehension and math, I **hated,** and sucked, at brain teasers. But I didn't just dislike them because I sucked - I disliked them because they were always so, ""Gotcha!"" in their answers. ""Should have tried turning the peg around 4.5 times to the right, 1.24 times to the left, spinning yourself in a circle, and then eating a banana - that was the trick. Gotcha!""

I never felt this way in my algorithm courses, and I passed them (with A's) with fond memories - I minored in maths too. But no matter how many times I read, ""Cracking the Coding Interview"" or study CLRS Algorithms, these Codility and HackerRank problems are a total wash. Either a third of the time I pass it because I've seen it before, the other third I pass on correctness and fail on performance, or the last third I fail because I ran out of time looking for ""the trick"" that solves the performance problem and then get told by the recruiter, ""There was no trick. Could have done this in the 75 min we assigned you"".

I'm in the top 10% on Stack Overflow and top 8% on Software Engineering. I'm in the top 5% on LinkedIn and Plursight exams for tests I take in my domain and although it's not amazing, I did graduate with a 3.4 so I didnt completely slack, and I teach CS in my free time as part of a non-profit because I really do love this field.

I'm currently in university studying CS and sustained an injury last semester which impedes me from working on a PC for a long time (especially typing which is kinda essential to programming). I'm working on fixing it also look for alternatives like programming with my voice and so on but it got me thinking. Programming in and of itself was never something I truly enjoyed, it was always more a mean to an end since I enjoy planning and seeing my creation way more than the act of typing itself. Furthermore I'm not sure anymore if I want to sit all day in front of a PC because nowadays I don't feel as comfortable sitting in front of screen all day like I used to but I would still very much like to work with my brain but in the 21 century I don't see that working outside a very computerized environment.

2170,cscareerquestions,Do I have what it takes to become a Data Engineer?,"**First of all, sorry for the long post.**

I'm a chemical engineer and I currently work as a ""graduate analyst"" at a non-tech company. During the time I've been working at this company, I discovered that I love DE and I would like to shift my career towards it instead of chemical engineering. The problem is that since I'm the only person doing this type of job at my company, I don't have anyone to compare myself to, so I don't know if I have what I need to become a DE.

Also, I don't have any formal IT education.. I've learned everything on my own by reading documentation, watching videos, etc. So this gives me more insecurities about my knowledge (as far as I know, I might be doing everything wrong and I don't have a way to tell).

**I would say that this are my DE skills:**

\- I'm very comfortable with python, I've been doing random things as a hobbie for quite a long time

\- I know some SQL, nothing super crazy but I get the job done (I google 95% of what I do)

\- Very comfortable with Excel

\- I can create simple PowerBi reports

\- I'm not a linux expert but I get the job done

\- SQL Server/Azure SQL, again, no expert but I get the job done by googling and some trial and error

**Some of the DE related things that I've done so far are:**

**1-** At this company, they receive data from two different sources, the first is a lot of emails with attached files (xlsx, xml, html, csv, etc). This files need to get converted to Excel spreadsheets so that an industry-specific software can read them and load them into a database. The classification, download and transformation of the emails and attachments used to be done with Outlook + VBA scripts (the VBA scripts would interact with Excel and they were CONSTANTLY crashing and having issues). What I did is I replaced this with a python program that I built (it connects directly to the email using the O365 package and does all the transformations and classifications without interacting with excel or Outlook), you can see the program here: [https://github.com/devgio/carpincho](https://github.com/devgio/carpincho)

**2-** Replaced the industry-specific ETL software (about 30k a year for the licence, not including SQL Server) with Azure SQL + Blob storage + a VM running Airflow. I designed the database, created the dags and set up everything. This is loading \~1M records a day and it's what we use for almos all our data needs.

To do this I learnt a lot about linux (I cconfigured Airflow from scratch, I created services for Airflow and the email processing program, etc)

This change was VERY positive, and reduced the annual cost by about 80% and the reliability of the system is much much better now.

**3-** All the reports used to be done using interconnected Excel spreadsheets. I replaced all of them with either PowerBi reports or Excel spreadsheets connected only to the Azure SQL database. This reduced the number of errors and the time to build the reports.

**4-** Referencing item 1, the second data source is a data historian in a remote off-shore platform. The connection with this historian is terrible and we lost a lot of data because of it. I reconfigured the data historian server to drop the data into csv files instead, and when the connection allows, the csv files are pushed to Azure blob storage to then be loaded into the Azure SQL database.

Are this tasked that a DE usually does? I really like doing this and I'm thinking about looking a job at a tech company. What do you guys think?

Also, any recommendation on technologies or concepts to focus on will be highly appreciated!

Thanks!"
2171,cscareerquestions,"Revature: A comprehensive, no BS review","Hello all. From my experience, there is a lot of unclear, mixed, and odd information on Revature online, specifically on this subreddit. I am going to write this review of Revature (my experience thus far) in attempt to publicly clear some of it up. I hope this will benefit some of you. The following two paragraphs will be an introduction to what Revature does; skip them if you are already familiar.

**WHAT IS REVATURE?**

What is Revature? Revature is a sort of hybrid combination of employment agency and software engineering/coding bootcamp. It is marketed as the bridge between the infamous “2+ years experience” requirement you see on “entry level” jobs and people without said experience. Revature is not the only company that does this; there are others like them. FDM Group is one I can name off the top of my head. But Revature undoubtedly is the most well-known, likely because they have somehow managed to post job listings on nearly every job board in seemingly every city in the US. And guess what those listings are titled? Yep, “entry level software engineer. No experience needed!”

They have recruiters who guide you through easy little entry interviews to get you signed up for a training start date. These trainings usually take place on a few college campuses, I *think* mostly in the East and South US. Florida, Virginia, West Virginia, Texas.  *As of writing, all of the trainings are happening remotely due to the pandemic; mine was remote*. If you do not have much experience with coding, they will tell you that you have to do a 2-4 week online live class called Spark, and this training is completely unpaid and contract free. After you pass that, you can qualify for one of the bootcamp trainings, during which you get 10 days contract free and then are told you have to sign to continue. After training, you go to a staging phase where Revature works to find you positions with various companies and get your interviewed for them. These companies are almost entirely massive companies, a lot of Fortune 500s. Revature then pays you 45k (more if in high COL) your first year of work, and then 55k your second year of work (also more if high COL). They then will offer you a third year contract free if you want, and that’s 75k salary. You are offered a small stipend to help cover moving costs when moving to on-site training and job sites.

In short, Revature trains people (a \~3 month bootcamp) in various techs and then contracts them out to companies to work for 2 years. And you’re paid for the entire experience. They really do this; it’s not a scam. But there are some catches and some sketchy things that I will address.

**THE CONTROVERSIAL THINGS**

It mostly sounds marvelous, right? What’s the catch? The *big* one you’ve probably already heard of is the contract and how it works. The contract has all these little conditions you aren’t supposed to break, the main one being that you can’t just up and leave once you’ve signed their contract. If you do break the contract, they say you will be charged with a whopping 46k. It used to be less and they recently have increased this.  

Another catch is that you are basically paid minimum wage until you actually start a job for whatever company they contract you out to. That means that during the bootcamp and the staging phase (which usually ranges anywhere between 1-3 months), you will make very little. And on top of that, your 2 year clock on the contract doesn’t start until your first day with a client. This means training and staging time does not count towards that 2 years, even though you’re still locked in at that point.

Perhaps the worst catch of all is what I see as the Revature nightmare situation. This has to do with a mixture of being locked into that contract and being moved around geographically. Technically, the clients you are contracted out to are often bringing you on for big projects. Rarely, someone will reach completion of the project and the company will then say “k, we’re done with you then” and send you back to Revature, where you are placed back in the staging phase where you will again make minimum wage. That is, until they find you another company to go work for or until you’ve been in staging for \~3 months (and they then let you go penalty-free).  You could also get sent back if the client doesn’t like you, but you have to be a big underperformer or do something bad for this to occur otherwise Revature will fight for you to keep you in your position.  But during non-pandemic times, this literally means you would have to move from your training site where you are in staging, to the job site where your client is located, and then back to the training site again when they are done with you. Yes, you can a small stipend to help cover moving costs, but Revature doesn’t give a damn if you have to break leases or eat big costs for long-term stays at Airbnbs. With Revature you have to be light on your feet, and you could be sent across the country at a week’s notice. There’s a lot of geographic unknown.  And who knows, maybe they are more reasonable with this than I’m giving them credit for.  I never personally spoke with anyone who went through this, I just know it is possible in theory.  In most cases, you go to your project and you stay there the whole time, problem free.

The pay is also, without a doubt, fairly low.  People also rage about this.  Being a software engineer getting paid 45k isn’t wonderful, but it’s just for one year, and it’s enough to live off of.  The value of Revature isn’t the salary, it’s the resume building and the increase of the future value of your salary.  Maybe you can go get a job making 60k for the next 4 years, or maybe Revature will pay you 45k for year 1, 55k for year 2, and then you go land a job making 100k afterward.  Maybe not, who knows, but you get what I’m saying here.  Be real with yourself and consider how much you’d be missing out on if you didn’t do Revature.  If you’re like me, you wouldn’t be missing out on anything.

Lastly, I’ll mention that you don’t usually get to pick what tech you are trained in.  I had no idea what I would be trained in until day 1 of my paid training.  Some people I spoke with mentioned that their recruiter gave them a choice.  Mine didn’t, but it worked out fine.  Revature is only training people in tech that they believe employers see as marketable, otherwise they can’t sell you to them.  This is how Revature works for you, and they’re looking out for you during that entire 2 years because they win when you win.

So that’s the bad. When you hear people badmouthing Revature, they usually stop here.  But let me tell you: for me and man others, the good far outweighs the bad. *Virtually no one gets stuck with the contract breakage fee, even people who actually break the contract*. I think it’s obvious as to why. The contract is, to a degree, a scare tactic that has to be in place for Revature’s business to be possible, otherwise people would take their paid training and then scoot off to do their own thing. But they are transparent about it, they went over the contract with us many times, and we all knew what we were getting into. Sure, in a perfect world that breakage fee wouldn’t be there, but if you just don’t break the contract, there’s never going to be any issue at all. If something does happen like they can’t find you a job, they literally will just tear your contract in two and say “you’re free to go.” They do not try to stick people with it, it’s just meant to keep people on their track for 2 years and that’s it. I know of absolutely no one who has gotten threatened or stuck with the fee.

The minimum wage thing is often blown **WAY** out of proportion too. People rage about how Revature is so awful for paying you minimum wage, but you have to remember that *you are literally being paid to learn.* Imagine if you had gotten paid to go take college CS courses, wouldn’t that be great? Instead, you had to pay out of your butt for tuition. Bootcamps are like this too, usually! You pay a massive 10k+ sum of money and just hope that what you got taught will land you a job. With Revature, not only do you not have to pay a fat sum of cash, you will actually *make* cash while learning, and it puts the incentive on them to ensure that they are teaching you stuff that will actually make YOU money and land YOU jobs, because they have to sell you. And besides, you’re only going to be paid minimum wage for a few months. That is extremely short term, and then you begin to make a living wage. The bootcamp and staging pay is just meant to allow you to not go into debt and to put food on the table until you get to the actual job.

**MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE**

I do not have a computer science degree.  I majored in business and had little to no coding experience previously, just some experience with VBA when messing around with Excel and maybe like 2 hours experience with Javascript.  I had to do their initial 4 month unpaid class and that just solidified for me how much I liked doing this stuff.  I started getting into Revature right as the pandemic was getting bad so I had a few bumps concerning that, but in the end, Revature trained me in a fantastic, relevant, modern tech that I love doing.  I pretty quickly went from training to getting a real software engineering job with a real tech company, even without a CS degree.  I’m a couple months into my project/actual job now and I’m really liking it.  Coworkers are great and the job is going to look great on my resume.  And on top of all this, I now have a network of bright blooming software engineers from my training batch.  They’re going to all kinds of companies and I keep in touch with them.  Teaching myself would not have given me this.

During training, I was working extremely hard and at most was doing like 15 hour days.  Definitely worked weekends, though they aren’t paid.  However, later in the training, my work hours plummeted and I would sometimes only be working for 4 hours a day.  Note that you’re paid for that 8 hours a day, nothing more nothing less.  The training varies based on your trainer and how he or she wants to do things.  Mine liked to lecture for around half the day and then leave the rest of the day open for us to do some self teaching and to experiment and work on projects.  I liked this approach, as our trainer was still completely open and available for questions and consultation even after releasing us.  Think of training like it is a very full college semester, except you’re getting paid for it.

Revature WILL release you if you do not perform well in training, but they won’t make you pay the fee.  It’s not all hand holding either, so you really have to keep your head down and focus and work hard during that training.  The people in my batch who were already software engineers found the training to be easy overall, whereas people like myself found it to be hard.  It varies between people.  It was challenging doing it 100% remote, but you get used to it after a while and start to appreciate it too.

During staging, you’re “supposed” to be working for 8 hours a day to practice on your own and stuff, but most everyone just slacks off and collects the 8 hours of pay while they wait for interviews.  Just how it is.   

And then after that, it’s just the job for the next 2 years!  This is when you finally get paid the living wage.  You hardly even interact with Revature at this point, they just pay you.

**BOTTOM LINE**

Revature is a great opportunity if you’re like me and want to get into the tech field and don’t have a CS degree and you can manage possibly having to work on the other side of the country. It has its downsides like every job does and Revature has a lot it needs to improve, but none of these cons are enough to lead me to tell you to avoid it. If you already have a CS degree, I don’t really know why you’d be trying to get into Revature. Many of my fellow trainees are not as happy with Revature as I am because they didn’t get nearly as much out of training, *because they already knew how to do most of what we were taught*. They are extremely overqualified. If you have your CS degree, pick a marketable tech and do your own projects and push them to GitHub. Apply to jobs everywhere. Otherwise, if you’re fine with making a bit less for a measly 2 years, then yes, Revature will be a fine option to get you over that entry-level job hump that we all dread.

I'll be glad to speak on anything you have questions about.  Drop me a comment and I'll respond.

And finally, *if you found this review helpful and are going to sign up for Revature,* I do have a referral link that will yield me a bonus. You don’t have to use it, and I’m not making this review to advertise it, but I’d greatly appreciate it if you did and it would be a great way to thank me. If you’ve already signed up, I’d appreciate it if you asked your recruiter if you could apply the referral link to your profile nonetheless.  I'd prefer to not leave it out here publicly though, and will provide it to you via DM if interested."

2173,cscareerquestions,Predictive Text &amp; Correcting Grammar Mistakes,"My Goal is to take the words in the dictionary &amp; attribute them to x amount of groups. Each of the groups has its own words &amp; sub-groups based on a shared characteristic  


The problem that I'm having is when a specific group is chosen &amp; the contents (i.e. the other sub-groups) are chosen the output reveals poor grammar. I have to manually adjust the word so it fits correctly and this is annoying. Is there a way I can get proper grammar structure from a randomly generated combination of words? Is it possible to organize these words in a proper sentence based on ""Parts of Speech"" (i.e Adjectives, Adverbs, Conjunctions, Determiners, Nouns, Prepositions, Pronouns &amp; Verbs)  


Here's an Example: 

 BAD SENTENCE STRUCTURE  
Group 1        Group 3                Group 8  
I AM            Extremist (noun)        Annoy (verb)  


GOOD SENTENCE STRUCTURE  
Group 1        Group 3                    Group 8  
I AM            Extremely (adverb)        Annoying (adjective) 

&amp;#x200B;

It seems I need to properly deconstruct the language into atomic bits first. ""I AM"" fulfills the ""subject/noun ('I') - verb ('be')"" part which would be the most simple sentence structure in English. The next nouns would usually be objects (accusative case). Freely jumbling between nouns, verbs, and adjectives may seem intuitive because English likes to recycle words without changing anything (check out [Declension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declension) and [Nominalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalization), for instance). However, they are completely different phrases in terms of grammar, so I'd first have to get the framework right (see [Grammar/Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar#Theoretical_frameworks) and [Constituency relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar#Constituency_relation)).

I have DS and web scraping and Python experience, but my undergrad was in Mechanical Engineering and my Master's is in Systems Engineering and Data Analytics, so I never learned CS Fundamentals. I am fairly good at Python and I've used many components of DS&amp;A without knowing what I was doing was called (Example: using graph data structures and recursion without knowing that's what they are). Of the people that have been in the 2 year program I'm joining, most of the Data Engineers become Software Engineers at the end of the program (it is a software heavy leaning Data Engineering position and far from an SQL monkey role-- company's tech department only started hiring Data Engineers a few years ago). I want to prepare myself for a potential transition to a SWE role and I want to learn the fundamentals to expand my knowledge and so I don't make a fool of myself by not understanding terminology.

2176,cscareerquestions,"Laid off about 6 months ago, after only having about 1.5 years of experience. Now can't get hired for a job. Feel like I have fallen through a crack in this industry and don't know how to fix this?","So, basically, I graduated with a CS degree and worked as a developer for about 1.5 years. Before this, I worked in another industry for about 5 years (worked their while paying for my degree). Due to working full time, I couldn't get internship experience because I had to pay for housing and other things with my job.

After graduating, I got hired as a full stack developer. Worked there for about a 1.5 years and got let go mid summer 2020. I took a few months off due to some personal things I wanted to take care of, also got a couple certificates that I thought could help get a job. Also, worked on a major project as well.

Since then, I haven't been able to get a job though since I have recently started reapplying (started again in early October/November). I have had my resume looked over by people in the industry and they say it looks fine, so it is not an issue with my resume.

I am studying leetcode and working on projects, so I have that covered. Also, 1.5 years of full stack development experience should count for something I would think.

But, it is extremely hard to even get an interview. Again, YES, I have had my resume looked over...it is not that.

I feel like I am just in this odd position right now. I am no longer considered a ""new grad"", so I no longer qualify for those ""new grad"" jobs (yes, the ads specifically say they only want people who graduate between a certain period to apply for those jobs and auto reject if you don't meet that criteria). Yes, I have even tried anyway and got auto rejected as I predicted.

But, I also don't have that magical ""3 years"" experience to be considered a experienced developer, so I get rejected from those due to not enough experience or match.

WTF am I supposed to do, just go homeless at this point? I'm sorry I was the person who got let go because I was newest on the team and they made cuts due to the economy. 

What is someone like me supposed to do to get a job? I'm just at a lose at this point."

2178,cscareerquestions,New grad offered tech founder role at small startup,"**Background:**

I'm currently in my last year of my undergraduate Computer Engineering degree, and I've been working remotely at a *very* small startup for the last \~6 months or so. There's only &lt; 5 people working for the company (all technically contracted, including myself). I am the only software engineer and have built everything myself. The product is a web application that essentially acts as a lead generation tool where the CEO then handles the customer.

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently earning $20/hr (the company is based in HCOL area but I live in a LCOL area) and as previously mentioned I am considered an independent contractor. I know that my work actually constitutes an employee and not a contractor, but as I still live with my parents while I finish up the degree, I was okay temporarily passing up benefits and paying more in taxes to get experience and to build up savings. I work about 30 hours a week, in addition to taking classes full time.

&amp;#x200B;

**The important stuff:**

So recently, I was offered to be the technical cofounder of the company. The equity part is still TBD and would follow the typical four years + 1 year cliff vesting schedule. I was also told that I would probably be paid a bit more (also TBD) and would work full time. He is giving me a couple of weeks to think about it and we'll discuss the hard numbers then.

I am unsure of whether I should stay with the company and be a founder, or if I should join another company once I graduate. I know that being a founder would entail a *lot* of work, and the equity payoff isn't guaranteed, or even likely. I honestly would prefer a job where I don't have to worry about it 24/7, but I'm not opposed to doing this for a year or two. 

Would it be worth it to stay at this small startup as a technical cofounder and have this experience on my resume, or would it be better to take what I already have and apply somewhere else for more compensation? What percent should I expect/ask for if I stay? 

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**

* Am undergrad college student finishing up degree
* Have worked at tiny startup for about 6 months for $20/hour
* Being offered technical cofounder, equity + small raise to be negotiated
* Is it worth it to stay (and what equity should I ask for), or should I go somewhere else to receive higher compensation?"

2191,cscareerquestions,How do people deal with the elitism in cs?,"I feel like I've met a ton of assholes in this field, especially when meeting people outside of my university at a larger school. They are those people who constantly flex that they've been coding since they were 12, who dreams in fucking code and whatnot. As someone who just enjoys programming as a profession and has been fairly successful during my time, it feels like shit whenever someone sees that I'm not going to this school or building my own startup, and ridicules me because I don't actually want to go to a top school or work at FAANG later in my life. I don't care for that life, and I know I should just focus on what I want, but I keep finding the really shitty people out of the bunch and it's insanely annoying.

I like simplicity, but the constant comments saying, ""Why didn't you just go to Stanford? Why aren't you working there? Did you not get a return offer? Why aren't you working in Silicon Valley?"" is so fucking annoying. Just because I don't enjoy silicon valley or like the whole ""large college feel"" doesn't make me ""boring"" or ""in denial"", right? Just because I went to a smaller school, doesn't mean I'm salty and got rejected, it means I wanted to go there and saw the benefits of being there instead of the LARGE TOP CS SCHOOLS. 

I'm doing a minor in economics and I interned at a midsize financial branch to grow diversity in my job experience, and it was kind of refreshing. No one I've met so far is elitist who thinks that just because you like a simple life makes you lazy, no one looks down on you for just wanting a simple life on the outskirts of the city; close enough to reap the benefits of living in the city (like 24/hr food), yet far enough where you don't need to deal with the annoying stuff that comes with city-life. It's nice, and I've been really aching to switch professions at this point. 

It really sucks because I love programming, but meeting other cs students from schools, really makes me want to just quit, and do econ fully. I know I'm generalizing a lot and I know it's not the majority, but it's just really hard to continue on this path."

# About Me

I graduated from UCSD with a BS in Math-Computer Science. I worked on campus as a student developer from the end of my freshman year until I graduated. I graduated with no student loans as I was on full financial aid, worked full time in the summers and part time during the school year. I had one loan initially, but paid it off with my housing stipend from my internship. I got my internship at Amazon the summer going into my senior year and received a return offer. While I had interviews for full time positions, I didn't get offers from any other places.

After graduating I used the money I saved from my internship to backpack Europe from mid January to early March. 9 countries in 45 days. I 100% recommend that everyone do this if they get the opportunity.

I currently live in Seattle with a roommate. Even if we weren't in ""challenging times"" I still wouldn't go out much so I'm not really saving more money than normal when it comes to those types of things. I have a pretty low standard of living so I don't really care about my living arrangement as long as I'm aware of everything from the start and it's cheap. I'm trying to keep it this way as long as possible to avoid lifestyle creep.

# Goals - 2020

I didn't have anything in particular that I wanted to achieve financially in 2020. It was my first ever year actually having money. I did a lot of research on what I should do with my money since I could finally start saving. I kept reading the same advice everywhere I went: make a nestegg, pay off debt, max 401k, invest in low cost ETFs.

I used part of my signing bonus to save $10,000 as a 6 month nestegg in case if something happened. I didn't have any debt so that part is done. I took out the amount of my paycheck to max my 401k by the end of the year. I did a lot more research about investing. After reading the same things everywhere I went, I started putting all of my money into low cost ETFs. I ended up getting rid of my savings account. The interest on it dropped too low and I felt that my money would be better invested. I also pay off my credit card in full every month so I don't have any reason to keep an extra account with unused money, that's what my nestegg is for.

I didn't have a specific percentage to save or anything fancy like that. I just live frugally and throw all my extra money into stonks.

# Goals - 2021

I think I would like to move into a 1b/1b apartment. With these ""challenging times"" apartment prices are getting lower and I'm lucky to be financially well off enough to take advantage of this. I've never lived by myself before and I think I would like to. I plan to live and save like I do now. No specific amounts or percentages, just live way below my means and avoid lifestyle creep. I do have this goal to get a net worth of $1M by 30, but that's way down the road and we'll see what happens.

The pandemic is probably contributing to this a bit. I also turned 21 a little before I graduated, but I've spent a lot on alcohol (Washington liquor tax definitely doesn't help) and I don't like it. It took a sizable chunk out of my wallet and added it to my weight. I noticed it started becoming a bit of a problem, but that's one of my main personal goals to work on next year. :)

I grew up in a poor household. Having money like I do now was strange at first, but I didn't make any radical lifestyle shifts as a result of it. I'm now less worried about prices when grocery shopping and I'm also paying for a whole bedroom, but outside of that I'm not really splurging much and I have no desire to. My quality of life is better than before, and I'm mostly happy where it is, but I'm trying to hold off lifestyle creep as much as possible while playing the long game financially.

# General Takeaways

I hope seeing this is helpful for you. I understand that I'm very fortunate where I ended up so I'm not going to go around saying ""FAANG or bust"" or that my situation is the standard, but I hope this provides some clarity about anything and that you can take something from it. If you have any questions feel free ask away!

# Things to Note

* Numbers might be slightly off, I'm not a computer.
* I started tracking net worth in July.
* The dental expenses are for 4 fillings, a replacement crown and a new crown. Brush and floss your teeth kids.
* I'm currently writing this from a hotel. I haven't slept in my own bed in 2 months because my apartment has been getting repairs. I am hopefully getting a rent reduction and food reimbursed since I don't have a kitchenette. Those numbers are up in the air and that explains why some numbers are very different than the previous months."
2194,cscareerquestions,What technology to learn next?,"I'm still in University, and working part-time as a Unity programmer. I have around an hour of free time that I want to dedicate to learning new technologies, hoping to become more marketable and land an internship later. I also want to explore multiple fields to know exactly what career path will suit me best.

Anyway. I thought learning backend would be a pretty logical thing to do, as I already know some frontend (and I don't love it tbh), and it seems to make for a pretty significant portion of SWEs out there. Okay, cool. But what language/framework?

I read multiple articles along the lines of ""best backend languages to learn in 2020"", and what surprised me a bit is that .NET seems to be extremely niche. Is it? C# is my favorite language so far, so I was looking forward to learning .NET 5. I also know Java, though, and already worked on an Apache Tomcat server before, so there's that. I also know Javascript but I'm not a huge fan.

I don't know, I guess I'm just lost. Is .NET 5 worth getting into? Or am I way better off sticking to the more common stacks? Outside of backend then, any specific career paths that you'd like to recommend? This is gonna sound pretty retarded, but I just don't get the job of a ""Software Engineer"". It's used like an actual job title, so I assume it's a specific role, and not just a generalization? What does a SWE work with then? Software development, sure, but if this software isn't web, cloud, mobile or anything that fits another job title, what is it exactly? I'm having a terrible time grasping my career options as a programmer. I'd love some clarification. What I love about CS is the actual programming, having dozens of classes, logic, algorithms, you know? But I feel like most job opportunities are either moving pixels on a screen or working with databases. Where is the actual programming at? Any recommendations?

Thanks a lot in advance, and happy new year everyone!"

2200,cscareerquestions,17 year old wanting to learn about job market," 

hello there, im 17 in high school and i live near dc. I'm going to college next year for computer science. so for some background info, I've been coding since i was 11. I'm probably like most of you and have always been fascinated with computers. the things I've been coding recently are neural networks, opengl in c++, and I've been making my own programming language in assembly. as u can see most of my skills arent in demand in the job market and mostly require at least an undergraduate degree in computer science/a similar field.

after doing some research, i realized it might be possible for me to get a job/internship as a web developer even without experience or a degree. my main motive is to gain experience for the future and for money because my family is poor, and if i can get a job that is more than 10 dollars an hour like i have right now, that would be amazing. my web dev knowledge is limited to basic html/css/javascript and the LAMP stack. lurking in this subreddit made me realize that the LAMP stack isnt really that popular in the job market right now so I'm currently learning Node Js from Net ninja on youtube. its pretty cool, i really enjoy it. I'm working on a twitter clone with mongodb, since it was the project i made to learn the LAMP stack a couple of years ago.

my question is what are the steps i should take to make my chances in landing a job this summer as high as possible. luckily i have a really good understanding in programming and computers so learning a language or understanding web stuff like HTTP or the DOM isnt that hard for me. I just feel overwhelmed about what to learn and what projects to put on my portfolio, what should be on my resume, etc. im so used to coding and making things for fun i guess i don't really know how to ""sell"" myself. im also 17 so i hope my age wont be a deterrent."

2202,cscareerquestions,Career advice for final year student,"Hey everyone, I am a final year student. I would really like some advice on the following things. Firstly since I transferred from another university to my current university my basics and fundamentals are really weak. That being said I find it really hard to code and solve problems but I do decently well in web development. However I am interested in learning more on machine learning and AI but I am avoiding them because I am scared I won’t be able to do it properly and hence will just go through the course without actually understanding or learning anything because of my weak logic and programming skills.
My parents are pushing me to do masters immediately after my undergrad and they want me to specialise in AI and ML. I personally don’t mind that but I don’t want to enter a field with zero prior knowledge and then end up having regrets and not proactively understanding anything. I wanted to actually work in the industry for sometime but my parents want me to get a masters and then do that.
I am really lost because I want to be able to understand everything rather than just doing courses to pass them and be done with stuff. I am trying to learn from tutorials and all but the more I look at it the term ‘tutorial hell’ does make sense.
I would be grateful for any guidance or advice on any of these topics. Thank you!!"
2203,cscareerquestions,Is this video legit?,"So I am a university student looking to develop my portfolio.

However, I've stumbled across this video

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl5yUEdekEM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl5yUEdekEM)

and one thing they recommended was a sodoku puzzle. I did not do a sodoku puzzle for one of my side projects however it seemed relatively grounded to what I was seeing other people doing on reddit etc.. So I decided to make some projects that took around 1-2 weeks (like a sodoku solver would), and I would say they are kind of within the quality of a sodoku solver.

**TLDR: I'm a recovering heroin addict who went back to school full time to pursue a degree in CS. I completed my first semester fairly well, now I am looking for advice on what to do next.**

I came to this sub over half a year ago looking for advice on getting into computer science, more specifically a 'prestigious university' (lol). After some time, I realized this might've been asking for too much. I managed my expectations and now am attempting to transfer into a decent Cal State or UC school once I finish my general education at community college.

I completed my first semester of CS a couple weeks ago with a 3.7ish GPA. I learned a lot from my intro Java class and came to the conclusion that programming is something I really enjoy. I think being sober is what made a huge difference this time around in trying out CS.  

I've been a bit overwhelmed looking at all the posts about people getting into FANG, scoring all these sweet internships, or building superhuman resumes. My questions is, what should I do next with where I'm at? I really want to try to get an internship this summer if its not too late. I'm not looking for a Big N company either. Literally any company I can intern for so I can began to put experience on my resume early on. I just got cleared by my GM to create an app for our retail company, so that is my first real project I'll be starting on. Hopefully I will be able to create it soon so that I can put it on my resume. 

As of now, this spring I will be taking a second installment of my schools C++ class, an intro to Computer Architecture, Calc 2, and Physics: Mechanics. Fall 2021 I will take Intro to Algorithms and Data Structures. I've read that I will need to know this topic before applying for internships which is why I'm beginning to self learn it. I know I need to add projects to my resume, just not sure what besides the app for my work. Should I learn more languages like Python? Or take courses for web dev, machine learning, or other CS related subjects? 

Thank you in advance to anyone who happens to read this. Happy New Year!"

Ever increasing learning curve of SWEs?
Infor  tdPR12
  20 Comments
Probably a rant but why are we not talking enough about the brutal increasing rate of things which a Software Engineer is required to know/do. Nowadays, the norm is a SE is expected to learn Frontend, Backend, Servers/Cloud, Testing, System Design, Automation, DS/Algos etc. In future(~5-6) years there is a good chance we would be asked to learn AI/ML as well and there would be no need for separate engineers for that. I mean what is expected to learn and do today is atleast a 2 persons job imo.

Its no longer about learning different/newer technologies anymore, its about learning more and more building up psychological pressure upon us to know pretty much everything. They removed/reduced QAs, specialised FE, BE engineers. Now companies are beginning to ask to learn ML as well in addition to conventional software development. What's next, we would be asked also to sell the products too? Or become recruiters because the hiring process is not good enough?

I am annoyed to see this. My argument is that places with manageable learning curve with good support are getting lesser and lesser. Right or wrong?"
2207,cscareerquestions,Making more money as an in-demand niche freelancer,"I’m a 100% remote freelancer who specializes in a certain (in demand) niche/skill.

I spend most of my work *and* leisure time on honing this skill and I have been doing this for years. Suffice it to say I’ve become pretty good at it.

I never network, advertise or initiate contact to prospective clients. Companies usually find my website or Github (and in some cases media appearances, think interviews for tech websites) and then e-mail me and ask if I’m willing to work for them. This alone has produced a steady stream of (satisfied) clients for years.

I’ve worked for wildly different rates over the years, from $50 USD/hour to $100K for a 2 month gig. I almost always agree to whatever rate the client proposes. I love my work (it’s pretty much a video game to me) and I have enough capital to survive 10+ years without work, so I’m usually not very motivated to negotiate rates, and all the more eager to just start working.

Long story short I’m technically competent and productive but a slacker business wise. My resolution for 2021 is to work on the business side to generate more profit. Given that I’m making a good income with barely any effort on the business/PR side, this leads me to think that I could be making much more if just invest in those area’s. Sounds right?

I’d really appreciate receiving any pointers in the right direction. As dumb as it may sound I don’t know how to start networking. I’m not sure how I can catch the attention of companies outside of those who are already finding and e-mailing me. Is cold-calling acceptable? And I don’t know how high I can set my rate without ending up making *less* money in the end.

Keep in mind that I’ve been very active in the open source software scene and a lot of my work is publicly available, and can be used to validate my skills.

PS I don’t want to work for FAANG/Big N or any other company as an employee, even if that would massively increase my income. Remote freelancing is perfect for me."

Happy New Year.

Job Location: India

I've 2.5 years of experience in Python, Computer vision, APIs development etc. During my tenure, I've done few of the projects utilising state of the art models. Now, I think I need to make a switch for better growth. I've recently started appearing for the interviews and from 1-2 of the AI/ML interviews, I realised that employers ask basics which I still need to prepare.

Also, I interviewed for some employers for backend developer and got two offer letters, from which I rejected one because of location and company policies mentioned in the offer letter.

While the first company shared every details with the offer letter, in my recent offer letter, HR didn't share any of the policy and salary breakout beforehand, shared only offer letter disclosing the CTC and DOJ; also stated that I will get the detailed terms and conditions on DOJ and asked for the acceptance and resignation copy thereafter.

I am planning to write some counter questions and ask to the HR along with the copy of the detailed terms and conditions before acting towards acceptance.

All these things kinds of trigger red flags for the company, considering, I've limited experience in job search as I've started it just a month ago. 

Since, this is going to be my first job change after college, I want to make sure, I don't repeat the mistakes which I did earlier.

My current CTC is fairly low considering my experience and the work I've been doing.

I've had words with some of the seniors who says that it's hard to get higher salary later if you didn't get it hiked in the initial years of your career.

I'm in dilema whether 
1. to settle for any other job which pays more than my current employer as later low salary and high expectations are hard to explain to the recruiters and HRs and then just start looking out for new opportunities in next 6-7 months 

OR

2. to prepare more to get some better opportunities as I'm yet to put my 100% in job search and its preparation.

I'd really appreciate if you could share your experiences, expertise or suggestions in taking me the right career decision.

Thanks in advance"

&amp;#x200B;

A summary of what I do have on a resume: I graduated high school when I was 16, did about a year and a half of community college while working as an assistant of sorts at a Law office (worked there for almost 2 years). Then worked for a stint at another law related company, almost 2 years at a generalized testing company as a test proctor, and then a few months as a sale-rep before covid in March. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm only 21, so hence why there isn't a whole lot there. I met my wife a few years ago and she spent 2 years immigrating down here to the US, so I was working full time to support that.  


My main question is, with all of the background Ive given you, what will the job search be like? Can I get offers for newer, or smaller companies to be able to get some experience before I go for the higher paying gigs? Is the market so over saturated that Ill automatically be at the bottom of the work force since I don't have a prior degree of any kind? Just want to make sure we have good chances of getting some work and I can get a job that'll be able to support (for the most part) my wife while she goes to college, before I sign app the paperwork and get started with the program.

2231,cscareerquestions,Possibility of Finding Another Job After the first One,"Hi,

I have recently received an offer for a software engineer techStart position at Liberty Mutual and this is by far the only offer I got (the only interview too). Therefore I decide I may just accept this.

The job will start September this year and I graduate this June. I am attempting to use this job as a stepping stone for 1 -3 years and decide to switch jobs after I have some experience. I might still apply for junior /associate/entry level SDE opportunities. I do this because the job is in Dover and I live in Boston, which commuting kinda sucks.........

But after carefully considering this job, somethings appears as red flags to me and I wish to know how you guys think?

1) I will have a month of training followed by 6 month of developing project with other interns and 6 month of working with a real team on Liberty before I work permanently on the new role. Is this normal for other companies?

2) The HR did not tell me directly which team I would be placed but rather tell me that they will do that after I done my training and they can place me in a team if I desired and if they have a slot open in the team. Sounded like a scam....... is it? I don't know if I will be doing development work? Or if placement in a team is solely base on luck???

3) I went onto linkedin and see the profile of those who had worked as Liberty techStart full time before and some of them are either bootcamp grad or self learner, or graduate with a non well known college. Don't know if that shows anyone who got hired there are not expecting to work on interesting or challenging things but rather work on small feature that real developer don't have time to build. Since most companies do require at least a CS degree or some experience?

In conclusion, base on my finding before, I wish to ask how likely I will be finding another SDE job after working on this one for a few years? Base on my description above, does this sound like a horrible place to work or am I expecting too much from this entry level program for SDE?"

I always wanted to switch careers into a tech related field, but could never do it. I am now thinking I need to switch now.

I’ve looked at OSU, WGU, and Auburn’s online CS degrees. I’ve also looked at some of the boot camps. With my previous background would it be best to go to Auburn/OSU or WGU? Maybe just go for a boot camp?

 I just keep getting the nagging feeling that I’m too old. Is the age hurdle that serious? Sorry to beat a dead horse on the subject, but I really would like some outside guidance. Thanks for any opinions."

2238,cscareerquestions,You don't have to be a Software Engineer with your skills,"I'm posting my experience moving from software engineering to sales engineering because I'm seeing a lot of posts from people who are unhappy with software engineering or even just worried if software engineering is the right career for them; **you don't have to be a software engineer.** 

**TLDR:** Knowing how to code opens the door to many other roles, and many roles would benefit from having someone who knew how to code. I used to be a software engineer, but now I'm having way more fun as a sales engineer. I have friends who became UX/UI, and their frontend development knowledge really helps with prototyping. These are just a few examples of alternative roles. You might not make as much, but you'll be way happier.

I studied computer engineering and then worked full time as a software engineer for 2 years. I loved working on projects in college, but I hated working as a software engineer; I went from working on fun projects where I had a lot of control over the project to mostly maintaining code. It sucked having little say in the projects I was working on. 

A **lot** of my close friends started switching over to client-facing engineering roles; we were always really social, but coding all day wasn't our thing. I left my software engineering role and joined a start-up as a **post-sales engineer** (an engineer focused on supporting a GTM team *after* the prospect signs a deal) at a SaaS startup. 

The pay was the same as my software engineering role, but I only spent about 30% of my day coding. I spent the rest of the day working with customers and collaborating with other post-sales &amp; engineering teams. The work consisted of integrating our product with theirs to troubleshooting our product for a customer. It was refreshing going from coding all day to client-facing communication. 

I left the company and joined as a **pre-sales engineer** (an engineer focused on supporting a GTM team *before* the prospect signs a deal) at another SaaS company recently. Similar to the last role, there isn't lots of coding involved, but this role is focused on convincing prospects that our tool was the right tool for them. Because of that, the role is a lot more flexible and engaging, and I have a lot of control over how I want to tackle each prospect. 

This job is what I loved about college, and I'm glad I was able to find it. I'm hoping those who are discouraged by software engineering take some time to research some other roles that involve coding. My example is just me going to a client-facing engineering role, but I have friends who transitioned to UX/UI design, data science, marketing analytics, sales ops, etc.

For those who are interested in client-facing engineering roles, there are **tons** of different names for the roles, and companies often use the same names for different types of roles (a solutions engineer can be post-sales at one company and pre-sales at another). I'm going to share some names I've seen for these types of roles for you to search up yourself. You can also mix and match a bunch of these words and find similar roles lol.

Of course, you'll need to develop the additional skills to succeed in the role, but you might already have those skills in your belt. For example, if you're outspoken and good at explainging complex concepts to non-technical people, you have what it takes to be a sales engineer.

2243,cscareerquestions,Exploring career paths,"For context, I'm a sophomore computer engineering major expecting to graduate in the spring of 2023, possibly a semester early, but not sure yet.

I currently have 3 main paths in front of me that I find very interesting and I could see myself going into any of them.

- Software engineering 
- IT/Cyber-security 
- Embedded systems or hardware engineering

I understand that these are extremely broad categories themselves, but I think they are good generalizations for what I am thinking of. There are a lot of things in between, but the categories are essentially: developing software, managing or securing computers and networks, and developing hardware and lower-level computing. I went into comp eng because it gives me the opportunity to go into any of them.
These paths are different enough that they have some different skillsets, requirements, and knowledge needed to go into them. The IT/cybersecurity route needs certifications and experience in things like linux, whereas the hardware/embedded systems route needs more computer logic and architecture knowledge and low-level stuff.

Any advice on how I should go about choosing which path to take and what to learn?

I know I like coding and I really enjoyed my programming classes, the one in C was great. I'm currently exploring software dev mainly, learning web development and doing small Javascript projects on my own. I'm also learning linux and a bit cybersec here and there, and I might dive deeper into that world later. I haven't really taken any hardware-focused classes other than the first class on computer organization, so I was going to wait till I get to them higher level classes and electives to really start diving in.

My problem is that I don't want to be stuck not knowing what I want to do come senior year. There's quite the electives list with some classes that could be categorized into the 3 paths I listed, and i have no idea which ones to take, I can only take a few. 

I want to hopefully get internships as early as possible, but I'm not sure what kind of internships to pursue and what skills to build. Since the skillsets are different, it would take a lot of time to build skills in each area, and even then, the things I may learn will only be surface level and maybe not representative of what the work is actually like.

From my understanding, I need skills to get internships during college and jobs after, but if I'm in this limbo not knowing what path to take, I feel as though I can't be focused in pursuing a certain skillset and tailor my resume and skills to that certain career path. I'd kinda be all over the place with barely any skills in any of the three paths. Is it ok to be exploring for a while? To me it feels unproductive not knowing what in doing. I've also heard people tell me ""why are you doing web dev if you're computer engineering?"" To which I have no response other than idk what I really want to do and I'm exploring. External factors and what people say I should or shouldn't go into due to x or y reason might also pressures me. People say hardware is dead, or there's no money in this or that field, which I don't really want to affect my decision because they're all pretty well paying imo.

Any help would be greatly appreciated"

2250,cscareerquestions,Need Advice for Working With a Difficult Senior Engineer,"**TLDR:**  I am a junior software engineer leading the development of a small project. The feedback I get from a specific senior developer is rude and generally unhelpful despite positive feedback from the PM, the users, and helpful, constructive feedback from other senior developers. He has insisted that he needs to review everything I do and goes after me when I try to work independently or with other senior developers, and its really starting to stress me out. I need advice for handling the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started working as a software engineer. It's been mostly good, but I have a lot of difficulty working with one of the senior engineers and I'm really not sure how to handle it. 

The PM said the customer was really happy with the work I've been doing, so he gave me a small microservice-type project to lead independently and with a few interns occasionally.

I still run a majority of the code I write for the microservice by a specific senior developer I worked a lot with in the past for feedback (which I believe the PM expects from me but am unsure). I also really want feedback so I can improve and advance, but what he provides is usually unhelpful. He's told me I don't understand the point of any of the dependencies I'm working with and that everything I do is a hack, or highlighted chunks of code with nothing more than a ""please fix"".

Most of what he says is really passive-aggressive and demeaning like this; I've tried multiple approaches to dealing with this. I've tried explaining my approach to him, but he never agrees with anything I say. I've tried to ask him directly ""How would you suggest I fix this/what would you do to fix this?"" but he usually sidesteps the question by sending me a link to general documentation (that doesn't mention the issue we're discussing), continuing to tell me I don't understand the point and I need to rewrite it, or something equally unactionable like ""please refactor"".

At times, I've gone to other senior developers to ask them about some of his feedback and how I can improve the code, but they often find my solution is reasonable and desirable, and they explain it to the other senior developer. When this happens, his tone usually changes, and he acts like it's a great idea they just had or something he has been suggesting all along, but I haven't understood. I had a short conversation with one of the other senior developers and they thought his behavior was 'weird'.

I usually merge noncritical or small bugfixes without his review. When I do this, he sometimes starts an email thread with everyone I work with and tells me there's major issues that I'm letting through without pointing to anything specific. 

This is particularly frustrating because everything I've heard when speaking to the customer has been positive and the feedback I get from other senior developers is practical and useful. I really don't have a problem with being told something I do is wrong or suboptimal, but it's hard to work with him when he doesn't give me anything specific off of and acts likes this.

I've thought about talking to the PM about it, but I'm not sure if it's worth making an issue out of. I've also considered just ignoring him, but he always goes after me when I act independently, and I don't want to screw something up because I have so little experience. I'm also concerned that this is normal and I'm blowing this way out of proportion but its really starting to stress me out.

Does anyone have any advice or experience dealing with something like this? Thanks."

2252,cscareerquestions,"How should I write about my experience as a ServiceNow developer, when looking for full stack jobs?","I'm a MEng CS student graduating in the summer, and have worked part-time throughout my time at university as a ServiceNow developer at a local company (for 3 years). For those who are unfamiliar with ServiceNow, it is a SAAS architecture that provides IT service management (ITSM). My job is primarily frontend development - I've mainly been using Javascript, HTML &amp; CSS. I've also been working with REST APIs and relational databases. That being said, I would say most of my time is spent clicking through pages and writing very small snippets of code.

As I'm starting to think about what to do when I graduate, I have decided that I want a change away from ServiceNow as I don't want a be stuck as a developer who is only proficient in one platform. Especially as over the past 3 years I have noticed as the ServiceNow platform gets updated, the level of coding developers are required to do is reduced. i.e. Things which I would previously have written code for are being replaced with drag &amp; drops. I feel like this is a waste of my skills.

My two questions are:  
1. How are ServiceNow developers seen by employers when recruiting for a full stack developer position?

2. What key skills that I've picked up from ServiceNow should I focus on 'selling' on my CV when applying for a full stack developer position?

2254,cscareerquestions,How to use January to best prepare for an upcoming job,"tl;dr Starting a software testing job soon. Previous experience is in game testing. How do I use my time to best prepare for this new challenge?

Just before Christmas, I accepted a new job as a software tester. I start in a few weeks. My previous testing experience is in the gaming industry, mainly small browser and app games. This new job, however, will be focussed on continuously developed B2B software that's nothing to do with gaming.

I believe I'm a solid tester in general and a lot of my skills will be transferrable but I'm still a bit uncertain about what exactly will be expected of me and perhaps I have some gaps in my knowledge in terms of what techniques are needed for software testing specifically. I don't want to get too specific but the game testing job, while quite technical in parts, was also quite focussed on game concepts, the UX and how the game looks and feels, etc. I get the impression that that part of the job will be replaced with more technical stuff and more regression testing in this new position. The software testing job will mainly be manual but there will be a little bit of automation to do on the side.

So, with all that in mind, my question is do you have any tips for how I can best use the next few weeks to prepare for this new role and get up to speed? For example, in the software field, I imagine drop down boxes are used a lot and there is probably a rough set of standards on how to test drop down boxes and what edge cases there might be. Things like that.

Ultimately, I just don't want to be caught out early on in terms of my lack experience in non-gaming software and want to use my time before the job as well as possible. Thanks in advance for any help!"

A knowledgeable senior engineer(been there at the company way longer than me) joined my team few months back, he was a bit disgruntled with the company. He used to do certain pranks on certain services/modules/components, initially it was fun but then it got escalated, wherein it was done on a production system causing an outage. I knew about all this, but never came forward as I wanted to steer away from it. But one fine day he was caught.  
The company came to know that I was aware of it way before this, yet didn't come forward even after being asked (I know I am most stupidest person ever and totally deserve this) and hence also investigated me for Misconduct which led to my termination on the basis of lack of Integrity.

Company A would be

* (Positive) One of the top insurance brokers in the world, stability would probably be long
* (Positive) Composed of a team from Germany and they are looking to create a Philippine team - my friend said that lateral movement or going abroad (I'm from the Philippines) is common in this company. The HR and the German Team seems to say that there are many opportunities for the PH team to grow.
* (Negative?) They are using Java with Liferay, and when I looked the marketability of Liferay, it seems like there are few job opportunities looking for this skill - not sure regarding this one. 

Company B would be

* (Positive) They are using Java with Spring Boot
* (Positive) It seems like they value work life balance, not sure with company A
* (Negative) I just finished my final interview with them and they said I passed. Job offer discussion was scheduled for tomorrow but here comes the kicker - the HR called me again to say that they have changes in the company and the team lead that held the technical interview will not be the one I will be working with anymore. So they are requesting for another technical interview with the different team lead I would be working with before the job offer meeting (weird right? And can I say that I was a bit angry lol). Now I checked with my friend and it seems like it was because of a company reorg (shuffling of teams) and that scared me so I asked why they are doing a reorg. It was revealed that they had little income this pandemic (to be fair though, many businesses had little income). In the end, I'm not sure this company would be stable.

I can DM the companies for more insight but all in all the big factor is stability and the marketability of the tech stack to be used. Which do you think is better?"

* Refuses to use source/version control (we pass around codes by copy-pasting to shared folder). This also mean I can only access the code base of the projects I'm working on.
* Has poor to non-existent devops framework (i.e. no automated tests, no project planning, etc)
* Doesn't have any coding style standards inplace (e.g. documentation style, variable naming)
* Poor code structure in general (e.g. repeated codes everywhere, unmodular codes)

I'm a math major and this is my first internship that involves a lot of programming; my time is split equally between research (e.g. data cleaning, statistical modelling) and programming (e.g. ETL pipelines, research modules/libraries). Though admittedly this is not an SWE internship, I'm actually putting codes into production here.

I only realized how much a problem this a few months into the job after learning on my own and contributing to open source projects. It feels disheartening to think that I'm learning more about best practices outside of my work hours - as mentorship should be a large part of an internship program.

Inspired by [How to convince my team to adopt source control?](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bkd97d/update_how_to_convince_my_team_to_adopt_source/) I decided to setup Git, put the source on a private GitHub repo, and write automated tests for the projects that I'm working on but my boss was not convinced on the benefit of doing this.

It also seems to me that my boss - and perhaps the company at large - are not very keen on learning 'new' concepts/technologies (and by 'new' I mean new to them). There were instances where I was asked to refactor my codes because I used something from the standard library that my boss is not familiar with - even though it greatly improved performance and readability - and could have been learned in an hour or so.

I have a few months left on this internship (I'm taking a year off college) and I'm not sure if this is worth it. That said, the pay is admittedly pretty good and I'm not sure if I can find other internships that easily, I'll likely just end up doing open-source and building stackoverflow reputation all day. But then again, even if I stay and manage to convince my boss to adopt some of the above best practices, but this gives rise to the following:

*Is it really a good to idea to reveal that my company does not even have source control - since that means I'm not receiving proper guidance - especially considering my background (or lack thereof) in software development?* 

Honestly, I've been feeling lost and demoralized lately. Any advice/suggestion would be very much appreciated."
2271,cscareerquestions,Startup With Potential,"Hey all, 

I've been lurking for a while and figure it's worth tossing out my question to get some diverse opinions on my current situation. I'm currently working as a data scientist at an early stage startup. My salary is 65k/yr, and some ownership with double of what I currently have being vested over the next 4 years. At its current valuation, this makes my first year worth roughly 90k.

I'm mainly doing NLP, and everything I do is the ""first"" for the company. So I am establishing infrastructure and models, managing interns, will be managing any new hires (which there is forecasted to be min. 1 in the coming 6 months). 

I have a planned raise for the new year but don't know how much it will be. I know that I am currently underpaid, but feel that there is a lot of potential for growth here making my equity worth it.

What I'm trying to find is whether I should continue to stick it out with this company for it's potential, or start pursuing higher salaries at larger companies. I've been contacted for several positions ranging from 100k-200k per year. My company has a lot of investor interest, but we're slow to acquire new clients.

Any thoughts or experiences are greatly appreciated. It's worth noting that I was hired here as a new grad, I've got 3 papers to my name and I feel my work at this company speaks for itself in my ability to perform in this realm."
2272,cscareerquestions,How to mentor junior developers,"I have over 7 years of experience in software development.

2285,cscareerquestions,"Is a bootcamp worth the time, money and quitting a job you're dissatisfied with?","I'm a bit lost in my career path and I'm not sure which path to take to grow and move forward.

I have a BS in Computer Science. For the majority of my career, I've been working in education as a Full Stack Developer. While institutions are behind the times in terms of technology, it feels good to be able to bring software to them. In my role, I oversaw an internal web application that acted as a data hub for our department.

The job was great because I enjoyed the idea of creating ways to deliver and represent our data. Eventually, I hit a ceiling and was afraid to be pigeonholed so I started looking for a new position. 

An old coworker introduced me to a position in another institution and he sold me on it so well. The title is Data Scientist and the institution needed someone to build upon their data hub, streamline their data and looking to ease their many data submissions.

Unfortunately, I feel like I fell victim to bait and switch. I'm mostly doing many manual data pulls with SQL queries and have been able to automate a handful of data pulls using Python and OneDrive. Otherwise, I'm not doing much aligned with my proposed role. 

I'm pretty much a digital filer and survey distributor. Their data hub was third party so I cannot have direct access to build upon it. Lastly, these submissions are just being thrown on me to do. I feel even more pigeonholed and feel like my technical skills are getting rusty.

With this, I feel like I' want to leave the education industry and I want to be part of something more innovative. 

With my experience, working with data seems to have caught my interest so I'm aiming to find a job in AI Engineering, Data Engineering or Data Science. However, I feel like I have very little experience given my previous roles.

I have doubts about this given the pandemic, but would eventually quitting my job and attending Data Science bootcamp be a good decision? I want to think that a bootcamp is more structured and would give me more time to build upon my almost non existent portfolio. 

Unless would slowly building my portfolio be the best thing now to decide on what exactly I want to pursue?"

The daily small talk in the kitchen is gone and managers are trying to 'rejuvenate' it virtually. So, they are implementing 8am coffee meetings... Oh no, this isn't a 'zoom call to chat'. They assign 4 people to a group, and you have to go to the meeting, and you get a topic and you have to discuss.

---

I get it, the discussion and camaraderie is gone now that everyone is virtual. And with us being developers, we aren't going out of our way to keep it up when we never see people or talk outside of work. We're introverts

But I'm not a child. I don't need you to schedule me an 'hour for talking' to coworkers. I'm sorry, i just don't care. Sure, before covid, it was nice to go to lunch and talk about non-work stuff, but now that we never see each other... I don't care.

Instead of the hour to drive to work, get settled in, where I spent talking to coworkers, I can now use that for myself, and to spend time with the people IN MY HOUSEHOLD. Thats the benefit of WFH.

Sure lets collab more at work on work. more virtual meetings and white boarding ideas. Instead of one 10min standup a day, through in discussions on testing/development standards/CI.

Let me spend more time with my own family and friends. I don't give a damn to be forced to make small talk with people I hardly talk to outside of work.

I do not have a CS degree (I majored in IS), hence the weird first job experience and support role now.

I've been at the new company for just over a year now and have learned a ton. However, I have also learned that support is not an area I wish to stay in for a long period of time. After gaining more exposure to devops folks, I decided a while back that that was the direction I wanted to head in. 

I shared this info with my team a while back, and they were happy to give me some projects and time to develop my skills in that area. The plan was to move me to the dev team winter of 2021. 

With all that said, I was just given a fairly substantial raise and an offer to be promoted to lead. To my understanding, the pay adjustment is not contingent on accepting the promotion.

So my dilemma is this:

Do I accept this promotion under the assumption that I *still* move into dev a year from now? Or do I politely decline and keep on track?

I have recently received an offer that would require me to relocate to Boston, and I currently live in Texas. The offer is pretty low for the area as it's only 65k and I have read that the business has the expectation that you will work more than 8 hours on a normal day (read this on Glassdoor in more that a few posts, however they were in departments that are not IT/Software), which is a no-go for me.

On the flip side, there are a couple other companies that I think I will get an offer from within the next couple of weeks. Here is the dilemma: either of those other potential offers would be better for my circumstances, however I don't want to walk the current offer in case the others do not pan out. What is the optimal way for me to handle this and minimize risk of screwing myself over?

The other two offers will be LCOL areas and will pay more than the Boston opportunity. They are a lot closer to me, so the relocation would not be nearly as expensive or burdensome. They also are very likely to promote way better work/life balance. I know that if I had all three offers in hand right now, the Boston position would not even be in consideration.

1. Self study entirely: I am a bit confused on how this would play out. I have heard that if you can learn Python and answer Leetcode you can get a job, but I have also heard that knowing Python alone going into your first role may not be enough—what is the reality?
2. OSU CS Post-Bacc: It’s a 60 credit program where you graduate with a BS in CS—the recommended track takes 2 years. I could probably finish the core CS classes (intro, intermediate, data structures+algos, discrete) in 9-12 months. That much would at least run me 7-9k in tuition—would that be worth it or enough to start applying for full time roles or at least internships?
3. A coding bootcamp: Have heard opinions on both ends of the spectrum, from it being useless to it being a life changer. Some also have interesting payment plans where they take a percentage of your starting salary post bootcamp... Problem is that it is (usually) a full time commitment...

Thanks!"

2314,cscareerquestions,Talking to my boss about a promotion in two hours and I have no idea what to say.,"I've been working as a support engineer (which has been extremely technical spanning lots of different areas) for the last year. This is my second ""real"" job out of college––the first job I had was a business-facing dev role for an archaic company using archaic tech. Not exactly the best start.

I do not have a CS degree (I majored in IS), hence the weird first job experience and support role now.

I've been at the new company for just over a year now and have learned a ton. However, I have also learned that support is not an area I wish to stay in for a long period of time. After gaining more exposure to devops folks, I decided a while back that that was the direction I wanted to head in.

I shared this info with my team a while back, and they were happy to give me some projects and time to develop my skills in that area. The plan was to move me to the dev team winter of 2021.

With all that said, I was just given a fairly substantial raise and an offer to be promoted to lead. To my understanding, the pay adjustment is not contingent on accepting the promotion.

So my dilemma is this:

Do I accept this promotion under the assumption that I still move into dev a year from now? Or do I politely decline and keep on track? Clearly the promotion looks good on paper, but I'm worried about pigeonholing.

Thank you in advance for your thoughts."

2318,cscareerquestions,"Lost all motivation, what to do?","I’m a junior in college and I have been doing very good so far in college. I remember my freshman and sophomore year I used to grind my ass off to work on classes, practice coding and studying for certification. But for past 3-5 months I have no motivation to grind like I used to. Like, I have goal that I want to achieve but I can’t motivate myself to start working on them, all I do nowadays is go to work, come back and waste rest of my day doing nothing 

For ex, I bought AWS certification course and Ds/Algorithms course that I was planning on doing over this winter break. I started both of them 2 weeks ago. But I lost motivation and haven’t touched any of those courses since then. 


Is this normal? How do I stop this? How can I get motivated again?"

2320,cscareerquestions,Feeling awkward during team placement.,"Hey yalls. So I am starting my new position this January with a cool big company with great compensation. (I graduate this December from undergrad CS).

My concern is I'm in the process of team placement. And I feel like in my experience, I have exclusively done low level coding. I never really learned/used the MongoDBs, .NETS, any of the SQL's, or Docker stuff. In all my internships I just kinda implemented APIs and coded in C++, C, and sometimes Python. All in a unique codebase the companies made. But i just worked on already established stuff. Im good at learning quickly but I just don't know the lingo that's thrown around sometimes. I know jack about front end too, never touched JS,CSS,etc.

I just feel weird not knowing these technologies at all. So I am trying to write a elevator pitch to the teams but its weird just saying, ""Hi I'm... and I've coded a lot in C++ C and Python."" without mentioning any frameworks they have listed. I just know how to code. 

TL;DR: Got a job at big company. I know how to code, I guess I'm backend. Never used any big name frameworks or technologies other than just pure coding languages. How do I pitch myself to the teams in my job I'm starting soon?"

2323,cscareerquestions,"Deciding whether or not to go for a post bacc, or keep grinding. Advice?","Hi everyone. I've been out of college for 2 years now (UW Physics/Astronomy) and last year completed a coding bootcamp (General Assembly Software Immersive) to try and break into the Tech industry. This December marks 1 year and 2 months of job searching (roughly 600+ applications), and while I understand this is likely due to Covid, ultimately it still means I am unemployed. 

I am considering getting a postbacc in CS. Wondering what opinions are out there considering my situation. Listed out some pros and cons I thought of, but would love to hear other perspectives.

Pros:

* Ability to network with people through coursework/internships
* Better CS fundamentals
* More Defined Goal/Direction
* Suggested by my parents (financial support)
* Potential internship opportunities otherwise unavailable to me
* Opens up more job types I can apply to (outside of JS/React + whatever I learned this year on my own)

Cons:

* More money on loans 
* Another 1-2 years of school
* Alma Matter Doesn't accept postbacc apps, would have to search for other programs
* No guarantee job search will improve after completion
* Being dirt poor for another 1-2 years"

2326,cscareerquestions,MS in a good university vs Experience vs Job+OMSCS,"The title itself should work I guess. Let's get into what I already have.

1. A bachelor's in CS (graduating this June)
2. If everything goes right a 9.3+ CGPA. which would become 9.1 in the worst case
3. And a FTE offer in FAANG (which ngl, sounds pretty awesome in these times)

Now I am sure that I want to work for at least a year so that I can pay off loans that I took for my bachelor's. They were partial so my joining bonus + 3 months salary would pay that. What I'm trying to say is, the loans are not that massive.

What I'm confused about is what to do after this one year. Since depending upon what I decide to do, I have to plan stuff and study in my off time.

1. A MS degree sure looks good and it's always better to have that extra certification. And I like studying as well so it's not like I'm doing MS just for the sake of it. Although to be fair, the pay-hike from a MS is a stronger motivation. From the popular media, living in the US (as a student, I don't have plans to settle there just yet) seems fun too. (I'm from India btw)
2. On the other hand, software inherently favours practicality over theory. I'm confused if I would be trading off the practical aspect of software in exchange for a shiny piece of paper and just delay my life for 2 years.
3. I also stumbled upon the OMSCS program from GTech. This seems like a good combination of the two since now I can work on it my free time and don't have to jump through too many hoops to get admitted (like GRE, TOEFL, interviews etc- which I don't mind btw.  I, about 90% of the times test well). But it kinda looks like a money printer for the uni. It feels like even after I put in the effort, there would be an asterisk hovering over me my entire life. Is it even worth it? Or is it just a way to pass a qualification on job postings?

I am confused about which of the 3 to select. I know about each of their pros and cos. I just can't rank them. From the pov of putting in efforts, the second one (just work ex) is the most easy one. The compensation feels too good right now but I think that might mean letting go of opportunities in the future by not having a MS. What do you think I should do or what would you do in this case?"

My previous bachelors was in a science based field non tech related, and the highest math class I took was precalc and I struggled with it a bit. My dad keeps telling me to stick to IT because he says the only coding jobs are on the left coast and there's more opportunity in IT, less competition from MIT grads and people that have been coding their whole life, and you don't have to do math. Trying to decide what path is better, I'm almost tempted to try CS because these certs are starting to feel like a scam and I've gotten no job offers. Also, the highest salary I've been offered is 40k and right now I'm only making 14 an hour, but my dad keeps saying people in IT can make up to 60-80k and at both fields I'll have to start at the bottom.

I never bothered getting an internship during my program because I’m getting paid decently (~80k) and liked where I worked.

Now, almost a year after, I've started a degree in computer science and mathematics (it's just one degree but its called like that) and I keep working part-time but I've seriously started wondering if spending 4 years of my life studying is worth the investment given that I am already working as a software developer. My plan isn't to stay here forever, I would like to eventually move to other EU countries with better salaries, so would not having a degree limit my job prospects in other EU countries like Germany, the Netherlands (maybe the UK but I don't know about the situation after Brexit), or can I compensate that by gathering enough experience here before considering migrating?

In a few years, I'd like to move into storage engine development, and I'm hoping this project can be used to showcase the things I've learned to the companies I apply to.

My Options:

C++: The classic database development language. I enjoy C++ and have used it extensively, but it's build and tooling system are horrific. It also makes testing more difficult than modern languages. However, from my research it seems this is most often used by companies developing databases.

Go: I recently learned Go and have really enjoyed my time with it. I'd like to use it more due to its ease of use. When I get to the distributed part, Go has built in packages that will help with this, unlike C++.

If I'm being honest I'd like to use Go, but I'm worried that my project won't be as impressive to systems/db companies if I use a language primarily associated with back end web development - especially if those companies develop in C++.

Having recently joined this sub and seeing how hard it is for so many of you who have a wayyyyyy better resume and skill than me is discouraging to say the least.

I hear that the field of IT contains less of theory and is more practical. I actually used to be a paramedic and quite liked working with my hands and applying my knowledge directly to whatever situation called for it. I also love setting up and learning about new tech.

I was never looking to work for a fancy new start up and make 100K out of school, or be recruited by one of the big four. I just want to have a career that pays decently well, has room to advance and that I enjoy doing. Also I'm not even sure that sitting at a desk and programming all day appeals to me at this point. I reside in Canada if that makes any difference."
2355,cscareerquestions,College Computer Science is a Scam," I left undergrad with a degree I absolutely *hate* (long story as to how I trapped myself with that damn thing) yet work experience I loved. I bit the STEM propaganda in high school hook, line and sinker. Hook, line and sinker, more like handcuffs, noose and concrete shoes. I spent the second half of undergrad under fairly nasty conditions; nearly died my junior year, and senior year I found myself stuck catering every spare moment to a toxic (narcissist) individual. No time for networking, no chance to rethink and change majors, it was simply going to class, labs, putting in time in my work position, then dealing with the nagging obligations of that one individual. Managed to trap myself with a degree in biochemistry, absolutely worthless, and it's reflected more than enough in the pitiful salaries that are offered, if one can manage to find a way to even become employed in my hometown with an allegedly great economy in the first place.

I hit a really dark spot, here I was looking at jobs, applying for positions I didn't even have the faintest interest in, let alone passion, the search was a nagging obligation, interviews all the same. I felt like I had no other choice but to pursue it, and abandon any hope of FatFire. For the greater part, I was working on these jobs to get away from that toxic individual and to get them off my back when all they could do was harp, berate and attempt to bully me into some job they only wanted me get so they could live vicariously through me. Working to find full time employment took precedent just for the chance of escape, and it became a fight, a struggle. Fighting against a lack of interest, lack of being intouch with myself, fighting against the living conditions, fighting against the tech industry that just had to come here, until I said enough.

I feel like my STEM degree in the real, physical sciences was/is a complete sham, like I spent 4 years for a bottle of snake oil. I resent the tech industry with every fiber of my being, and haven't the faintest idea in how people can find interest in computers/software/coding in the first place, unless it's purely for the paycheck, as it appears to be one of the few industries that prevents people from being trapped in the middle class, worse yet, the suburbs. About the only thing I am grateful for, and gives me the faintest hope at FatFire, is my work experience. My hometown is a struggle, yet people have flocked here in droves seemingly without a single issue in landing a decent job. During that time I've retained the position I had in undergrad, which was working with a subject matter expert in foresnic analysis, typically with defense. That bridge of science and the legal industry truly has my interest, particularly in the legal capabilities. Jobs with my current credentials are useless for FatFire, but this year I have been working on applying to law school, and studying for the LSAT. I could easily see myself in intellectual property, among other discplines that would crossover. I really just had to find a way to still cling onto some sort of hope. In the struggle since graduation, I've had many long nights, nights where I doubted I would even see the following morning, or any consecutive one for that matter. A better degree, a better industry, that's what I have, and it what keeps me working towards progress, it certainly has to be better than what I currently have, and if I have to stick around in this scenario for much longer, I dont think I have it in me for another go around."

So there are 2 companies:
Company A is a tech startup that has expanded and grown quite a bit so it isn't very new nor a unicorn.
Company B is a more mature company which pays ~15k more annually and seems more stable.
I think working in both companies will be interesting and exciting in their own ways.

I received an offer a week ago with company A for QA engineer role but I would like to complete my internship as a software engineer with company B first before I decide. The thing is, company B hasn't offered me a job but would like me to go through the internship before discussing a job. My internship will only start in Jan and end in May so I will only find out if I have a job offer with company B in May. I would rather work at company B but I don't know for sure if they will offer me a job there or not. I would also prefer the software engineer role at company B.

I thought about asking company A to hold the offer for me until May but this is far too long right? I also thought about telling company B my predicament but I'm not sure if this would be placing the ball in their court too much. I'm also not sure if this will change anything anyway since they said the job offer is based on my performance during the internship.

I'm also afraid of the worst case scenario of rejecting company A now and also not receiving an offer from company B after the internship in May.

What should I do? Thanks in advance! :)"

I'm just experiencing a lot of stress amd anxiety over how I perform. I'm not sure if I'm performing too slow or if my boss is just making a big thing out of it.

In summary, this is the latest project that stresses me, it's an app for logging work and managing projects:
* Adapt Flutter app to a new web API including new url, models and requests
* Stop watch view for logging time
* View for listing, editing and deleting time logs
* View for registering material/articles with quantity
* VIew for listing, deleting, and editing material/articles
* Feature for locking the registered time logs weekly
* All listings are paged btw loading 10 at a time
* Among this you have to load projects, user data, tasks and work orders
* Bug tests, fixes and make all layouts work for different screen sizes including tablets
* Upload to Google Play and App Store

This took me about 60 hours of work to do. Does it sound very slow to you or just plain average?

I have worked with Flutter for 2 years (not only I'm full stack) so I'm very familiar with it. But I'm no guru yet ofcourse and I still make mistakes. I also have a visual impairment. I'm legally blind but far from completely blind. Not sure how much my eye sight slows  me down but my employer gets like 20% of my salary from the state as a support for my handicap.

Do you ever experience this stress? What do you think about my situation? 

I just wanted to vent and get some feedback. I might just suffer from impostor syndrome. Why would they employ me for 2 years if I sucked?

Thanks for your support!"

2395,cscareerquestions,I am a returning student getting a CS degree. How best to highlight the large improvement over previous degree GPA with current degree GPA? And generally does my plan for internship and job after graduation sound feasible or improvements to be made?,"US - School is generally ranked in top 20% for CS (if that is relevant I'm not sure with what I've read on the sub from different folks).

I received my business degree 6-7 years ago, and after working in SaaS companies Dev adjacent for so long realized I just really wished I'd not gone with a generic BA when I was an immature 18 year old kid, as I wasn't happy with that career direction. Now that I am older, I am returning to get my CS degree and will be done in 2022 - and I am a much better student this time around, with great grades compared to last time.

I know that many of the internships for next summer I'm starting to look at have floors on GPA for applicants, and am wondering how best to show my GPAs. Is listing the cum GPA next to the first degree and Current GPA next to the in progress degree the way to go? I want to show I am very good at the CS material, without showing that last time around I was a pretty average student (since I was very uninterested in all the subject matter, and just learning in general at that age).

I'm highlighting my previous work experience with Product and client software support, but am worried that I am applying to internships with so little experience in the field. Long term I wish to become a gameDev programmer, but as I do not learn any C++ until next Fall, those internships seem a little out of reach as I don't know what they require. My plan was to potentially go for a Java position for next summer and then a C++ gameDev programming internship right after I graduate and try and turn that into a full time position at the end of summer 2020.

I am finishing up my master's in mechanical engineering. I originally had planned on going down the research path, but realize that I was not suited for that kind of work plus I really do not want work in the defense industry. My thesis has required a lot of programming and really showed me how much I enjoyed that kind of work. The reasons I would like to switch to a software development career are: 

1. Better pay and better predicted job growth
2. Higher career flexibility and mobility (find a job anywhere)
3. Work that I will find much more enjoyable/interesting

However, I have been in a dedicated job search for almost 6 months and had very little success. I do not feel like I have the necessary experience on my resume to get call backs and in the few interviews I have had my lack of experience in web specific technologies has definitely been a detriment.

My question is to pursue a software development career, what is the best logical next step?

1. I could get a second bachelor's. I got a minor in CS and have all of my generals covered so it would take 1.5-2 years. The main advantage that I see to this is the possibility to get in on internship cycles which I feel would be very beneficial for getting a good job
2. A coding bootcamp. This is the quicker option, but I am not sure how it would look in combination with my master's degree, but if it gets my foot in the door I would be happy.
3. The self taught route. This is something I have already been pursuing, but I have had very little time to dedicate to it outside of my thesis project. I dislike how open ended this option is, and I am concerned that it would not be as effective.

I feel like an idiot for getting a master's degree in a field that I ultimately don't want to be in, but I am looking to find the best way forward and I am hoping for honest opinions. Thanks!"

Need thoughts and advice.,"I just graduated and one of the major problems I faced while applying to internships and jobs was the fact that it was really hard to manage them when I applied through Handshake, Indeed, LinkedIn, etc. I ended up turning to excel sheets and emails which feels very primitive.

A few questions:

1. Would you be willing to use such a product (for free of course) once I finish developing it?
2. What kind of features would you like to see?
3. What feels more intuitive? app-based or a Gmail-integration?

2403,cscareerquestions,Company policy (preCOVID) is remote work is ok with us if ok with your manager,"Right now my company has been working remotely due to COVID. I’m loving it. My life has improved in so many ways. I save 8-12 hours a week in commute time alone. 

My company has had a long-standing policy that remote work is ok with them, as long as your manager is on board. We have solid infrastructure to support remote work (which has become apparent during COVID) and we have many remote employees already. 

My manager constantly complains about working remotely and she has never seemed supportive of remote work in the past, kind of begrudgingly letting people work remotely if they had to be at their apartment for a maintenance appointment or whatever. I know that her management style is very hands-on (kinda micromanagey tbh) and she likes to randomly drop by your desk to see what you’re working on right-this-minute. 

I never want to go back to the office full time. 

According to all my performance reviews, I’ve been super high performing. And I constantly get positive feedback from my boss about how high quality my work is, great communication, great interactions with other team members, representing the team well to other teams/groups, and that I’m super reliable.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I’m nervous about bringing up the idea to my boss because I’m worried she will see how serious I am about it and I expect a lot of push back. I realize I may need to start job hunting for a more suitable role, but I wouldn’t want her to fire me."

2406,cscareerquestions,What advice would you give to a 3rd year university Computer Science student who does not understand any of the modules he's studying?,"Hi. Since the second year of CS I noticed I really really lack some very basic maths concepts about linear algebra, calculus and probability. I managed to pass the second year because Covid made it easier to copy from my classmates.
Every time I open a lecture slide, it takes me hours to even grasp 1/4 of it and I end up feeling depressed and extremely stupid (the lectures slides are not related the last year content).

Should I take a year off uni and study maths to be better prepared when I start my 3rd year again?

I feel very overwhelmed by the work and the fact that I can't understand anything about the subject I'm studying makes it almost impossible for me to find the motivation to do anything.

Finally, and this is a bit unrelated, I feel like I'm studying stuff that I could be learning from elsewhere and much much better. 3blue1brown and statQuest explain concepts about machine learning, linear algebra and calculus 100 times better than any professor I had. I could be learning Machine Learning for free, web development for free, game development etc. but instead I'm followimg a ""Introduction to Data Compression"" module that I don't understand that's taking me at least 2 hours a day that I could be spending so much more efficently and learning things that are going to help me in my life. So I'm very discouraged by how things are going for me at the moment and I have no idea what to do."

After accepting a new offer or after a background check completion? In this case I couldn’t wait until after the background check in order to give my current job the right amount of notice and to let my manager know before the background check because he will have to do the employment verification for me.

I'm an embedded developer with about 4 years of experience. I'd say that my experience is pretty solid both in terms of quality of work and companies I worked at.

In terms of programming languages I've gotten pretty good at C, C++, and python for writing scripts.

I would like to switch my career to backend service development, but my problem is I feel like so many places are ignoring my resume because they're not comfortable with someone who's work experience is centred around firmware and embedded devices.

Any advice on what to work on? or what to learn and put on my resume?

Should I start learning Java?

Probably the major skill that backend service developer would need and an embedded developer would have very little experience is databases, both RDS and NoSQL. I've learned a lot about databases by studying them but obviously don't have the practical work experience, any advice on how to compensate for this?

I suppose another concern would be OO development but this one I'm good at, though again don't have much to show in my work experience.

2450,cscareerquestions,"What would you consider to be a ""basic"" understanding of a programming language?","Hi all, I think I'm mostly freaking out here because I'm interviewing for one of the companies I've always wanted to work for. 

I listed 2 of the 3 programming languages they are looking for in the description which are C++ and Python. My current job doesn't have me programming at all and while I have been feeling really confident I think now that my interview is coming up I'm freaking out a little by the ambiguity of how much I should know in terms of basics of C++ and Python. 

I know this is subjective but these vague terms get thrown around a lot, I've seen basic, beginner, intermediate, advanced, fluent, etc... levels of knowledge and I know that not all companies treat these the same and one company's intermediate can be another company's advanced etc... I guess I'm just trying to get a rough understanding of what any of you would consider basic C++ and Python. I kind of took it to be the equivalent of what you'd learn in an intro and part of an intermediate course on any of these languages. 

Here is what I know for sure:

C++:

The majority of the keywords (especially the most used ones)

Loops, conditionals, variables, functions (basically anything you see in an intro to programming class/ the structures that are essentially the same for all languages)

Classes, Inheritance, Interfaces, virtual functions/ classes (I think they have a focus on OOP so I might be ok here)

References and Pointers (single pointers ok, double pointers shaky, triple pointers and beyond no hope)

Containers although the only one I've really ever used is vector but I know I can get the others down easily.

Some generics but not a whole lot I have a super basic understanding of how those work. 

Concurrency

&amp;#x200B;

Python: 

The majority of the keywords (especially the most used ones)

Loops, conditionals, variables, functions (basically anything you see in an intro to programming class/ the structures that are essentially the same for all languages)

Lists, Dicts, Tuples, and all their versions of containers and iterable stuff 

Basic list comprehensions

String manipulation

2454,cscareerquestions,Is Programming Bootcamps Worth it?,"Mild backstory so that you can understand my sitiuation: 

I'm now 24 in Philly and I've put off college for a couple of years and work after high school because I couldn't afford it. Recently I was offered a good position running a store that would pay me close to 50k and allow me to pay for school, but unfortunately, Covid-19 hit my hopes with a ton of bricks and caused the store I was supposed to start running to close down. I'm now working only 18 hours as just an associate and doing uberEats on the side.  So all in all, its not looking like i'll be able to attend college for CS for a while. 

So recently I've been looking at other options, while studying programming and reading some books in the process, and Im wondering if a programming bootcamp would be a step in the right direction to  get my foot in the door. I still eventually want to attend college because I want to get my masters and work with artificial intellegence, but I feel like the hardest step is actually getting into the field, espiecially having no experience or schooling. 

I hear from different sources that bootcamps are the best thing imaginable to get into the field cheap  but I hear from others that people that graduate from bootcamps are notoriously bad at coding and often rejected because of it. But I'm wondering if i would be able to get a job with a Bootcamp and be able to move forward to get a job and maybe be able to afford college with it.

I don't know if I want to take on an additional financial burden for something that may not be worth it though, So if anyone has any advice, it would be much appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Is a programming bootcamp and good first step to get into the field all things considered?"

2457,cscareerquestions,What should be my next step to get into a software engineering position?,"Hello all!  


I just graduated in June with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering with a concentration in computer systems design. I have a couple years of experience in technical project management. I lost my job in March and haven't been able to get anything else, so I'm starting to get really worried. It doesn't seem like there are many entry level project management jobs out there right now, so that's becoming less of an option. I have $23k in student loans and I have about $26k saved up. I foresee making about $1k/month.

I see three options that I could do right now:

* Self-study using Cracking the Coding Interview, do some side projects, some MOOCs, hope I land some more interviews. I'm not sure if I'm capable of doing this the right way, and I'm afraid the longer I wait, the less employers will consider my degree valuable/relevant.
* Do a grad program (most likely Georgia Tech's online MS in CS since it's cheap). This option scares me because the program wouldn't start until August and it would take 2 years to finish.
* Do a coding bootcamp. This option also scares me because it'd be about $14k (although I would love to hear about other's experiences in other bootcamps, especially if they were cheaper). This would be nice because it'd be over in 3-4 months and I could focus on getting a job. However, this would wipe out almost all of my savings. It would also mean I could start working sooner and making money sooner."

The thought of delivering a rehearsed BS answer makes me sick to my stomach honestly.

After the initial successful test, I wrote another solution to optimize. While writing comments on this optimization, the timer ran out, and the code was submitted.  

This code won't currently compile as one of the solutions needed to be commented out before submission.  

Will CodeVue save my best ""run all test cases"" solution (the successful one), or will it recompile and submit the final portion?  

I'm concerned this may show up as a failure on the CodeVue report because the ""final submission"" (which I didn't intend on submitting) does not compile.

I am planning on going back to school in the future and getting a relevant Bachelor's degree, but I can't do it untill the end of next year, because I have some personal and financial problems to sort out first.

I will add that I am not very good at math and I don't really enjoy it very much either. However, I can think logically and try to solve problems. I will say that I am more of a creative person.

2481,cscareerquestions,Is part-time freelancing a thing with a main job?,"I just had my HR and tech interviews, and I’m pretty confident that I’ll get the job. 
I live in a 3rd world country, right now, I’m a freelancer and I make a lot more than what the company is offering. My main question is that, is it a common practice to do part time freelance along with your main job?"
2482,cscareerquestions,There is an aspect of this profession that I am struggling to master - Social Interactions.,"I have been working at a famous company(Not FAANG, but equally good) for 3 years. I did an internship at a famous bank in New York as a software engineer before this. I am good at writing software. I was good at leetcode that's how I got this job. But the thing that I most struggle with is Social Interactions! Since today is a Saturday I basically have nothing to do, So I actually did some brainstorming and came up with specific areas where I struggle with the most and the reasons why I struggle.  


**Requirements gathering**:  
(1) People are generally averse to having a requirement gathering meeting with Junior engineers. Most people would rather focus on their own work then answer someone else's questions.  
(2) Most of my questions are of the form, if we were to make X change to Y system, Y system would then feed input to Z system which would throw an error isn't it? The most stereotypical answers I usually get are: ""Why are you asking me about Z system, you need to research more about how Z system works"" or ""I don't care what the Z system does, the only thing I care about are the current requirements"" or ""Haven't I already explained this to you?"" or ""Your job is to make a change to Y system, why are you asking about Z system?"".

(3) That whole thing about there is no stupid question is a myth. People have a threshold of how many questions you can ask before they lose their temper.

(4) If you are not aware of who worked on what part of the system, there is a very good chance that an innocent question you are asking might appear as a personal attack to someone who wrote that part of the system.   


**Testing**:  
(1) There is no way to circumvent manual testing. Your team might have written 1000s of lines of unit tests, integration tests, regression tests. But at the end of the day, you have to click through the UI to make sure your code changes work before you submit the PR.   
(2) People get irritated when you ask them to explain how to generate a certain type of input to the backend system, most of the time either they don't know or they don't think it is important to test that.  
(3) If you ask someone how to test a case that they think is not important, they are most likely to think, that you are wasting their time and get irritated.

(4) Judging by the way you did requirements gathering, you might think that testing the cases t1, t2, t3 is adequate. But in actuality, the most important thing you were supposed to test was t4, which is absolutely the thing that is most likely to crash in production. Chances are that this situation was supposed to be covered by a unit test case, but someone slacked off.

(5) Finding out, what is necessary to test, and what is unnecessary could make the difference between finishing the project in 2 days vs 6 days.  


**Code reviews**:

(1) If people think something is unnecessary, for example, rewriting a 20-year-old Bash/Perl amalgam in Python + Pandas, which your TL asked you to do, people will use code reviews to harass the hell out of you. You need social skills to convey this to your TL or Manager without making it look like you are playing politics to get out of doing some work.

(2) Even in a 20 line code reviews, people misunderstand the changes you are making. Waste several days going back and forth on the changes and ultimately concede to the fact that the changes you are making are justified. I noticed that this does not happen with people who are confident in their abilities and knowledge of the system.

(3) People have a tendency to harass you into changing an aspect of your code change purely because of their personal bias. A guy in my team has a Bias against Pandas and he made me waste a whole week re-writing a 50 line code change into a 250 line code change that didn't use Pandas. My TL took his side completely. His justification was that Pandas for Python 3.7 is not available on Sun, AIX machines. This was a very dumb stupid argument because we are actively trying to get off of non-Linux machines. In this situation, if I would have aggressively challenged his Pandas Bias, I could have saved my time.   


**Deployments**:

(1) This is a particularly painful area when you are dealing with older engineers, who are not that versed with modern technologies. Recently I wrote an init.d script to start and stop a service. The traditional way was to create a bunch of start, stop bash scripts, and hook it into a giant bash script that the environment support people run manually every time a server restarts. There are plenty of teams who are moving to init.d, I was not being rebellious when I suggested the init.d approach. But it was very painful to convince this older gentleman, who has been working as a software engineer for 36 years :| Again, my lack of confidence, social skills wasted a lot of time.

 (2) People don't approve environment support tickets for deployments that they don't understand. a lot of times, convincing them and not trying to look like you are educating them is very tricky. 

(3) Convincing people that some aspect of deployment work is not necessary is painful. They think you are being lazy. You think you are being smart. 

**Language problems**:  
(1) I am an Indian and I am a non-native English speaker, I struggle a bit with Spoken English. With written English, I can proof-read what I wrote several times but with Spoken English I have to frame sentences in my head in real-time. I have social anxiety which also makes this particularly difficult. Also, I never really learned English grammar in the traditional way. I could speak better English than most of my peers, so I always felt learning grammar to learn English is unnecessary.   
(2) The thing is, when I am talking to someone about a leader-election problem in a software system, I need to be able to focus my thoughts on Zoo-keeper not my English language skills. This is something that I am working on off-late. I am very insecure about my speaking abilities. So I am naturally distracted when I am talking to my teammates in English.  


Since this is r/cscareerquestions, my question is, how do I master social interactions. Surely, I must not be the only person who experienced these problems working in a team right?"

I have roughly 1.5 years of experience as a test engineer but I got interviewed for an embedded SWE position and the interview was a mix of going over my resume and basic algo questions. Nothing was asked in super technical details but I guess the idea was to see if I can say stuff confidently. For the things I didn't know, I clearly said so. Nothing was asked specific to embedded itself.

I have accepted an offer mainly cause I was kind of desperate to get into dev and not get pigeonholed in testing but I keep getting negative thoughts of not being able to do the job well enough.

However, I took 3 computer science classes in high school and disliked all of them, I realized my personality is not a puzzle solver which I feel is essential to programming (example : I'd always ask for help when coding rather than spending countless hours doing what seemed meaningless to me as I'd always end up at the start again). I know that having a cs major is extremely good for jobs in the future, but I'm not sure if I can handle the classes in college, can I get some opinions on what similar people would do in my situation, choosing a major right now is really stressing me out. I also have no idea what I'd enjoy because of my career path on cs so far, (I've done some business clubs on marketing etc. and I enjoyed them), but I'm not as familiar to business than technology. Are there any other majors in college that isn't as coding heavy but really good for jobs in the future?"

2510,cscareerquestions,Loathe software engineering and looking for some advice about an exit plan.,"Hi! I’ve been working at a startup in the valley for 2 years since I graduated from college. Unfortunately, I neither had the best GPA (maybe a 3 science average GPA thanks to screwing up most of my upper div CS and engineering classes) nor the smartest networking skills (didn’t try making friends in CS and somehow managed to screw up my job applications).  


These two years have been split into roughly 1.5 years of bitch work (no projects to work on, no guidance, random tasks such as just moving code around or improving method names) and the last six months of a crap ton of random work that I have no background in, and can’t ask for help without being chastised for it (I’ve gotten feedback that I both ask too many questions and ask too few questions).  I largely hate fixing bugs, and honestly feel no sense of satisfaction figuring out the tricky ones (race conditions or whatever)- it just weighs on me for weeks, ruins my sleep, and I just feel relief when it’s done. I actually don’t mind both refactoring code, improving performance and some higher level fixes- once things get into concurrency I feel like I’m just out of my depth.

I either largely dislike my coworkers or have weird friendships with them, where I don’t really feel like I can afford to not be their friends, so I end up being one, and end up in situations where I get way too much information about their personal lives. 

My reasons for entering this field were dubious too- I wanted to succeed in a male dominated field and beat the stereotypes. I just never realized that I would care for something so little and essentially be an average to below average SWE at best. As I struggled through upper div classes, I told myself I’d give it a shot for 10 years, make some money at least, and figure out an alternate plan after that...

But now I realize- my shitty undergrad GPA seems to be a black mark on me forever? if I wanted to go to med school or law school, this is going to drag me down.

And- the point of my post- if anyone here has ever felt the same, or has switched out of SWE, please tell me how you did so! I just really, really need hope that I’m not bound to debugging race conditions for ever. Does anyone have any advice on how I should fix this huge mess I’ve managed To make?"
2511,cscareerquestions,"I’m finally starting to like my job, not just for the money","I graduated about a year ago and took the return offer for a quant finance firm. I’ve been working here for almost a year, and for most of this time, I’ve been in it for the paycheque. Every day was a grind, and boy those days were long too. I felt a lot of anxiety, and pressure, which the pandemic didn’t help. I looked at my bank and brokerage accounts at least once every day to keep me going.

Recently, all that started to change though. The learning curve here was quite steep, and my days alternated between feeling competent, and feeling like I didn’t belong because I couldn’t figure out the solution to a bug or that I was working too slowly. But I’m starting my to actually get a hang of the codebases my team owns, and I’m solving most of my assigned work without any hand holding. I’ve also recently been assigned some projects that require relatively complex designs including improving the performance of some parts of our trading systems (thank God I did a lot of LeetCode). This is actually starting to be really fun.

I think Cal Newport is right. You develop a passion for your job as you become more competent at it. Thoughts?"

I am in California where there are stellar comp sci schools such as Cal and UCLA but my chances of getting there are slim but doable of course. Pretend if I go to a CSU will it put me at a huge disadvantage over others in the job market ?"
2513,cscareerquestions,Missing the feeling of learning in class. What are some mandatory books to read for a software engineer?,"I've seen books like Clean Code and Design Patterns recommended. What are must-read books that can help someone become a better software engineer overall? Not just books about generic coding practices, but maybe even domain specific knowledge too.

I'm asking this as a more general question to appeal to a wider audience, but I guess one specific thing I would like to know is a more advanced level book for structuring larger python programs and python conventions since I've only done these things in Java."

Are there a lot of opportunities or just one vacancy here and there?"
2515,cscareerquestions,"How do you become a ""power programmer"", i.e., someone who is very efficient at using their toolchain?","I am a junior programmer mostly working from home like everyone else, so little hands-on mentorship besides code reviews. I am friendly with someone more senior. He's actually seen me programming and was able to point out ways I could more efficiently use my toolchain (combinations on VSCode to do certain classes of edits faster, a faster way to use the Chrome dev tools to do style edits in CSS). One of the quotes I remember from that session, paraphrased, is

&amp;#x200B;

""A good developer has to be a power user of their toolchain and be able to type at least 120 wpm""

&amp;#x200B;

Without this kind of hands-on management/learning tricks of the trade by watching seniors, how can I get better at using developer toolchains? 

&amp;#x200B;

Examples of things I do regularly

\- backend development in Scala and Akka/Akka HTTP in VSCode and Metals

\- scripting in Python typically using requests and json

\- frontend development in React on VSCode using TypeScript and Parcel 

&amp;#x200B;

**Note:** please, what this post isn't is a discussion of whether the assertion regarding typing speed and usage of the toolchain is correct or not :) thank you"

I graduated a few years ago from a top 10 CS school, and was strong in undergrad math/stats, but I would really value having a solid graduate level understanding of these topics.

From what I understand there are multiple different types of masters programs where I can optimize to learn the same set of quantitative skills, with a few differences:

    Ms in statistics
    Ms in machine learning
    Master of finance
    Ms or Meng in computer science
    Master of financial engineering

I have a few questions for anyone who is willing to help:

1) How are these different types of degrees viewed in the industry, and could you rank them in order of usefulness for quant dev work?

2) Are there other important topics besides math/stats I should try to include in my curriculum (distributed algorithms, stream processing, etc)?

2525,cscareerquestions,How many chances do you give a company?,"This is a bit of a rant regarding one particular company I have had the displeasure of interviewing with twice.  

For some background my undergrad degree was not STEM and I started out working for a large tech company in their customer service team. I quickly realized I hated it and moved into their IT Service management division. I worked there for several years and during this time took computer science courses, networking certs and did some basic automation programming on the side for my job. Decided to go back to school full time because my fundamentals in computer science were lacking and I wanted to be more in the development side vs IT. Working on a masters because second bachelor's would cost more and be same or more time.   


Brings me to point of post, there is a company that consistently recruits from my school looking for CS/CE and is in an adjacent industry to where I want to be (could help me a lot to get clearances). I interviewed with them twice, once when I first arrived at grad school and again a year in, I should graduate this summer.  


First time, I was admittedly not experienced in development, particularly in their primary language of C++, they really harped on this. I was very clear I wasn't looking for an IT job, but 75% of the interview boiled down to the interviewer trying to shoehorn me in that direction because of my work experience. I wrote this off as something that would get better once I had been back to school more than a month.  

Fast forward a year and I have had several development positions while at school including current job which is for research platform written all C++. Feeling eminently qualified and I interview again. Do the full nine yards this time going to mixer before interview, etc. Get to interview and interviewer is poorly prepared, talks for half the allotted time about themself, then doesn't realize I'm a graduate student until I correct them, begins to criticize my resume and even goes so far as to pull out another student's resume to compare it against. These were style critiques that are anything but universal (this interviewer happened to prefer five page long 10 size single spaced font listing everything you've ever done) and things like stating that education should be listed before my professional history.   

The first interview wasn't terrible if I'm honest, but the second is easily the worst I've ever had, I didn't even bother going further with the application process at that point. I'll have another chance before I graduate but I doubt I'll  want to try. Doesn't seem worth it."

Prior to this, I worked for \~3 years in one of India's largest fin-tech startup. 

Since August, I have applied to lots of internship positions.  I believe that I have a decent profile and should be qualified enough for internship positions at most of these companies. For quite a few of these applications, I haven't heard back anything from the company, and for lots of companies I have got a direct rejection mail and for a handful of these, I got an online assessment(OA) round. Sadly, I have received a rejection even after doing well in the OA. In nutshell, I haven't got a chance for a telephonic interview in a single company. 

Based on the above, I have a few questions which I believe many other students might also have. 

\- Am I the only one who is in this situation or are students, in general, are seeing fewer conversions this year?

\- Is the hiring process impacted because of COVID, US elections(due to future H1B considerations), economic slowdown, etc? 

\- Which aspects have the most impact when the recruiter views my profile/resume? I believe that I would score in terms of past work experience, grades, resume, Linkedin, Github. 

\- With the volume of applications companies might be receiving, is my profile even reaching in the hands of the recruiter or is it just getting automatically rejected based on Visa status or any other factors?

2556,cscareerquestions,My Horrible Startup Experience as a Developer Employee,"Hi fellow programmers,

Your personal interests matter, right?

It is in your interest to keep growing as a developer, being able to pursue your own dreams, living your life outside of your job, and so much more.

These interests aren't always respected by employers. Please take a moment to read about my experience working at a startup with rougly 30 employees, most of which are not developers.

tl;dr at the bottom

**About me**

To begin, let me tell you about myself. I am a mid 20s male living in a Northern EU country. I have about 4 years of professional programming experience. The startup was my second job. I love programming, and I am the type of person who codes in their spare time as well as a hobby. I'm very motivated to grow as a developer who recently started their career.

I am also ambitious, and would like to one day have my own parttime or fulltime programming business selling products and or services. This was part of the motivation for me to start working at a startup: to learn more about building such a business. Being able to create a product from scratch is one of those things I've always loved about being a developer.

**Starting at a startup**

Before I started my first day on the job, my employer asked me if I could pick a laptop I'd like to work with, so I spent some time researching a laptop and found a good one.

I was so excited for my first week on the job. This was going to be a real step up from my last job, which was a fine first job but I couldn't grow my technical skills any further there.

The first day: I arrive at the correct time, but the people who were supposed to set me up with my gear weren't in the office yet. That's fine, I didn't mind the wait.

When they finally got there it turned out they didn't have a laptop prepared for me. I was then given an old laptop they had laying around. I was then told they weren't going to order the laptop they asked me to choose. Every developer would be working on the same type of Lenovo laptop. Not what I wanted, but also not that big of a deal. The research for a laptop was a bit of a waste now, but oh well, not a big deal.

After getting my machine setup with Linux I was going to start working on an existing SaaS of the company. This was great, except there was no developer onboarding, and they were using their own framework which was poorly documented. Not great, but I was able to look at the source code and ask questions to the framework's authors because they fortunately were still employed at the company.

A few months later I was tasked with a solo project for which I only had a month of time and I also needed to use the company's framework. I ended up needing to do a lot of ""hacks"" because the people who wrote the framework didn't have the time to help me out. I would've missed the deadline if I was going to wait for their help.

These are all pretty inconvenient things, but it wasn't the end of the world. The lack of support for newhires was a common occurence during my time at the startup, however. I've seen other newhires using their own laptops for months because the employer didn't manage to get their gear in time.

**Not being allowed to do programming work outside of my job at the startup**

My employer prohibits their employees from doing any paid work related to tech outside of their job. They are however allowed to do anything that isn't related to tech.

This means you cannot make a website for someone else, or launch your own product like a SaaS or an eBook.

For someone with my ambitions this had killed my motivation to code outside of work. Not only did it suck to be less motivated, but this restriction also prevented me from growing faster as a developer because I just ended up spending less time coding outside of work. It also made me less productive at my job.

To be honest, I doubt this is actually enforceable in my North European country, but at the time I did not feel like risking getting fired over it.

Being the ambitious person that I am this however was a good reason for me to start looking for another job. 

**No trust to allow working from home**

Working from home was not allowed. That was fine with me, I wanted to be in the office anyway for face to face mentorship (which I didn't get, more on that later) and to get to know my colleagues. And then Covid-19 happened. We all started working from home fulltime since April.

The Sunday night before we would start working from home we got an email instructing us to install some sort of employee monitoring software on our work laptops. This software measures your activity level throughout the day by monitoring how much you use your mouse and keyboard. I believe this isn't allowed as per the GDPR and it didn't really feel right to me (lack of trust), but the software was also configred to take a screenshot of your desktop every 15 minutes, which essentially made this spyware and this is also a huge violation of the GDPR.

Naturally, some employees made remarks about this and refused to use the software as it a breach of their rights as EU citizens. Our boss claimed their legal counsellor said it was within their right, but it clearly was not. After a lot of debate our employer ended up turning the screenshot feature off, but the message was clear: they did not trust us enough to just do our job and did not respect our privacy.

**Lack of direction**

Management was very poor. For the first year I worked at this startup we weren't even following agile, scrum or similar methodologies. We just had a backlog and a daily ""standup"" meeting with only the developers. That's it.

This ended up being really demotivating because we were just mindlessly going from task to task, without any real idea what was important to the business.

Occasionally someone from management would join the meeting when they had changed their minds about something. This always happened sporadically and without discussing anything with the development team.

**Lack of personal growth, no mentorship**

This startup had multiple small offices. I was under the impression that I would be working with other developers face to face, but that didn't end up being the case. I was the only developer in my office location. I only saw the people I worked on the same project with during the daily standup meeting, which was just a Zoom call.

This wasn't good for my morale, since those other devs were all working in the same office and had a noticably better bond as colleagues. When I was hired it was never mentioned to me that I would be the only dev in my office location.

Ever since finishing that solo project I mentioned earlier I had not really worked on any interesting projects. It was a lot of the same stuff over and over again.

**Working overtime**

When I was in the interviewing process for this company they mentioned that employees are expected to be flexible.

I don't mind working overtime much. Especially at a startup it was to be expected. 

What I did not expect, and what I *do mind,* was that we didn't get compensated for working overtime at all. No pay. No leaving early on another day.

When I worked overtime I asked if I could leave early on another day. My manager said ""we don't do that here. It wouldn't be fair to the others who frequently do a lot of overtime"". When I learned that others do a lot of uncompensated overtime I genuinely felt bad for them. Why would extra work that benefits the company not result in compensation, especially if it occurs frequently? It just does not make sense.

It makes me so angry when employers exploit their employees. These people have families and personal lives too. While they are hard at work during overtime, their managers are just enjoying their spare time. It's disgusting.

The boss always said they're a ""work hard, play hard"" kind of company. I suppose the ""play hard"" part of that generally didn't apply to their engineers.

**No tests**

This company also did not bother to write tests for their code. My first employer also didn't do this, but the work I was doing there was much simpler.

At this startup we worked on SaaS applications which are the main source of income for the company. Not writing tests has many disadvantages as you probably know, but combining this with uncompensated overtime has resulted in some pretty terrible events where bugs that could have been prevented by tests had to be fixed in evenings or weekends without any compensation except a good pat on the back.

The other developers also didn't seem to be interested in writing tests. I had tried to convince them that we needed to at least test some critical things, but those tests probably still don't exist.

**No signs of improvement over time**

By the end of my time at this job the senior developers still didn't have time to help out newhires. Even though they wrote the framework, they also didn't bother writing documentation for it. Things still broke occasionally because there were no tests, resulting in uncompensated overtime. When I left there still weren't any tests.

**Compensation**

My salary was good enough. After leaving the company I noticed that larger companies did generally offer more money and better benefits though.

**My advice for those considering working at a startup**

If you're a junior, be sure to ask how they will mentor you and help you grow. But I would urge you to look for a larger company where they actually have the resources to help you grow.

Most importantly, ask them about things you think are important. I know this sounds obvious, but not being able to make any money outside of my job wasn't obvious when I signed the contract.

**TL;DR**

My experience at a startup has been pretty bad. No respect for the employees, software that screenshots our desktops for employee tracking, no compensation for frequently occurring overtime, poor management, no mentorship, being the only dev in my office location, not being allowed to do my own thing outside of the job, uninteresting projects. 

But hey, at least we had a foosball table.

If you're considering working at a startup, consider this before signing a contract:

* Find a company that *enables* you instead of one that holds you back
* Ask how they manage their projects and if they write tests
* Make sure you get the gear you need when you start the job
* If you want to work from home, ask if that's allowed and how much
* Ask how they will help you get started at the job, if they have employee or developer onboardings etc.
* Know what their overtime policies are
* Consider how much you value a good work life balance
* Ask what kind of work you are allowed to do outside of your job

**What are your thoughts on working at startups? Should juniors consider this at all?**"

I have about 4.5 years of industry experience + an advanced degree, and was expecting that they would ask questions more relevant to the specific area that I’m in.

1. Remote opportunity for my current company. I'm gonna move to my hometown (plus much lower COL), so I'm sure I'll have a good life there. The problem is at this company I don't grow much, the job is boring, the projects have no sight of success. So I'm worried in 1-2 years if I have to leave (some senior guys already planed on quitting), I'll have a hard time of finding new job.

2. A big company. I know they're growing and the scale is massive, so plenty of opportunities to learn. However they're also known for very poor work-life balance. Also it's from the same city and I don't even want to stay here anymore. My plan is to work there 1-2 years maximum to get some experience as well as a name on my CV then quit and move to another place.

Essentially choice 1 is good for my mental health but it's not gonna last long. And choice 2 is tough but I might have a better career. What should I choose?

Also in this covid situation it's hard to find other opportunities. So let's stick to this 2 choices I have."

2569,cscareerquestions,Been working 4 years in the field of academic research. Worried my skills are not developing the way they should be,"My first job out of college has been nice for a lot of reasons — generally low stress, a lot of creative freedom, pay is OK but the benefits are insanely good (best HC I’ve ever seen and a 2x employer match for 401K). 

During my time here I have been one of only two developers on my team. The other developer is nearly impossible to hold a conversation with and almost got himself fired a couple years ago over some unfinished (and extremely important) paperwork. He is disorganized and avoidant, to say the least. Our manager does not have a strong background in software (she cannot write code of any sort, to my knowledge) and our actual research leader is even further from a technical background.

I am getting concerned that my first job out of school has contained basically nothing in the way of mentorship or focused skill development. Nobody looks at my code. The things I build work, but I get this feeling that they’re garbage houses of cards just waiting for a gust of wind to knock them over. The senior programmer supposedly does work with AI — I’ve been super interested as I have a cognitive science background from school, but despite repeatedly inquiring I’ve never gotten a look into any of this work. I suspect (based on other times I’ve gotten a look at his work) that it may not be particularly impressive and he doesn’t want to share it.

Basically, I feel like I have developed new skills, but I have developed many of them to low levels of proficiency rather than developing a few of them to a high level. I’m worried this is going to hamstring my future career prospects by basically forcing me to take an entry level dev role again when I finally find a company that takes the *software* side of things seriously (with my team there is often just as much, or more, emphasis on the actual scientific study that is employing our software tools, which is also cool experience for me but doesn’t help me develop skills I care about).

I’m very new to this sub so sorry if there is like a boilerplate list of advice for me to follow here that I missed out on. I’m just very unsure about this. I have always been my own worst critic, so maybe it’s really not as bad as I think, but I won’t know til I go looking for other jobs, and if I ever want a significant raise in my lifetime I will NEED to leave the organization I’m with...

Has anyone been in a similar situation? I’ve talked to other devs I know IRL and have gotten a lot of raised eyebrows when I describe the types of projects that I’ve built entirely by myself, so I can’t imagine this setup is normal to many people. I love my team and really love the work we do but I’m concerned this is no longer what my career needs."

2575,cscareerquestions,"New grad here, senior engineer I'm working with seems to be condescending. Am I just being a baby?","Few months as a new grad here. I work UI and a guy with 10+ years experience owns the backend for a new project on my team. I interact with him a lot and I feel like I get somewhat of a condescending tone from him that kind of makes me feel not so great about working with him. I'm wondering if this is okay or if I'm just being a big baby.

For example, our backend is complex and uses some new bleeding edge tech. He wrote some documentation about it and I read over it a few times, tried implementing something against it, and got it wrong. I asked him what I did wrong and he said ""It's in the docs, didn't you read it? If I write anything in the docs that means its very important."", which made me feel like an idiot.

Another example is that I sometimes send him a quick message asking a question for help/explanation after I've spent time researching a problem. I get a response maybe 1 out of every 5 messages.

Recently there was a problem with our backend crashing that caused the UI to not load any data, so an alert was raised. He messaged in our group chat, ""I specifically fixed this error in the backend last week and posted here about it, and as well as messaged you directly on how to use the fix."" He never looked into the details of the alert, otherwise he would have seen I already used his fix in the UI and it was another problem on his end. So this just reeked of 'since you didn't read what I sent, go fuck yourself', even though he was wrong.


For what it's worth, my manager is very happy with my work and says I'm knocking it out of the park. These experiences make me very hesitant to ask for help or work with this particular engineer going forward. What should I do about it?"

So, I recently got an offer from a startup in NYC (yay!). I’m excited about the job and compensation, but the PTO being offered is a fraction of what I have at my current job. The other benefits being offered are pretty standard. 

I currently work for a European based company that has an unlimited PTO scheme and actually lets you use a lot of PTO. This is the first company I’ve worked at since graduating, and I think I’ve been a bit spoiled with this. I’m wanting to leave as the pay is no where near what many places in NYC offer (I recently relocated here from the Midwest and work remote) and I’m hoping to get experience in some new areas. I’m not expecting to get the same PTO benefits from an American company, but the offer states that you get 10 PTO days for vacation/sick leave and 6 paid holidays. This seems really low to me.

On my last year of high school, I started my very first business. The business involved writing python scripts that would run on servers hosted on AWS/GC 24/7, to stream a bunch of information directly to our subscribed customers. I did a good amount of revenue with this company, while at the same time really hurting my GPA. Eventually due to ownership issues I decided to leave and start another company within the same niche, but keeping 100% ownership. I basically did the same thing, I used React/Express/Mongo to setup the website and user dashboard, and created more scripts, this time written in Node. This business did good, but not as good as the previous one. Eventually as my classes got harder, running the business and doing class at the same time became harder for me. I took a break, and got my GPA back up to 3.6. This winter I got hired by another ""not real"" (owned by young person, 2-5 person team) company within the niche, as a lead front-end developer. When I first joined the team, I was coding the front end of the desktop application to look like the mockups they had, but I realized that it wasn't really all too nice to began with so I completely redesigned the UI from bottom up. Now its extremly beautiful and something I'm really proud of. The problem is, I have not made a cent from this job over the 6 months I have been doing the work for it, because until we sell copies, theres no payment, and theres still a lot of work left on backend before we can sell copies.  


As I wait for backend work to finish, I've been doing research on looking for and applying for jobs, but I really have no idea where to began with someone with a background like mine.

2594,cscareerquestions,More Responsibility without a Promotion/Pay Raise? Is it normal?,"I've been in my company for a year after graduation. We had a performance review 6 months ago where I got a salary increase in my position (Associate ML dev).

However, recently I was moved from my previous team and was made the team-lead of a previously running project(previous devs were moved to different project) and now am directly responsible for designing solution from ground up, plan and break down tasks among devs, evaluate and review codes and report directly to the project leader. 

I was told by my previous techlead(who I worked with for past year) that they see ""leadership"", ""sound communication skill"" and ""good background knowledge"" in me to put in this position.

But there was no mention of promotion or salary increase. So after a month I contacted the management whether they are planning to reevaluate my compensation explaining my job scope is not there same as it was 6 months ago and I was told that ""budget is done on a yearly basis"" and ""in a year they may assign employees to new roles as an opportunity for them to grow and learn and performance/salary will be evaluated at the end of a year"" so there is no way for a salary increase for now. 

So now I'm stuck with the same pay as my teammates but with 2/3 times more work and stress. Is it common in the industry?"

Biotechnology, or genetic engineering more specifically is one of them, and I'm wondering how a computer science background would play or be beneficial to the field.

From what I've read so far just recently, genetic engineering requires a sufficient amount of knowledge in molecular biology or biophysics, which is not something a CS education can provide (not my university's at least). However, without going on and changing my major I'm wondering if anyone from a biotech or genetic engineer background would be able to tell me if CS plays a substantial role in genetic engineering, or if a background primarily in biology would be required to do some good work?

2600,cscareerquestions,Should I directly address this undermining at work?,"Due to a dysfunctional work place, there was an individual from another team who was part of the project team which didn't understand the technical matters, and so he went to his boss to write an email saying ""We are not doing this because if I am understanding (me) correctly it is prohibitively difficult, and etc..."" Long story short, what he was saying was incorrect.

Which really blindsided me because the entire time, as the main technical person on this project I've been acting as a pseudo-project manager, setting up meetings, trying to make sure we meet our deadlines, incorporating everything, explaining the technical matters. For example, this said individual still is confused on what the target of our project is that we worked on together for a year and that there's been plenty of presentations and discussions on. But I never undermined his analysis or when he outright says something incorrect, because we are a team. I just say, ""Yes adding on to what yadda yadda says, this is \_\_\_"". To continue to promote teamwork.

After the misquoting and the visible undermining of me from the boss, I realized afterwards that whatever he communicated to his boss about what we have been doing was clearly misinformed and underinformed. So when we had a group-wide discussion to talk about it, it was ineffective as the boss wasn't informed about the project and in the end it also made me look bad. The manager had no context to understand the differences between this project and the other project that the manager is overall upset about. 

I had a chance to message the boss separately to clear up some of this miscommunication and clarify some of the original words in the email but I kept it short. So I can only assume he gets a part of it now. I just focused on the immediate miscommunication and the direct undermining and not go into the differences between our project and this other project and why they are different. One mistake that I did do was directly clear up the misquote immediately, and instead I decided to focus on the other technical aspects of the email because I didn't want to add a direct confrontation in my response which I've learned was a bad choice as the manager focused on 'we're not doing something because it was difficult' in our group call. So it was only until after the call, I clarified that this thing is not difficult that it is fairly simple, but the reason why this is such because 1) 2) 3) it isn't good technical practice and should be avoided.

**But this speaks to the wider discussion of, how do I address this moving forward with this team member and should I? Should I send a message to him or just lay my head low as I clarified a few matters with his boss already?** He's been getting very confrontational and aggressive in the group messages about the project as well and doing his hardest to show to his boss that there is a technical problem with the project. So I have been forced to stand up at certain times to defend the work that has been done, and said team member should know about as he is part of the project.

Plus, one thing that overall frustrates me about this culture and I've been realizing from these experiences (and I guess my other technical colleagues have learned already) that it's better not to speak up to make sure technical work is being done correctly. That it's easier to just lay low and just continue performing bad practices. But this is hard to do since because as the technical lead in this project, obviously, I don't want bad work being analyzed to make decisions. Moving forward, I realized to survive in this culture, it's better to just keep your head down, not speak up even if something is incorrect, and just let things continue the way they are. I can do that, and will do so moving forward although it will be hard, but is there anything I should do to address this immediate thing with my coworker. He has been misquoting his misunderstandings to another colleague in the project (other colleague told me this), and the situation still doesn't sit right with me."

2607,cscareerquestions,Looking for some career advice in my last semester,"I'm graduating in December (~3.5 GPA, state school, no internships). I've been working part-time doing web development at the university I'm attending and it's been a great position. But at the end of the day it's web development and I want to work in something more technical (actual software engineering, maybe embedded systems).

So here's my dilemma:

My current position is for students meaning I'll lose it in December. If I have an offer lined up by then that'd be perfect but I haven't even really started applying for positions yet. The department I work for has had some other (non-student) positions open up, and here are my options:

**Option 1 ($15/hr, 28 hours/week)**: Stick with my current job and pray that I have something lined up by December. I could coast on savings for up to a year after graduating if absolutely necessary.

**Option 2 (~$20/hr, 28 hours/week)**: Take a different part-time job in the same department. I've already interviewed for it and it's mine if I want it, *but* on the condition that I don't leave immediately after graduating 4 months from now. I'd be making 25% more than I am now and doing the exact same job, but this means I couldn't line up an offer for right when I graduate (for probably at least a few months).

**Option 3 ($50k/year, full-time)**: Try to get a full-time position in the same department. I've passed the initial screening and am guaranteed at least an interview, but might not get the position. I won't know until after I accept/decline Option #2. If I take it I'd be expected to stay for *at least* a year or two (and I really do not want to be burning bridges here).

Options 2 and 3 are both in web development, but I just have no idea if I can be picky about my position as a new grad from a no-name school during COVID. Lastly, note that I'm living in a low COL state."
2608,cscareerquestions,I never did leetcode and just got a return offer for my internship with a raise,"Just wanted to share my experience for those discouraged by the try-hards of this subreddit telling you to grind leetcode all day.

Anyway, I'm from a decent sized city in the south but I go to college at a small private school in California that no one has ever heard of. I do pretty well at school, I'm in both of our honors programs and have a 3.86 GPA. I like working on Python web scrapers and scripts for myself, but that's about it in the way of personal projects (besides my portfolio site). I did a 6-week internship with my science honors program after freshman year making a full-stack solution to store patient data. But I also do trips with my friends to Mexico, play video games, and go to Disney, i.e. I don't study all the time (or much at all--my CS tests are open book).

Sophomore year a family friend suggested I apply to a defense contractor in my hometown. I did, got an interview, and got an offer to be a software engineering intern making $22.25/hr. The extent of the ""technical"" questions in the interview were 1) what languages are you familiar with 2) what are some projects you've worked on and 3) do you know what agile is. I don't know if there were meant to be more questions, but I answered them so confidently that that's all they asked. $22.25/hr might not be a lot for you California folk, but in my southern town where the cost of living is 62% lower than San Francisco that's pretty dang good.

Anyway, the internship this past summer was great. Spent a lot of time debugging C++ code, writing Python scripts for test automation, and automating our build process. They let me stay on part-time for this semester since my classes are virtual, and I just got a return offer for next summer where they upped my pay to $26.45. Did a coding interview just for kicks the other day and passed with flying colors (no intention of accepting offer though). Also talking to a SpaceX recruiter about a possible position coming up.

2613,cscareerquestions,My job has changed too much too fast for me to keep up. Is it just me?,"Background: I'm a self-taught developer of 20 years, from ""Webmaster"" to front-end developer to full-stack developer. My strongest skills are JS, CSS, and Angular, secondary skills are nodeJS and reactJS.

I started my current role a couple years ago at a very large company. It's not a software company. The department I joined was building one of their first apps, and I had the angular and node skills to greatly accelerate the project, while other team members focused on DB design, deployment pipelines, etc. After that success, I was established as ""high-performing"", and put on a new team to build a new app with React and Java. I made sure everyone knew I had no experience with React, took a crash course and didn't think it would be too big a shift from Angular.

Then the team adopted Redux, which took months to get my head around and I'm still fumbling with it. They decided to use Styled Components, making my CSS knowledge useless. Tons of code has been written around immer and reselect and a pile of stuff I've never seen before. These aren't just libraries, they're new and weird conceptual approaches. I'm constantly struggling to learn enough to complete a small feature. On top of that, I'm now supposed to know how to use Jenkins and Terraform to spin up AWS resources, build docker images, cache them to Artifactory, deploy them to AWS instances, etc. etc. etc. There have been multiple sprints where not a single story is within my skillset. My inability to finish anything is making me anxious and depressed, which makes it hard for me to even start a task. Rinse and repeat.

Does this sound familiar to anyone else? Is it an industry shift? Or have things always moved at this pace, and I'm getting old and slow?"

2620,cscareerquestions,"To an extent, easy/some medium LC can make you a better engineer","Let me say upfront that LC is still a shit way to hire people specifically because companies will throw absurd LC mediums or LC hards at candidates, and knowing neat little tricks to solve those problems does nothing to benefit you as an engineer in my opinion.

That being said, if you're just starting out on LC, or haven't yet, I know there's a lot of debate still on the value of LC so I figured I would share my experience. Keep in mind I am very cynical of LC in general and am still mostly anti-LC.

Despite the above, it seems like almost every day I use string manipulation at work. In the context of LC, this could be ""hey here's an array of chars, convert it to a string and get rid of the non-letters"". So you join the chars together and use regex to shed all the non-letter characters of the string. Perhaps you need to split a string, lower case it, whatever. In some way, you need to take a raw string and do some shit with it. Any LC problem concerning that is pretty damn useful because it teaches you how to manipulate strings. Will I ever need to check if a string is a palindrome? Fuck no lol. Trivial LC anyway but stuff like that will probably never come up. However, knowing the various string methods and how to use them is very helpful, and a lot of LC easy problems force you to learn them.

The reason I say some medium LCs is due to how often I'm working with an XML document object at work, which is basically a tree data structure, and I'm having to manipulate the nodes, navigate to parent nodes, child nodes, etc. Am I doing DFS or BFS? No. When I do parentNode.SelectSingleNode(""nodename"") though, I'm willing to bet a lot of money it's doing DFS or BFS under the hood though to find the child node with that name. Being comfortable with trees if nothing else is helpful to navigate through them.

So to summarize, with how LC is used in hiring, it's fucking stupid. However, anyone should be able to do the easier LC problems because they will force you to get better at programming in order to solve them. My 2 cents, you can say they have no value, I don't care. Just offering another data point to the discussion. :D"

However this has posed a dilemma for me in terms of the next steps in my career.

My original plan was to take on another internship next Summer 2021 and hopefully transfer that into a full time offer at its completion provided I perform to the companies expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi all,

This sub has been a huge help in the past, so I thought I'd come here with a question that's been bugging me for a little while.

I am in the last few weeks of a coding bootcamp, and I think it's gone really well. I do well on assignments, which test our abilities on a variety of things, and I've done quite well on CodeWars (which is similar to LeetCode, for those who aren't familiar). I'm no expert programmer who's drawing up paradigm shifting algorithms, but I think I've proven myself to pretty proficient and a quick learner.

However, I've been applying to jobs in advance of finishing, and I've been pretty discouraged by the expectations listed in a lot of entry level roles. How on earth can one be expected to even know a little bit of all of these languages and frameworks, let alone be proficient?

I understand that I'm not going to apply to a job and just expect an offer. I've set my own internal math to expect that, for every 50-60 jobs I apply to, I'll get maybe one interview. But I am not sure how I am supposed to get a single interview with the expectations. Have others in here been able to find jobs where they didn't meet the requirements? Are they usually overstated? Or should I buckle down and learn a lot more?

Thanks in advance for any feedback."

Issue is these engineers are like machine guns with their jargon and I just nod and feel stupid. I feel that I frustrate them by asking them to explain things and I only have short windows of time to talk to them.

Then they straight up told me that they wouldn't feel comfortable offering any less than 105k. I was fucking floored. Just knowing that I could move to a new company and make 1.5x my salary was mindblowing.

So, now I've had my eyes open. How the hell do I keep myself motivated to continue doing a good job at my current company? I've obviously submitted my CV to the other company as well, but until I get started with the interview process, it just feels like a struggle to *want* to work."

2634,cscareerquestions,Does working with low-bid contracting companies ruin engineering for anyone else? Wondering what life is like without it.,"Recently I’ve finished my *n*th project in which a company I work for decided to (once again) staff from one of the 4 big lowest-bidder contracting companies in the world to build a product. To put it bluntly, it’s pushed me to a tipping point of really just loathing having to ever do it again and am either considering starting my own company, moving into a smaller startup or changing careers. 

Besides the obvious factors for hating outsourcing/“bulk” contracting, I just find it depressing/soul-sucking all around. Their own company treats them like slaves, over half of them seem to have barely any education (or “pretend” to be dumb to not have to work), no one gives a shit about anything, the average rate we pay ends up insultingly being 30% **above** what we would pay a full-time employee, their company consistently swaps people out because of bullshit “personal issues” and they always require hiring an army of people because it’s both their business model and due the lack of actual education/experience/caring. 

It’s disheartening to watch everything go to shit because the execs want to pump their stocks instead of adding long term, sustainable value, so they resort to the modern day version of slave labor. I don’t want to be a part of it anymore.

**My question is:** Are there places that actually value high-performing product engineers (besides FAANG)? Or have most places digressed to shit in/shit out to play the Wall Street lay-off/outsource stock pump game?"

2641,cscareerquestions,My less than perfect journey as a Software Engineer,"This is my journey... from my start as a young student to the miseries of job hunting and my current state of affairs.

It began in 2014 when I started college as a CS major. Everything started quite well: excited, full of hope, and ready to learn. I was always a rather smart kid. I started with really good grades, making the president's list most semesters. Then I met this girl. We hit it off, things were great. Foolishly, we decided to get married during my second year of college against the advice of my parents. But only six months later, I found out that she was cheating on me. The whole thing took a toll on my emotional health and my grades started to slip. I decided to take some time off of school to clear my head and finalize the divorce. So I ended up graduating a year later than I was supposed to.

I graduated in Spring 2019, and the job hunt began. My GPA was not too bad being 3.5, but I had no internships. Despite applying at countless places, I barely got any interview. Under parental and self-imposed pressure, I started to look for non-programming jobs. I got offered a job at a ADP for 52K. as an implementation specialist.. but for some reason (maybe they found a more experienced candidate), the recruiter told me that due to some internal issues, they would freeze hiring at the location until further notice.

That was a major setback, but the worse was yet to come. I started to apply everywhere again. Even at places that I was trying to avoid badly: WITCH companies and even Revature. I talked to a few other their recruiters and was even offered a ""position"" at Revature. I declined due to their stringent contract. 

Finally, a company called Mphasis which is like slightly better than Revature offered me SWE position at 55K with location after training. We are now in July 2019, and I was supposed to start on October 7th. I need to mention that at the time I also had a server job from which I was making reasonable money.

So I put in my 2-week notice and was ready to go. But a week before starting the SWE job, the recruiter called and told me that for some BS reasons (they didn't want to cut off training for the holiday season), we would start in January 2020 instead. So now I left my job and I had to wait another 3 months to start my new ""job"". But I somehow believe them.

Since I had some savings I decided to just stay home, studying up and improving my skills. However, a week again before I started in January, I received an email saying that the training would not start on time again and this time they had no idea when things would resume. Needless, I got really mad and felt like I was cheated of 6 months of my life for nothing.

I became even more desperate and I was willing to take anything that came my way. I even recontact the Revature people and they said yes. I only had to move 60 miles for training and I had some savings so I was not too concerned about being able to take care of things during training. For anyone who don't know, revature is literally the bottom of the industry, they prey on the weak and desperate, paying 8/hr during training, charging 120 per week for housing, 45K a year with a two-year contract, and 36K fee for breaking the contract.

Their training was rough. We had to learn a plethora of technologies within two months: java, sql, the spring framework, hibernate, angular, and much more. Even though I dislike everything about this company, I must say their training was really good. I learned more from them in three months than I did in my entire college years. Many of the kids I started with could not finish the program.

So I started in February with Revature, but the Coronavirus hit hard around mars. Although training continued from home, most of us got furloughed within two weeks after training. To be honest, being furloughed is the best thing that could have happened. 

So again with the job hunt, I started applying everywhere again. But this time, thanks to Revature's training, I felt more secure about my skills. And my resume was attractive to employers. I first received an offer from TCS (Witch compnay) for 65K with no contract. I took it but I really disliked the idea of being a consultant, with the risk of having to move anywhere around the country.

I started with them about a month ago. But I also had other applications out. I received another offer from a local company for 55K, which I rejected but I was still not satisfied with TCS. 

I finanlly received another offer from General Motors. Even though the salary is slightly lower than TCS. I decided it was the best offer for me. The annual bonus, 9% raise per year (first 3 years), the amazing benefits on top of not being a consultancy company made it the right choice for. Now I am in the process of leaving TCS for GM. Hopefully, things work out. 

So yeah, this was my story. A year and half after graduating... I am still trying to find my place in the industry. Along the way, I learned a lot. Hopefully, sharing my experience can help others and provide some hope to those who are like I was desperate to get a job."

2645,cscareerquestions,What is the job title for someone who deals with issuing the publishing certificates for apps?,"Background: I was hired by this company to do dev work, but they catfished me and now I’m doing mostly app support and IT busy work. It’s killing my career but I’m just holding out until I finish my masters in December. It’s a paycheck and 6 figures plus retirement and benefits. Recently I’m trying to reposition myself and the specific role I’m in after a full management change. I’m swimming upstream though as the new management is just dumping more support work down my throat since the rest of the staff has interpreted my role as just that from the previous management. 

Question: Under which role does the issuance of certificates for publishing apps, administering cloud UAC and playing go-fer with vendors for API access fall under? 

This is literally the most obnoxious set of tasks I’ve ever done. But if they want to pay me 6 figures for it, fine. What should I be looking for in terms of my next gig if this is my experience? Business Systems Analyst? Project Manager? Product Manager? Release Manager? What?

All of those are completely disparate to my education. I’ve also never seen job requirements looking for people who have experience with shuffling dev certificates and administering users on Apple Developer Console. I know these are trivial tasks, and likely have been automated away by CI/CD suites years ago. This company is about 3 decades behind the rest and 90% of headache day to day is not having the right tools to do anything followed by 30 year legacy of people using personal emails for this stuff and then getting themselves fired or walking out and not leaving behind the keys, so to speak. What really sucks is this is all to support a different product team who is having the engineering work done by a vendor. Is a complete dumpster fire. 

I’m just hoping that somewhere in my time at this dump will offer me some transferable experiences to help me acquire a new role someplace better.

Any ideas?"

2647,cscareerquestions,What are the best languages to focus on for a career in Software Engineering / Data Science?,"Hi there,

(Also posted in learnprogramming as wasn’t sure which was the best forum!) 

I’ve recently completely an undergraduate degree in the UK and I’ve found a real interest in computer science due to having some work experience and seeing a data scientist and a software engineer show me their work. 

Due to this I reckon I will undertake a masters in Computer Science as those job roles are very interesting to me!

My main question is - are there any particular languages I should focus on for those fields (maybe data science more as I know software engineering can be broad)? 

I’ve been spending some time learning Python, using some LinkedIn learning / Udemy courses and I was wondering what would be the next best one when I feel ready to move on.

Any resources would also be great, whether it’s for python or any recommended languages.

Thank you so much!"
2648,cscareerquestions,Transitioning from student to developer,"I just started my final semester at university and will be graduating in December with a degree in software development. With graduation on the horizon, my stress levels are going through the roof.

To put it to you straight... I feel like I just didn't learn enough in my courses. I learned programming fundamentals with python (course project was creating an atm simulator), learned algorithms and data structures with c# (created tic tac toe and battleship), learned how to design and manage projects, learned a small amount MySql, and few other very basic things. To be completely honest, I didn't do a lot programming outside of school because I was working a 45 hours a week from the start of freshman year up until a month ago. During this past month that I've had off, I have been focused on creating programs for my portfolio. Right now all I have is a WPF app that allows the user to add, edit and delete friends from a MySql database. I learned a lot from making this program, probably more than I learned in the past 3 years of school. I understand that it is a lot easier to learn while building something, but why did I spend 2 semesters in school learning a bunch algorithms, yet never actually being shown when or why we'd use them in an actual program. For example, I can create a linked list and manipulate it, but I have no idea why I would or when to do it in a program. I guess what I want to know is: Is it normal to feel this way at this stage in my journey? Does my school just suck? Did I not do enough outside of school? Do I know more than I think I know? I am just completely lost right now.

Any advice or feedback is greatly appreciated, and I can clarify more in the comments."

Let's set interest aside for a moment. I am in my late 20s making decent money (\~100k) for the mid-size city I live in. While I can possibly help out with some IoT projects at my current company I would likely have to jump ship to find full time work in something CS centric.

One of the main things I like though is the work-life balance it provides me, being 2minutes on foot from home, and working about 4hr per day in normal business hours / low demand. But the payment is mediocre.

My goal is to land a remote abroad job to the USA or Europe because my currency here is undervalued a lot. I have been using my spare time since the pandemic started to study and prepare myself for interviews and tests. But I got say I was mildly disciplined only...

After some ""no""s gotten from trying the waters doing international interviews, I decided to try some from my country for practice. I refused 2 positions that I got doing that, but the 3rd one offered a 50% raise, which was a lot more than I expected I could make here. Still not as much as 150% that I would get from a 20$/h position, but still.

But from what I have seen, their culture is Go Horse, and I would have to work 44 hours per week instead of 40 hours. Also, it is an outsourcing company. But I like their technology better (React, with some .Net core, vs my current with Angular).

I told my manager, and they gave a counteroffer to stay for 15% more. Still, the other offer is 33% more.

So...

* Should I go horse?
* Should I even though my end goal is to work abroad which would let me make a lot more?
* Considering I have more free time and more energy from my current place, would I be lying to myself that I could get some contract jobs to fill the income gaps of that offer until I get a full-time remote position?
* I'm fine with either Angular or React, but should I focus on one, I would pick React, which makes me think it would be a waste still working 4h per day with Angular still...

2664,cscareerquestions,How do I get the fuck out of software development?,"I have been in the field in some capacity for over a dozen years now. I have come to the conclusion that I just can't take a career in software anymore. Here is why:

- The dystopian interview process: its not enough to speak to your experience and your potential value to the company to get hire like almost all other white collar jobs. You have to do riddles, free labor, white board performances, and a gauntlet of other tasks that takes weeks of study

- The assembly line: modern scrum/agile has transformed software development into an assembly line. Every bit of your work is estimated, tracked, reported on, and presented all under the cloak of micromanagement and some of us have been convinced that this is a good thing.

- The working conditions: long hours, crunch time, doing multiple jobs on 1 salary, on call, most (or all depending) of this has become the norm

- The outsourcing: I just don't mean H1B and overseas outsourcing either. I mean countless bullshit ""contractor to hire"" jobs that litter the industry with less benefits and salary. All this is somehow accepted and legal. When was the last time human resources was ""contract to hire"" for example?

I need to get out, but I don't know where to pivot to. I just can't take this shit anymore, the quality of life of this industry has taken a sharp nose dive from when I first started.

2679,cscareerquestions,Thinking about taking a few months off,"I'm just thinking out loud here, but comments and advice would be appreciated. 

I'm a mid-career full stack developer with about 15 years of experience in full time, non-contract roles. I've been at my current job for 6+ years and I hate it. My team has shrunk significantly, there is no management structure to speak of, a lot of my day-to-day tasks are not using modern tech, and the tech skills I actually desire are stagnating. I would call myself average as a senior level developer, but I generally keep my customers and boss happy. I have a lot of trouble motivating myself to pursue new opportunities, even though I want one, so that is something I need to deal with.

My partner has a real career with lots of advancement opportunities, and makes more money than I do. We are both working from home right now, and both of our elementary age kids are in the school's virtual learning program through at least October. Our youngest had a very difficult time last semester with home schooling, and is at risk of falling behind. We have other temporary situations in our life causing stress right now, both related to COVID and not. It is very difficult to work from home while your kids are being educated at home.

In an ideal world, I would figure out what is holding me back from aggressively interviewing for new jobs, and then do it. I don't think this is a good idea right now, mostly because we need extra help running our household. If I get a new job, I would need to spend the next several months completely focused on establishing myself in my new role.

So, we're discussing me taking a few months off work to keep the kids on task at school, and cover some of the household chores that we are falling behind on. The plan is for me to set up a temporary workspace in my kid's room to help and motivate him throughout the day.

I used to keep a pretty active GitHub profile, but it has been a year since I've done any significant work. My plan is to work on two new side projects to get me back on track with my tech skills, and maybe start working towards AWS certifications. I generally don't think certifications have any value, but AWS is a skill I don't have, and I'd like to be able to prove that I used my time off productively. I missed out on a decent job last year because they make heavy use of AWS.

I think if I come up with a cheeky ""job title"" on my LinkedIn profile that explains the situation, and showcase some recent work that I did during this time, I should be able to find a job when the kids go back to school. Theoretically, this doesn't sound too hard, but I'm generally resistant to change, and it gives me a bit of anxiety.

Financially, we'll be fine if we cut out discretionary spending. One of my favorite things about the life we've built is that I rarely have to think about money, and that attitude will have to be put on pause for a while if I do this.

I'd like to make a final decision by the end of this week, so if I quit my job, I'll be done with it before school starts. Any thoughts are welcome."
2680,cscareerquestions,Total career change - bachelors or masters route?,"Sigh... 

Have a bachelors in psychology. Don’t know a whole lot of math but have been wanting to learn math so I don’t mind starting from the bottom. 

Was gonna go to school this Fall for a second bachelors in compsci. I was accepted but I’m at a sudden standstill because financial aid did not give me a whole lot for the total year. I’d have shell out a small portion of the bill per semester if I want to be a full time student. Getting a bachelors in compsci will take me 3 years.

I’m starting to wonder if I should be going the bachelors route now. I am currently unemployed so I don’t really want to pay a whole lot out of pocket. They mentioned I could take out private loans but I honestly think it’s too late for that at least for this semester.

With all that being said, SHOULD I be doing a second bachelors if I want to get into compsci or no? I’m lost now.

2681,cscareerquestions,Do you get to do lower level programming in an AI/Data Scientist role ever?,"I am a Senior college student trying to decide on a career path out of college. 

I am fascinated by AI/ML topics but they feel a bit dense on the math/stats, and there is tons of abstraction in high level programming which im not really a fan of.

i also love lower level programming in C. For those of you who work in AI, do you ever get a chance to write normal or lower level programs for work, or is it mostly strictly data analysis/high level programming?"
2682,cscareerquestions,Taking a pretty bad job offer,"I’m a recent CS graduate (spring 2020) from a top 10 CS program. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to get much internship experience before graduation, so I had trouble finding a job. In the end, though, I found a role as a junior software developer at a small company in my city. However, the salary is pretty low ($70-75K) and the ratings from employees about nepotism, the company being disorganized, etc. are pretty harsh. I mostly took it because I need a job to get experience and move on, and because I finally got an offer after almost a year of looking.

I know I’m only a junior dev, but I could be doing a lot better. Most of my peers are making double my salary straight out of college, so I probably need to step my game up. I plan to continue to study for interviews for bigger and better companies (who will hopefully start responding to my applications after 6 months). 

I do feel somewhat guilty for taking a job offer I know I will have to leave soon because it’s not exactly what I want, but I basically had to settle. So far everyone seems nice, and I do think that this is a good role for me provided the extensive training. However, if I don’t see some sort of big promotion that vastly increases my already comparatively low salary and good opportunities for growth, I’ll have to leave very soon. So what do y’all recommend as a course of action so I can meet my goals smoothly?"

2684,cscareerquestions,Switching jobs for a 3rd time to be back at the company I originally left. Should I do it or not?,"Sorry if this sounds like I’m “boasting” but we are in a huge, growing industry at a great time, people want to hire us.

Background: I’m 3 years out of school.

tl; dr

I’m on my third job and want to go back to my first job (they made an offer to bring me back).

Company A(startup) I was at (loved it, first job) ran out of money, left after &gt;~1.5 years; went to another startup (B), 30% pay increase, terrible tech/people/biz, hated it, left after 4 months; now I’m at a big corporate place (C), cool/new/relevant tech, 10% pay raise, lots of Corp BS, lots of legacy bad code, huge company, super boring work. Basically, I want to go back Company A but I’m worried about my resume and general credibility moving forward in my career.

Long Version

I’m extremely tempted to go back to a company (A) I left not more than a year ago and I’ve had 2 jobs since. They basically ran out of money and I didn’t like missing paychecks all the time so I left, along with most of the company. Now they have come back, with almost all of the issues fixed, with more money (merged with another company and 18-24 months of runway), and offered me more than my current salary plus my options back and more, with my old vesting period, like I never left. The tech is really fun to work on and since it’s small, I have a huge amount of autonomy and decision making power. I still have 2 friends/co-workers and stayed in touch with them and they say it’s way better now and they enjoy the work much much more.

The second company (B) I was at had a terrible dev environment and had some major cultural issues, mostly team leads (all 3 of them), didn’t get along and it make for a terrible work environment. On top of that, the tech they used was very poorly done and they took a lot of short cuts and it’s was so hard to maintain. I left after four months to go to the next job.

Company three (C) were I’m currently at is fine. It’s a large, well respected company with a lot of new, fun tech, with a lot of bad, old tech written by contractors years ago. The work is just boring. The people are pretty good, but there are clearly a lot of politics happening and it bothers me. But either way it’s a very safe job, with great benefits and a great paycheck.

I really have no idea how to answer this question. I don’t hate my job now, it’s fine, just boring and corporate and will look fantastic on a resume. However this old company is so much more fun. Yeah there’s things that suck about startups, but those problems are so much more fun to work on than the basically endless meetings I have to do everyday at my job. I also don’t want my resume/LinkedIn to be a mess. As it stands now, I’m set up pretty well. I get inquires a few times a week for jobs so I’m less worried about having a job, more just like how it looks.

I really do want to go back, but the job path A-&gt;B-&gt;C-&gt;A I think will look really bad.

Any thoughts on this would be great."

2688,cscareerquestions,Undergrad student completely unaware of where to apply! HELP!,"Hello everyone,

This post might get long, really sorry for that. I am currently an Undergrad student in his third year double majoring in Computer Science and Data Science. As the data science/analyst field is quite ambiguous, it's getting very difficult for me to figure out any career path. For eg. I always feel that I need to know something more to apply anywhere OR I find various job postings/internships with the same name BUT with a HUGE variety of pre-requisites/skills.

Honestly, this is making me quite mad and I am completely lost as to what I need to do now. I am not sure if this is the best way to go about it but my life cant seem to move anymore. So, below I have tried to put out a complete list of what I have majorly learnt at my university, course-wise. This list is obviously not exhaustive but I tried to include most of the seemingly important stuff.

So, I want to know what should I learn more before applying for internships (preferable role Data analyst)? Did I even learn anything significant? What kind of roles do I seem to be eligible for?

For the data analyst role, how should I begin? I have applied to many places (around 50) and haven't had a great experience with that. Is ""contacting nearby startups and asking for analyzing their data just for learning"" a viable strategy to break in the field?

2689,cscareerquestions,"Anyone with first hand knowledge, can you explain how referral processing works at your company?","I haven't found anything on here that really goes into the mechanics of referral handling in tech companies. 

I'm probably not the only one curious, but I was wondering how some companies process applications that come from referrals, and how that differs from standard applications. I realize this process can vary from company to company, but even specific examples would be enlightening. 

Some things I am wondering in particular:

How do referrals jump you ahead in the queue?

Are there two completely separate pipelines and therefore separate pools, one for standard apps and one for referrals? If so, is the rate of processing (e.g. 10 apps per day) the same for both pools or is the rate proportional to the size of the pool (e.g. if standard pool has 100 applications, rate = 10 per day, if referral pool has 10 applications, rate = 1 per day)?"
2690,cscareerquestions,Should I focus on JUST frontend coding to break into the web dev field?,"As a budding, unemployed dev, I've been thinking about **focus** lately.

It seems all too common for new devs to scatter their CS studying *everywhere*. And I've been guilty of that. Eventually, after realizing my sin of unfocus, I decided I wanted to be a web dev.

Though, I'm now wondering if I should sharpen that focus to an *even* *more* narrow focus in *just* **frontend coding**. I eventually want to be a **full stack dev**, but if I want to get my foot in the door, it might be better to stick with just frontend at first so I can become decent at a single domain, quickly, rather than spreading myself too thin by focusing on both front and backend and slowly becoming mediocre at each.

Is there any good logic to my train of thought?"

Also any tips or advice is welcome for someone just starting their research into this career field. Thanks!"
2692,cscareerquestions,How should I quit my internship?,"Hi, I am a sophomore in India pursuing B.Tech. in IT. This summer a senior at my uni offered me an internship at his cousin brother's company for image detection and processing. Though I didn't know much about how ML does implement CNN, I said yes to it because I felt flattered to be even considered (my first mistake, I think) and in India, for a first year to get an internship is rare and a big thing. 
I was given a week to learn about tensorflow and keras and I did. I spend that week in June religiously in learning how to implement CNN using tensorflow. I was given a few tasks for the next 2 weeks which I completed satisfactorily. 
Come July, (the part I wasn't aware of) time to implement CNN on a Raspberry Pi. This was totally not my strength but I was intrigued (again to mention this was an internship from a senior which was totally informal and no stipend) so I thought to try it out. July was a stressful month, I struggled to deliver results and even felt bad about it. I felt I was slogging in our project(there were 3 others in the same internship). 
I think today is my breaking point. I don't want to do it. Online lectures have now begun and it's hectic, really hectic. 
The internship will go on for another month. Should I persevere? I fear leaving in between will affect how my senior thinks about me. How should I end it?"
2693,cscareerquestions,Transitioning from junior developer to devops?,"I'm in a tough spot at work that I don't need to get too far into as you all can probably assume what's going on based on the state of this country.

I've been on the job hunt for about a full week now looking for new roles, it's... Been tough, even for it being a week in. I don't come from a traditional background and I nailed my job by 50% luck and 50% working my ass off as an intern to learn the domain. I don't come from a traditional cs background, I learned to be a web developer first and foremost and not a computer scientist and don't have a bachelor's, only an associate's

So I lack a lot of algorithm skills and low level problem solving. 

Where I am good at is high level architecture, knowledge of tools, deployments, database and DB design, I run workshops regularly on TDD for my team and push heavily for it in my department, and I love coding and learning all sorts of languages, but not algorithms. 

I'm thinking about making the transition to devops. I understand it's harder, they want more out of you, the pay ceiling is lower than software devs, but the skillet seems to align more with the way I think and the things I enjoy in this career.

I'm thinking about making this jump, has anyone here made the jump like this? What skills should I make sure I have in the bag ready to go if I want to make this jump?"
2694,cscareerquestions,I feel out of my league as a junior engineer. What kind of work are you recent grads doing?,"I graduated in December and have been working full time since February, and the majority of the time has been WFH. I interned at this company last summer and basically just worked on debugging and improving internal tools. Ever since I started full-time though the work has felt like too much for me. 

In the first couple months I was just working on UI issues, business logic fixes, stuff like that. At most, it would take a week to come up with some sort of code solution.

The past few months though  I have been tasked with some defects that require deeper knowledge that I don't feel like I could possibly have yet. 

For example, the project I am currently working on is a defect that begins with ""Steps to reproduce this issue are unknown"". The whole application crashes due to some out of memory exceptions. It was passed off to me by a senior engineer who has a ton of other stuff on his plate. Basically he told me, our software has a memory leak that is being exposed by some 3rd party software our customers use.

I really try to bring solutions to the table instead of problems so I've spent the past week two weeks just learning about memory leaks, memory dumps, and tools to analyze this kind of stuff, but I've made no real progress on the issue. The other engineers are super helpful and will answer all my questions, and take my meeting requests and such, but I feel like I'm running into hurdles at every step along the way, so I just have more questions and it feels to me like I'm asking other people to do my job. It feels like I'm missing some sixth sense that other engineers have which tell them what approach to try next.

To top it off, the manager that hired me AND his manager got laid off because of Coronavirus, so my new manager is a guy I've met twice IRL. As if it wasn't already difficult enough as a junior to reach out and get the resources and help I need.

\*\*TL;DR: Got hired, manager got fired, projects I'm given feel too hard, spend way too long reading and don't make progress on actual projects\*\*

2698,cscareerquestions,Leave current job (and forfeit bonus) for senior position + more base salary?,"Hi!  


**TLDR;** Current job has a bonus that will vest soon, but a new opportunity has presented itself with senior position (what I always wanted) + higher base salary. If I leave current job, I give away my bonus. Not much immediate elevation opportunities within the current company. 

I'm in a situation where I have a job with a base salary (about 100k) + yearly discretionary bonus (about 17k). I'm about a month out from completing my first year at this company, so the bonus will ""vest"" in at least a month from now. My area of work is related to research/engineering in AI/ML. 

The problem is, I'm working on a starter-intermediate position, in a very small team. I am qualified for a more advanced intermediate-senior position, and I have leadership skills, experience, and the drive to work with people. However, the way my current company is structured its not possible to grow there, and eventually have a leadership position within my own team. I'd either have to create my own team, or switch jobs. Although my boss' boss agreed and liked my leadership position pitch, I still don't see it happening anytime soon (company has financial troubles as well). 

My understanding is that why should I waste another 6 months to a year to elevate to a leadership position at my current company, when I can interview somewhere else and get a team lead position right away?

I'm currently under process of interviewing for a company which is willing to offer me 120k (base salary) with added bonuses + stocks.

However here's where I'm confused. If I leave my current company, without actually getting the bonus in had (which usually happens late in the year even for vested bonuses), they will most probably deny my bonus (of about 17k). But joining this new company bumps up my base salary by more than that amount. 

Do you think it makes financial sense to leave 17k on the table, to move to another position, where you have a more senior role, a team to lead (my dream always), or stay at my current company, collect my bonus (hopefully, if the financial troubles don't last, because if they do, they might still refuse to give bonuses anyway), and keep scouting for more opportunities OR wait for my elevation within the company?

Would love to hear your opinions on this."

I am very introvertic (is this a word?) person. I talk to people gladly, but often I sound too awkward thus people rarely like me. I believed that when I will be working as a programmer, this issue would not bother me that much. But now I see that colleagues start to avoid me, do not invite me to table tennis anymore, and talk shit behind my back. I have done nothing wrong, am just sitting there, doing my tickets, but still I feel very tense while being there, like, I have to watch every single sentence I say so people would not view me as a weirdo.

2702,cscareerquestions,Unpaid internship at big multinational company (not FANG) or below average pay at a small company (not a tech startup),"I (21M) am a fresh computer science grad. In my region, there is no minimum wage or internship culture and most jobs ask for at least 1-2 years of experience. What few internships there are, are all unpaid ones.

I have been interning at a big multinational firm (in data science) (non FANG) for a month now and while the experience I am gaining is pretty good, the work is very demanding and actually contributes to the service the company provides to clients (not ""intern projects"") and is unpaid. The fact that it is unpaid made me continue applying to jobs even after starting. 

Its a 3 months internship with a CHANCE of them hiring me based on my performance and ""many other factors"" (of which they won't elaborate). I am anxious about this because I could perform really well and they may not hire me due to lack of budget or maybe just get some new interns for more free labor tbh. 

I interviewed with a couple of places recently and am expecting a job offer soon. One of the companies said they like my profile but their budget for the job is pretty low - its 30 % lower than what would be considered decent average pay in my region for a backend dev role.

What should I do ? Stick with the big company in hopes of it panning out and getting a lucrative job offer in the future (lucrative since its a big company) or lower my salary expectations and get whatever job I can.

I live with my parents atm and don't need the money to survive for the time being at least."
2703,cscareerquestions,There's a lot of things wrong with this RISE program...and I don't like it. I want to drop out,"I needed to vent about my current dilemma. 

So, I basically got accepted into the rise program, which is great however I'm starting to have some doubts. 

There are 28 members, about 5 or 4 cities to choose from and 4 people will be picked from their 6  team members. 

I took it upon myself to see where my competitors were coming from and I have to say that I'm skeptic about this whole thing. They paired me with a lot of heavy, skilled people with experience and others groups consisted of a well balanced team. Simply put: I feel kind of underqualified in a way or like this isn't really the internship that I should go after. I barely have a resume aside from the IT internship that I've done and since then, I've gotten defensive about why I was chosen in the first place. I don't like to feel as if I was placed in programs or jobs where I'll play as a buffer of some sort, or like when the choosing is gets tough, it'll be easy to knock the lower experienced people out of the way.

When I looked up one of the main reasons why RISE programs were created, apparently such things were created in order to make sure people with smaller knowledge would be able to be taught  throughout the program. Though the program only lasts for 4 days. So it's quite obvious that they really want us to flex our skill more than actually give a little and learn a little, then she who adjusts better. 

I just don't feel too good about this. I'm more offended than I am worried or scared."

2705,cscareerquestions,Software Engineer VS Software Automation Engineer,"Been applying to jobs since graduating in May, and seem to be making strides close to an offer as a Software Automation Engineer. My professional background so far has been Full Stack jobs, and I consider myself a valuable Software Engineer. Based on my knowledge however, the general understanding of Software Automation is that it is closer to IT and less to Software Engineering.

It seems this job would be ""half programming, half UI work"" (with their pre-built UI framework, no code). One concern would be that by taking this role, it wouldn't look good on a resume going forward for normal SE jobs. Another concern is that by taking this role, if I stay with this company, I will be pigeonholing myself into only being able to grow into IT roles and salaries, instead of SE roles and salaries.

Are there hiring managers who could weigh in at all on what ""Software Automation Engineer"" means to you on a resume, or current Software Automation Engineers right now who could weigh in on this situation?"

2708,cscareerquestions,Advice for an established BA curious about Data Analytics boot camp,"I’m really interested in feedback from people in the industry on whether it’s worthwhile for me to pursue some additional skills/certifications via boot camp or whether I would be throwing my money away. 

Currently, I’m an IT Business Analyst for a government entity. I have about 5 years of experience in this type of work. I come from a liberal arts educational background and kind of fell into BA work by chance, then found out I really liked it. I routinely conduct trainings/perform QA work/create resource materials for end users/design workflows/gather requirements and write use cases/user stories/etc. I have experience working in Agile. However, my tech skills are still a weak spot. I work alongside other BAs from programming/development backgrounds and I’m envious of their technical hard skills. 

I’ve been reading more about Data Analytics and it interests me. I like the idea of taking a mass of data and using tools to draw out useful information. I’m looking at a boot camp program through Rutgers with a Data Science track that purports to set you up with the tech skills you need to work as a Data Analyst. My question is, are companies looking for BAs who can also function as Data Analysts? And as a somewhat experienced BA with new Data Science skills, could I expect a salary jump that would make the boot camp cost worth it? For reference, my current job will top out under six figures. If I’m promoted to the next highest BA title, which won’t happen super soon but probably would eventually, I can expect to top out at low six figures. 

If the cost of the boot camp was lower, I would dive in just to acquire the skills and expand my repertoire, but at almost 12k I would need to know the course boosted my earnings potential for it to be a reasonable investment. 

Thanks for any feedback you can provide."

I read a comment that basically said he actually actively tried to avoid scrum and that it promotes micromanagement and stuff.

I’ve worked in both scrum and kanban environments, albeit only as an intern, but my work was tracked along with everyone else’s.

Personally, I think I can say that I felt more pressure to deliver in scrum, because of the two week timeline, but it didn’t feel so overbearing because our team was fluid enough to just push things into the next sprint if issues came up.

Kanban felt a ton more flexible and I only start to feel the crunch when someone else, like PO or stakeholder ish, starts to ask about it.

Is there a larger pattern of micromanagement in scrum that I’m not aware of, that would make it advisable in any capacity to actively avoid working in scrum teams?"
2716,cscareerquestions,Never enough experience...,"Hello, 
This is a rant / asking for advice. I have around 1 year and 8 months of ""professional"" experience; I ended up taking a contract role which was a thin veiled W2 role in reality. The company I was contracted to was public and pretty big and I ended up working with the same engineering team the entire tenure. I am struggling a lot to find a position, from internship to mid level. 

I have a hunch that it is because my stint at this contracting firm, and that most recruiters don't see the company as ""Legitimate"". It's sketchy foresure; but at this point I don't know what to do. I have a side-business (project) which is a service that users actually use and we make a bit of money from it, but not enough to sustain myself. I have experience with AWS/React/Node/JS/C++/Java ; but it always seems like it is not enough for companies. 


Always this same sentence every time, ""Sorry, but your experience does not fit this role at this time"" it's so demoralizing; and just makes me wonder what else can I do, besides work on side projects constantly. I reach out directly to hiring managers and recruiters, but it falls on deaf ears usually. 

So my question is, what should I do to stand out more? so many said after you get your first job it gets easier...when? do I need to work a google or facebook to even get a phone interview; I don't know anymore. I understand the market is tough for Grads and bootcamp graduates; but I didn't realize it would be as tough for people that have some experience. 

If you want to see my resume, just message me as I don't feel comfortable sharing it here."
2717,cscareerquestions,hindsight on becoming a develop,"My goal here is to provide some realistic experience and feedback that can be useful in your decision making, and maybe spark some fun conversation.

So, let’s start with some background. I graduated college in 2018 with a bachelors in CompSci from a mediocre public university. I spent my first year at a private school thinking I was going to be a doctor, and transferred to the state school my sophomore year (rip all of those credits). Halfway through the year, after never touching programming before, I had been just destroying every article I could find. I was so addicted to learning about programming. It was fascinating.

I ended up making a friend in class and we got the idea to make a game together. Neither of us had any idea what we were doing. Eventually we decided on a VR project. About a month into the project, with minimal progress, I interviewed for an internship. It was a small project management company and they needed someone to do IT and help manage their sharepoint site. I was by no means qualified. BUT, the manager was really interested in the fact that I was working on a VR project, and that got me the job (this will be a recurring theme later). So I started working there for like $13/hour, and stayed there for a little over a year. The work was mediocre, I just googled their tech problems, and did a minor about of JavaScript work. The people were fun, and the company was a family.

Fast forward a year, I have learned the basics: object oriented programming, worked on some iOS projects, dove really deep into Unity... I get a new internship at a Health Insurance company. I was so beyond bored out of my mind that I quit after 3 weeks. It wasn't worth the pay bump. The month after, a friend I made in college told me his company is hiring a Unity developer (me at this time: a game dev job in the midwest, wtf?). It turns out to be a big government contractor, and I would be on the Research and Development team.

So they hire me and I near double my pay, and I get to work on cool projects utilizing Augmented Reality. When I graduate college, they hire me on. I get two patents for the work I completed, and secure the company millions in contracts for the software I made by myself (it wasn't really anything crazy, but Augmented Reality is shiny). However, I'm still not happy at this point. The people that work there are half and half. Half of them are just there to work and collect their retirement pensions, they don't do anything cool outside of work, and are the stereotype of devs you would normally see. The other half are alright, but still, working for that massive company just rubbed me the wrong way. There were a ton of security rules, and I just felt like I was constantly being monitored (I was being monitored I found out right as I quit). 

So, in January I start looking at jobs in my area, and I find a recruiter that does all of the searching for me. The bad part about the job search is that almost all of my professional experience is in Unity, and I'll never find another job that lets me use it in my area. My fiance is a teacher and can't leave her school, so moving isn't an option. So, I start REALLY thinking about what I want in a job. It comes down to a couple of things: good pay, a great culture, and decent benefits.

I interview at 5 companies and all of them want to hire me, I will explain why in a sec. I want to highlight how I made my choice. The first company did financial services, and their people were nice enough, but there was still this feeling of bureaucracy. I couldn't live with that. The other couple of companies just seemed so boring. Then I walk in the front door at my current employer, another financial services company. While I don't really have any interests in the financial sector, I figured I would give them a try since they seemed like they had a cool culture. I walk in the front door and the secretary greets me in just the happiest tone I've heard from a secretary. Perfect, I think, they treat her well, off to a good start. Then, I get seated in a big conference room, there's exposed wires, it's not super clean, etc. It was like just perfectly unorganized to the point where it wasn't ugly, but I could tell they weren't anal about things. The Lead Dev/Hiring manager and a senior dev walk in, and are just bubbly happy, perfect. We start chit chatting. They are hiring for a senior .NET developer. Well, I don't know anything about .NET web dev, BUT I have been using C# for years in Unity. 

The recruiter I used made it abundantly clear before I even went to interview that I am not a senior developer. When I asked them why they still interviewed me they said ""you might not have the knowledge or experience, but I don't care, it's all about finding the right candidate"". And that struck a chord with me. They aren't about coding tests, or BS interviews. It ended up just being us 3 geeking out over a bunch of stuff in the tech scene. It was that simple, I was a culture fit, that had a love for learning. I've been working here for 6 months, I make decent money, and I absolutely love everyone I work with. Even if there's a ton of ugly legacy code, and the actual product we make is boring... The team goes out and gets drunk together for lunch on Fridays. They go on walks together during the day. Most people have a cool hobby that's fun to talk about. There's a good amount of diversity, and everyone is respected. This matters so much more to me than anything else. I got an offer for 40k more at a different company and it just wasn't worth not being happy everyday.


Okay, so let's talk about what let me get to this point. I think there are several reasons I got a ""senior"" role and pay, being 2 years out of college and not even ever using the framework the company uses.
1. I make it abundantly clear I love the field. I talk with passion about my personal projects. Every. Single. Time. I talk about the game I'm working on. But that has nothing to do with what they do, right? Wrong. If you show you're a passionate person, that is beyond valuable to your work ethic, and your relationship with your coworkers.
2. I go in there with the best possible mood. I make it a point in the interview to talk about how my positive personality rubs off on my coworkers. I make it a point to compliment people, to carefully word Slack messages so there can't be ANY negative interpretation. I don't respond with ""ok."", i respond with ""awesome, thanks a bunch!""... And it makes A HUGE difference in what people think of interactions with you. 
3. I have touched a lot of different types of software. This is probably the most important part. While I haven't done .NET in particular... I have worked on website backends in C#, Java, Python, and Swift... I have done a decent bit of front end in Unity, iOS, and React/Angular. I don't know any of them terribly well, but by learning enough to make something in each of them, I got to learn their benefits and drawbacks, what makes them worth it over another choice. Those are the choices a senior dev has to make. WHY use this framework over that one.
4. This is probably tied for the most important piece of what makes companies want me: I work on open source projects. I run a non-profit organization called oneleif. We work on open source projects, mentor each other, and just have a community of devs/designers that are fun to be around (feel free to google us and join :D ). Not only does it look good to be a cofounder of a nonprofit... But by talking to so many different people I get to practice social skills, and learn things others are interested. Best of all I get to practice my leadership skills by running an open source project. I cannot recommend open source enough.

Okay, that was a long post, I hope it can be of use. If you have any questions, either message me here or join the oneleif discord, I would love to help anyone with anything!"
2718,cscareerquestions,2 years since graduating but trying to get a job,"It's officially been 2 years since I graduated with my bachelors in CS. I managed to get an internship after graduating but by the time I was done with the internship, I had lost all passion for programming due to various reasons that I won't get into here. I simply wasn't excited at all for roles I applied to and I think it was clear to interviewers.

I worked a couple of retail jobs and was basically ""lost"" in life for a little while, before recently regaining my passion to code around May 2020.

I taught myself PHP, then taught myself Node.JS, Express.js, and MongoDB; I made a couple of portfolio projects using these technologies. I think I am ready for an entry level back end developer role or something similar. 

I've begun applying again and I'm hoping to get some interviews soon. However I'm worried about two things.

First, how should I approach this gap in my resume?

If I was 100% truthful, would my true story put off the interviewer and lose me ""points""? 

Second, do I have a chance to get a job in the first place, or will I be put in the rejection pile once the gap comes up?

Any advice is welcome as well, thanks in advance"
2719,cscareerquestions,Is anti-referring a practice?,"I know of people who currently work at solid, reputed companies as SWE interns, but who have made their way there by a combination of cheating, leeching, and sucking up. Having worked personally with them, I am very much aware of how much they can contribute and their ability to talk their way out of situations. Consequently, I believe that hiring them would be detrimental to the company.

Because of this, I am wondering whether it is common practice for companies to have an ""anti-referral"" process, wherein one states to recruiters that they know a person who would _not_ be a good fit for the job, and that hiring them would likely not be the best use of company resources.

However pure development is mostly a desk job, and I've always been someone who likes to seek out new experiences, so I'm not sure I could ever work a full desk-job in the office. I don't mind sitting in front a computer and working out a highly abstract, complex issue, I enjoy that too, it's just that I also have a craving for physical and sensory experience and novelty that I need to satiate. It's hard to describe but I like being in new places, observing things in action and seeing the impact of something or the whole process of transformation. I was wondering about a way to not have to delegate this desire to my leisure time and somehow combine it with my work.

What interests me about IoT is edge computing, and also the fact that it envisions a world where everything becomes the domain of IT. This captured my mind because theoretically there could be a role in the field that was the combination of technical complexity and 'field work' (in varied domains) that I was looking for. I just don't know if and what concretely that role would entail. I was hoping some of the more experienced people on this sub could provide me with more insight.

2727,cscareerquestions,Unable to work because of daily emergencies,"Hi fellow dev, engineers and programmers!

I joined a start up 3-4 months ago on a project that has a lot of technical debt. My other collegue gave his resignation 1 month ago and I'm the only embedded dev left.

I'm not handling myself too badly as I try to integrate CI, tests, stability, better tooling and better communication with our business partners in this project, but I know this is all very time consuming. The project has a lot technical debt bundled with tedious or questionnable design choices.

One thing that is really bothering me is that every day there a is big emergency on prod systems or on customers systems and I'm the designated person to troubleshoot and fix these issues because almost no one else has the knowledge to do it (and I'm not even close to be an expert). This is combined with the fact that I do unexpexted QA for our business partners because they are not testing their software properly, which our product depends on. Add the huge amount of agile meetings and I'm barely able to do the job I was hired for: improving the current system which barely works in customer's hands.

To be honest, some customers have threatened to stop using our product because of how unreliable of is.

I love the fact that I'm making the project better but all the things above make my work advance at a turtle's pace. This is not very motivating.

I think my boss knows this and he wants to hire someone in september. I recommended someone I worked with previously who is pretty good at his trade but I'm not quite sure they will actually hire him.

My current job is my first software engineering position and I have been working here for about 1.5 years.

I brought it up during the interview and they assured me that as long as I am putting in good work, I would stick around.

Also there is a solid chance by current employer is willing to match the salary offered to me. I suppose one of the biggest reasons for leaving, for me, is that it might make me a better developer."

I don’t plan on leaving anytime soon in fact I’m scared to leave or look for any other job. The problem is I have no formal education in CS. I have a bs in Mechanical and Electrical engineering.

Would it be faster and more effective to read books and/or look for a decent Udemy course on the subject? Or is CS50 a much better use of my time? I'm probably skipping out on the whole Bootcamp because not only has everything gone remote while the prices stay the same, on top if it, it sounds like most Bootcamps just teach Udemy courses pretty much, buy finding I suppose the best one's and kinda adding to them and changing a bit. So it sounds like you're paying the big bucks for mentorship, and possibly the name of the Bootcamp backing you. I realize bootcamps in Canada aren't a dime a dozen like the States, but I still wonder how seriously they're taken by companies around here.  


Anyways i can't of ranted a bit there, no need to read it all. Basically I'm trying to go the self study route, at least for now and want to gain more knowledge in some CS stuff, that isn't necessarily programming but can aid in that. Thanks in advance."
2738,cscareerquestions,Advice on how to transfer to another department?,"Hey I'm pretty socially awkward so I'm hoping to get some help on how to go about this. At my company I work as an engineer on product A. About a year ago product B started being developed as a kind of ""2.0"" of product A for clients who need something a little more modern but product A would continue to be developed and supported probably for as long as possible. I'm a tech lead on product A and assist the team working on product B quite frequently to help them keep their development on track and make sure their product is actually addressing the needs of our clients that I've run into so frequently while working with product A. Last week I was on a call with one of the lead devs on product B and he was kind of venting/ranting about work stuff and expressed how much he'd love it if I was on his team instead of my current one because of just how much I know in this space and how helpful I've been to him.

I don't know how serious he was about this but after thinking about it I actually want to pursue this. I've gotten pretty tired of my current position for various reasons and I like the idea of working in a new tech stack on something new that's being built from the ground up. How can I approach this guy and ask if I can seriously transfer? I'm really shy and don't know how to start these kinds of conversations. I know a lot of people will say ""just ask"" but it's hard for me to rationalize that it's so simple..."
2739,cscareerquestions,"Ok, seriously. How the fuck do I get through coding challenges?","Just got my rejection from a big N company. It sucks, miserably. I thought I did great on the other interviews in the final round, but I completely bombed the coding interview so I get why I was rejected.

I just... don’t know how to overcome coding challenges. I really don’t. If you’re reading this, and were in my shoes at one point, desperate because you don’t know what else to do or try, what helped? 

How did you finally “make it”?

2740,cscareerquestions,Does anybody see a therapist in this field? Wondering if it will be valuable. Mental health taking a toll in this field,"Recently started working as a new grad a couple of months ago and realized that I am really going through some shit mentally, in part because of the job.

A lot of it has to do with how easy I suddenly have it. A high paying six figure job in my early 20s where I sit at a desk in my apartment for 4-8 hours a day. I make literally 10x more than my dad does, who is near the poverty line. My friends who are all graduating are struggling to find jobs. My girlfriend in college makes minimum wage, and won't make much more than that when she graduates. I also feel like its tough to have any meaningful romantic relationship with somebody when they know how much money you're making as soon as you tell them about your career.

One of the weirdest memories I have is leaving my apartment in San Francisco the first night I got there for my previous internship. There were homeless people in tents lining the street, while I realized I was making the most money I ever had in my life. 

I guess all this leads to feelings of emptiness. Is this all there is to life now? I keep working my six figure job, keep making more, have a comfortable cushion and nest egg for the rest of my life, and thats it?

I also realized I don't really have a concept of home because I've been travelling so much as a result of the job. Inevitably I will have to leave my friends, girlfriend, and friend behind as I keep focusing on my career and moving. 

I have hobbies that I focus on but these thoughts have been increasingly creeping in my mind. Does anybody else have similar experiences, and would a therapist help with this?"

2744,cscareerquestions,"What would be considered a more financially stable job, cybersecurity or software dev?","I'm struggling to pick either one, as both seem what I want to pursue in the long run. The following is what i intend to do or am looking towards as an option after college,

1. Get an M.S. in Cybersecurity or M.S. in Computer Science

2.Work in a Banking/Finance field (I know I might be told to

3.Be able to find a high paying and stable job in Cybersecurity and be able to live comfortably in a middle class.

4.Be able to possibly become an indie game developer (as a hobby)

This is the courses I would need for the B.S. in Cybersecurity:

This is for the B.A. in Computer Science:
https://www.cis.fiu.edu/academics/degrees/undergraduate/b-a-computer-science/

I'm aware that some might suggest a B.S. in Computer Science, and honestly it seems incredibly practical to have, but my main problem is how fast I might graduate from college. I desire nothing more than to learn as much as I can, but in realizing I must take calculus and physics classes, it will take me about year longer to graduate. My goal is to find a job that can make me more financially stable, but I realize the longer I take in graduating, the longer it will take for me to make myself financially independent. I also intend on taking calculus and physics classes after I graduate as I still want to build a good foundation in math and science. Of course I'm only new to this, so those with more experience might sway me to a different mindset. Any advice is appreciated."
2745,cscareerquestions,Choosing a college major (CE or CS),"I'm a senior in hs applying to colleges currently and I like aspects from both CE and CS but not all of one. I really like bioinformatics, machine learning, AI, I've done some cybersecurity which is kind of interesting and I think I'm okay at coding in general. I also like circuitry and hands-on engineering. I have experience in all these things and biomedical robotics also interests me a LOT (I would need ECE or CE program probably for this since I don't want to apply to a major like BME or EE because they have very limited career opportunities) however that's the only thing I don't have experience in.

In CS I'm not really interested in how programming languages work and the computational math behind it but in CE I'm not interested in building computers either. I'm scared that if I do CS I'll just be stuck coding which I can do but I don't think I would enjoy only that. In CE I'm scared I will get stuck in too much of the building hardware side and not get to explore my Machine Learning and AI interests.

I have some schools I want to apply to rn like UMD, Georgia Tech, Cornell, some other ivies but I'm still looking for schools which is hard because I'm not fully sure about the major. If someone could help me decide if CS or CE seems like a better fit (maybe even recommend some schools :D) that would be so helpful."
2746,cscareerquestions,"Love CS, but I don't know if I should pursue it. Please tell me my options. (Incoming CS major)","**Backstory:** Hello. I am 18 years old and starting my first semester of college in a month pursuing a computer science degree. I don't know how to put this, but I want to catch my mistakes before they happen. I'm not sure if pursuing a CS degree is the best choice for me. I have loved computers and technology since I was 10, built my first computer when I was 12, and went to a vocational high school where I was strictly taught computer science every other week. I got my first job when I was 14 working at a local diner where I was a bus boy and eventually became a cook, and when I was 17 I was offered a position as a software intern at a fortune 500 company that contracts to the government. During my internship I didn’t learn much because I was brought into an engineering team that didn't have programmers, so I was tasked with creating software that would be used within that team, which I accomplished all in Python. I was never taught Python, so I still don’t know how I pulled it off initially. Also, it really wasn't much, but the company looks good on a resume. Eventually the internship ended, mostly due to COVID because being a minor at the time and only being an intern put complications/restraints on everything. When the internship ended I got a job at a chain burger place, which I basically immediately left(once I found another job) due to corporate bs. I decided I was done with the restaurant industry at this point and I found a job at a local farm where I currently work now doing various tasks that I really don't mind. 

**Problem:** However, due to my experience I can conclude that A) It seems that any corporate business sucks. B) Programming things I have no interest in programming will make me want to jump off of a cliff faster than anything. C) If I get a degree in CS and don't like the field, then that will really suck.

I have tried looking for smaller companies(when my internship was ending), but I also don't want to be the victim of ""a new startup company near you is hiring fresh CS majors"" and then end up in the same mess when I was the only one on a team and no one else knew a thing about the limitations, scope, and process it takes to make software.  So my final question is, what do I do? Is there any job I could find in CS that I would enjoy and wouldn't treat me like a number? The blue collar jobs I've worked were much more fulfilling considering I was treated like a person and there was a balanced understanding of limitations and expectations. However, I feel like I also have the potential to be successful in a white collar job, but if I pursue it and don't end up liking it then I'd probably just end up working labor jobs again, and this time with 4 years wasted and a chonky debt.

My other interest I have currently is video games but I'm unaware of the environment that takes place in development, and I don't think AAA companies are quite fond of bringing along the inexperienced like me to shadow or intern, and indie companies don't have the resources to teach or shadow someone inexperienced like me. To get my foot in the door I have looked at part-time QA jobs, but all require over a year of experience in testing, and I wouldn't consider my python internship much to say I'm experienced.

I know if I pursue the degree I can freelance, but I'm more so looking for something I can make a career of and be interested in. I don't have the knowledge, skill, or experience to become an indie dev, and it's hard to get on a small team when you're still learning.

It's also hard to find internships when you're labeled as a first-year college student, because I feel like I have enough potential to work a part-time internship right now, but I can't even find a place for that either.

I would just like to know what my options are, and if I should pursue a different degree considering my current frustrations with the CS environment.

**TL;DR** I have a wealth of CS knowledge for my age, experienced some corporate environment from an internship, currently thinking of my future job for during/after college and not sure if it it'll be the right thing for me. Was wondering if there were other career options for CS majors, and if there are any smaller companies I could work for, and potentially get my foot in the door now considering my educational experience."
2747,cscareerquestions,Demoralized in a Coding Bootcamp and wondering if this is the right route to take.,"I'm currently halfway through a full-stack coding bootcamp and I think I've made a mistake. My parents pushed me in this direction with the idea that if I attended one of these bootcamps I'd walk out, find a job, and make a lot of money. I've tried to tell them that's not how it works but I went with it anyway and am regretting it. The instructors and TA's are all wonderful and are passionate about what they do, but man is this course putting me through my paces. I graduated with a History Degree last year so this is all extremely confusing for me. I struggle to keep up in class and have to go to office hours constantly with what I think are basic questions. As the difficulty has been mounting I've started having panic attacks. The idea of doing this as a profession terrifies me. However, there's that allure of eventually getting a well-paid job but I don't think its worth it if I stress myself into an early grave.

To those who've attended coding bootcamps and found jobs, was it worth it and how stressed are you at your careers?

Also I do have some backup options as I recently completed an internship with a non-coding company and have a contact who is scouting out possible positions at other employers."
2748,cscareerquestions,"Network engineer, what's next?","Hi

I will in one year finish my apprenticeship as an IT infrastructure specialist (yes, that is the basically the title, that I will get once finished). I am fairly certain that my current place of employment will not offer me a position afterwards. 

As so, I have been thinking a lot about what is next. I lean towards the network side of things. So I am wondering, what is ideally the path to go from here?

I have through my apprenticeship gone through several departments: Servicedesk, on-site support, client management, network and server. My last department will be cloud management. I am in a situation where I ended up as a jack of all trades, master of none.

I like the idea of being a network engineer, but have doubts about the future of it.

Is cloud a safer route to go with, or should I stay with networking? If staying with networking is a good idea, what should I go for?

I have basic knowledge of windows servers, light knowledge of Linux servers. I have a CCNA certification and a passing grade on CCNP route and switching (my schools curriculum on network is based on Cisco material, but doesn't offer certifications).

TL;DR: Jr. dev without CS background doing well on the job but wants to learn CS for personal development. 

I’m a Junior developer who doesn’t hold a CS degree. I’ve always loved computers and worked on personal small programming projects from a young age, but I wasn’t particularly great at math in high school (b student), which scared me away from enrolling in CS program. I ended up getting a degree in a different field, but didn’t really enjoy the work after graduating. I found myself hangin out with developers from work and grew more and more curious. After studying  web dev on my own for a year, I decided to enroll on a bootcamp because I thought I’d get more CS knowledge (big mistake). I researched the possibility of going back to college, but most of my credits wouldn’t transfer to a CS program and I wouldn’t want to go back to school for 3 years.

After being in the bootcamp for a year (it’s a 2 year program), I found myself unemployed and figured I could try applying for some dev jobs and landed a position as a jr frontend dev. I love the job and was quickly promoted to jr full stack dev after I started fixing backend bugs. I’m doing pretty well on the job and don’t really find myself struggling often, but I do know that I have a lot of gaps in CS. I spend most of my free time reading articles and books about programming, but sometimes it’s a bit overwhelming and difficult to know what I’m supposed to be studying when I don’t encounter issues on the say to day.

I want to learn CS for personal and professional development as I’m genuinely fascinated by it. Any recommendations on books/resources that could help me?

26 year old B.comm Finance grad, analyst/almost associate portfolio manager at a asset/wealth management firm in Toronto, Canada. Covid hit, we're at home, I realized how uninspired my job is at it's core once you strip away all of the socials/perks/gross pursuit of money/etc and I've been learning web development on my own since April. Worked through learning the basics of HTML/CSS and jumped into deep learning JS which has led me to experimenting with the MERN stack. While I continue to work on the projects I have on the go I've been dabbling in leetcode and begun to read an Intro to Algorithms by T H Cormen now that the CFA3 has been pushed to next May and my schedule is fully clear. 

Without going into too much more depth, I'm looking for some guidance on shifting my focus to applying for jobs in NYC or California, but more specifically what type of jobs I can realistically hope to get as entry level/jr dev. 

In terms of the larger, more reputable tech companies, how open are they to interviewing people for jr roles without prior experience, and more importantly, without a CS/traditional STEM degree?

I was thinking about learning about web development through freecodecamp and other sources to potentially get a job as a web developer someday. However, the more I’ve researched, it seems like it’s incredibly difficult to get a job as a web developer without a cs degree. And freelancing doesn’t seem like a reliable source of income for a lot of people. Should I honestly even bother? 

I’m currently in college on my final year as a Biology major. I honestly don’t want to or even have the money to start college over and major in cs.

2770,cscareerquestions,Is it insane or reasonable to be considering a help-desk/support technician role as a soon-to-be CS grad with no industry experience?,"I'm on track to graduate in summer/fall 2021 with my BSCS. My degree will be from a no-name school, and it is looking unlikely that I will be able to acquire an internship in the foreseeable future. I'm also a 30 year old career switcher so the plan has always been to pursue entry level work in CS upon graduating. Given the list of global variables I cannot control, I'm doing my best to work on side-projects, leetcode, and build a portfolio.

Based on future projections of in-demand languages, or gambling (if you prefer), I've been spending copious amounts of time studying Python in depth and would obviously prefer to land a role as a junior software engineer/developer and work with Python, Java, etc...That being said, times are tough, and as for the job market - competition is brutal, demand is staggering, and supply is seemingly abysmal.

If I couldn't land a junior dev role, I would be very interested in finding something along the lines of SDET or QA, as I would be quite content starting out in a role of that sort with the 1-2 year goal of transitioning into a dev from there.

This is starting to feel a bit like a long sloppy elif loop of metaphorical code that might end with:

""else:

\#tab# IT help-desk/ support technician""

What other roles might CS grads be considering before selling themselves as short as a help desk position?

Would it be the end of the world to take a role of that sort given the economic outlook as a fresh grad? 50k (at best) for a year to be arguably over-qualified. I would of course be eagerly applying to every dev position that pops up in the course of that time.

This is a long post, so I do appreciate those who have taken the time to read it and perhaps share a bit of insight of their own in regards to these ideas. I'm still learning a lot but I'm quite new to the field, so I'm trying to be as realistic as possible in programming my future."

2773,cscareerquestions,Need advice! Consulting vs. Product Management?,"Hey guys, I could really use some advice right now. I am currently a rising junior studying computer science with a finance minor. I am really interested in eventually working in the tech industry, but honestly I'm not great at coding. I do well in classes, but I feel like I just know enough to do well in these classes, and cannot be considered ""competitively good"" compared to my peers if that makes sense. This last week, I was offered an internship at Ernst &amp; Young (EY) for summer 2021. The position is for the TAP Program (Technology Advisory Program). Basically, it is more or less of a consulting internship with a concentration on leveraging technology for the clients. I was really excited about this position, and super proud of myself for getting it. Once the excitement died down though, I became to have second thoughts. I'm not sure if this makes sense or makes me sound ungrateful, but I feel like I could do more with myself beyond consulting. I was never specifically interested in consulting, but I just sort of applied to the position without fully realizing how much it was related. There are lots of people who get into consulting with a comp sci degree, and I feel like since I'm working so hard to get that cs degree I should use it in a more applicable field (on top of the fact that I don't have that huge interest in consulting in the first place). I hope I don't sound ungrateful - I definitely am so thankful for the EY opportunity and recognize that I'm very lucky but I Just don't want to have any regrets. 

Basically, what I'm thinking about is the idea that if I were to do the internship my junior year summer, I would be ""stuck"" doing consulting full time the following year(s) since EY is known to give full time return offers for most interns if you do fine (not sure if COVID will affect this though). The problem is that I want to go into a role more like product management. The timing is tricky because I don't think I would have the time to do another internship but I do want to try to get into product if that is a possibility. My summer 2021 EY offer is ""at-will"" so either parties (me or EY) can terminate at any time. Should I look into another internship for summer 2021 that better aligns with my interests or should I Just take the EY offer? If I were to apply to other internships that summer, is there any way I can leverage the EY offer or is that frowned upon? Really not sure how any of this works so hopefully you guys can help me out with any advice."

2775,cscareerquestions,"As a developer, should you work for a company that does not practice any software methodology?","I noticed in many companies that involve a project, whether small or big , where the project manager does not practice software development life cycle, or at least not fully. I, too work for 3 different companies ranging from startup, SME and MNC and there isn't proper practices in the development of the project that you would expect such no proper documentation, user requirements or user stories changed very frequently, no practice of scrum or kanban, no daily meetings. It's more of just allocate the task accordingly to each team members and get it done within X time.

Probably the closest life cycle I see is testing which of course is a no brainer and needs to be done. So, is this a common thing in IT industry in general and when looking for company for SWE, should I look for a company that really practices the methodology properly?"
2776,cscareerquestions,Need some advice on what I should do,Hi all I would love some advice on the situation that I am in. I apologize in advance if this isn't the proper sub to post in. Recently I graduated from a bootcamp and realized that I need a computer science degree to really exceed in the field as well as just wanting it for personal fulfillment. I have been looking at different options to do that while looking for a entry level job and recently came across WGU. I have some college credits already and found that I can complete my generals on [study.com](https://study.com) and transfer them to WGU if I choose to do so. This route is really affordable for me and really the only thing stopping me is the name of the university. I also checked with a couple of schools that I am interested in if I wanted to do my masters afterwards and they all have said that they accept the degree from WGU which I found to be a plus as well. So I guess my question is how is it viewed in the field and in general. Would I be discriminated because of my degree and viewed differently than other applicants with their bachelors? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!
2777,cscareerquestions,What do you say during standup if you didn't get anything done the previous day?,"Sometimes, for whatever reason, I don't accomplish anything in a day. In those situations, during the following day's standup, I don't know what to say. The team might as what was blocking me. If there was a technical problem, then I feel comfortable saying that. Thats fine. I probably actually raised that on slack.

However if I merely spent the whole previous day wallowing in self-pity and suicidal ideation, thats trickier. I don't want to make it my team's problem, but I also just.... have no idea what to say. Usually, after an unproductive day, this motivates me to stay up late and try to make up for the lost time. However, sometimes I have therapy after work and that eats into the time I can spend trying to write code. Also, the sleep deprivation, lack of exercise, and loneliness (my marriage would be totally collapsed except she needs to stay with me for my work visa) has increased my frequency of unproductive days. I have concluded that I need to have something to say even if I did *not* make up for lost time.


What do you generally say in that sort of situation?"

2781,cscareerquestions,GM NEEDS ADVICE BADLY,"
So here’s my dilemma, I am the General Manager at a small company with about 16 employees. I don’t wish to include any names or company information I just need advice. I have been the GM  for 3 going on 4 years. The owners are mostly absent handed and I manage pretty much everything, except the wife comes along quite often, is frequently finding things that are “wrong” and constantly wanting things done. Most of these things are reasonable but sometimes not addresses in the best manor and makes a lot of employees feel under appreciated or undervalued. I constantly stress their value to me but they and myself included are very stressed about this. 
Last year the owners wife wanted someone else there to join as my assistant manager that she trusted in order to help run things.  The owner stated this was so I would have less on my plate and he could help get the wife away from the property more. This has not been the case. Since this gentleman has joined he has frequently had a bad attitude, employees do not like him with the exception of one or two that he is close with. It feels like he adds more to my plate than is necessary and does little to relieve me of any of my actual duties. He frequently tells staff to do things we have not discussed and fails to fill me in. I have tried to talk to him many times about these issues but he is very dismissive and has an excuse for everything. I have tried to talk with the owner about these issues but of course every time he goes to him, he has an excuse and dismisses it. I feel like I’m holding everything together by the skin of my teeth, I have become very stressed out and I don’t know what else to do. I don’t understand the owners dedication to this gentleman and it doesn’t make sense why I can’t get through to them. I love this company, I have been there 5 going on 6 years and I don’t want to leave. For the most part the owners have been very good to me over this time and I don’t want to offend them but I don’t know what else to do. I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and hard place. Anyone have and advice on what I could do. It’s getting to the point where I feel so stressed I am shaking at times. I also fear that I will start loosing more staff. Last year I had a great staff that was with me for almost two years total. Now I have only 5 that remain the same and am struggling to keep anyone of any quality. I feel like a lot of this has to do with the poor moral as a result of this individual’s attitude. Please anyone even if it’s just words of encouragement please give me your advice.i know I need to talk to the owner but I feel like he may just be getting upset if I come to him too much about the same thing."

Now that I've got some professional work under my belt I've been toying with the idea of building some kind of SaaS app in my free time and totally aside from my normal work.

I have a relatively good idea of how to do most of the things I need to do, including building the front end, REST API etc etc. However there are some more intricate aspects of building a webapp that I'm not so familiar with and that I can already foresee them causing some issues for me. Some examples would be properly designing user permissions, security around HTTP requests to ensure one user doesn't see another user's data, GDPR, a login system etc.

These are definitely more advanced parts of SWE, and it would help me massively to have some resources on how to do these kinds of things. So I was hoping that someone would be able to point me in the right direction in terms of some resources, internet or otherwise that go into more depth for these particular aspects.

Obviously Google is my first port of call, but sometimes it seems that these more advanced issues are seldom written about and there may be a single Medium article and nothing else that's useful. 

Also apologies if this isn't the right sub, I'm not aware of any other subs that are oriented around software engineering but in a more general sense. Most of the other subs seem to be for beginners or are specifically tailored to a language i.e. /r/java or /r/javahelp

This kind of talk is prevalent in all industries, but I want to use my own field (which is the biggest culprit of pushing this stuff) and provide three reasons why we need to stop complaining about this sort of thing.

1. It doesn't exist. There isn't a ""puzzling lack of leadership representation"" in the management space. Look at big tech companies, where Indian/Indian Americans far dominate CEO and other key management positions, from Microsoft, Google, etc. What happened there? Did bamboo ceiling stop when it comes to certain Asians but not others, like East Asians? And this isn't even sector-specific. Look at Venture Capital firms. Top ones like Andreesen Horowitz is filled with East Asians as limited partners making basically 300k a year in salaries alone. Where is the bamboo ceiling?
2. Some people don't want to go into management (shocker). So stop forcing people into doing it. Lots of my Asian male engineering friends from top companies don't want to go into management. They already make great money doing the stuff they love, which is a love for building things with code. They don't want to sacrifice that so that they can stress out over company politics and managing people, which doesn't come naturally to them. So stop forcing people to go into things they don't want.
3. If there is some kind of ceiling against you, then address it HR or leave for a better company. Eric Yuan of Zoom couldn't get his pitched idea to the company roadmap. So he left and built a multi-billion dollar company. And he still speaks with broken English in public interviews.

Instead of complaining about some mystical force that oppresses Asians, why don't you instead look at many Asian leaders and non-leaders who succeeded, and follow their footsteps? It's payoff much better in the long run, I promise."
2802,cscareerquestions,Are there jobs out there that require a mix of user engagement and software development?,"I've been a software developer for the past 3 years. I enjoy making software and am doing decent in terms of career progression.

I worked on a team where our users would cut us tickets and we would respond by either providing them better instructions, or fixing the bug, or whatever. I loved doing that. I also worked with a research team during college and enjoyed seeing them enjoy my work.

I guess roles that come to mind are consultant or UI/UX work. I don't know if I have enough experience for consultancy (just 3.5 years total as a software dev) and I don't really want to retrain or go back to school for UI/UX work. I'd be open to it though."

2805,cscareerquestions,Need career advice about taking a new role,"Hello,

My current job is at a small tech shop, which I have held since graduating. I came out of college with a lot of bad habits (slowness at getting work done, carelessness), which lead to some mistakes. I was scared i was going to be fired, so I applied to a few places while at my current job. My boss also started giving me simple tasks that could be done with someone without a CS background

However, that period of tension has subsided, and now I'm starting to get tasks that involve more programming. My boss also likes me more. These tasks that I'm getting now are more challenging, but also more interesting. I am still slower than other developers, but I get things done. Being at a  small tech shop, the pace is slow, which might set me up for problems when I move on to a programming role at a bigger place.

However, I also have an offer from a defence contractor, for a non-programming role. This is a managerial role, from what it sounds like, that interfaces between developers and clients. I will write documentation for the developers, report to clients, read documentation, and test their products. I am not a ""natural programmer""- I don't build apps in my free time, and the last leetcode problem I did was a few months ago.

On one hand, this new role might be something that I am better at, and it pays far more. Furthermore, people who I know say the managerial role is better because you are no longer a cog who switches between tickets in projects, but someone who sees the entire picture. I also understand that finding non-developer roles is difficult, so this might be a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity, and if i want to improve my skills, I can program in my free time.

On the other hand, the whole reasons for seeking a new job are diminished, and even though I am a slow programmer at a small firm, I am being exposed to harder and harder tasks by people who are patient. Furthermore, I have never done the kind of role i am being offered before. I also have good relationships with my colleagues, and it's going to be difficult to find people that tolerating if I go back to programming. On a more personal note, I have a lot of terrible habits that now i am improving on due to having a stable job. The whole process of building good habits will thrown off by starting a new stressful role, where I will have to stay late. I understand that comes across as laziness and whining, and that probably says more about how I need to deal with strssful challenges better.

I want to turn the contractor down soon so as not burn bridges (I accepted the offer roughly a month ago but I am going through a process of giving them documentation), but that might be too late

TL;DR: I have a job offer that I need to decide on soon; it pays a lot more. It's a managerial role; not a programming role. Need advice as to whether leave my current job that I enjoy"

I'm trying to decide between a bachelor's in IT or CS at WGU which would take around a year to complete and around 10k. A masters in IT at WGU. My dad suggested doing a bachelors because it would teach me the basics, and that a masters would overqualify me.

However, some of my friends said it would be pointless to do 2 bachelors, but a lot of people on reddit have said a masters isn't needed in IT, and it costs more, and can overqualify you if don't have a lot of experience.

I possibly picked the worst time to get back in the software engineering ring after a long break, so I'm not sure how it'll go. I have 3.5 years of experience before I took off, where I worked at a big tech company, and then two smaller startups, all in NYC. typical full-stack (javascript, python) dev working on web applications.

My goal is:

1. Have another 15-20 years, if it's even possible. Leave tech around age 45. I've already accepted I'm not smart enough to launch a startup or a self-sustaining business, so that leaves in more work.

2. Transition more towards PM at a big tech company. Is this possible in the late 30s to late 40s age range? And how can I go from SWE to there?


Ultimately, I'm terrified of ageism that will come with my thirties and forties. Me being relatively average at programming, I 100% know I can't last, especially in my thirties. 


I know people think ageism isn't *that* bad, I am *sure* there are great engineers in their fifties at Microsoft or something, but I am on the lower end of competency. I don't have amazing talent to beat out my decline as I get older.

[reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/hlvoor/are\_side\_projects\_worth\_it/](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsEU/comments/hlvoor/are_side_projects_worth_it/)

Hello wonderful people of [r/cscareerquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/),

When it comes to job search, and applying to the FAANGs/FAANG like companies (Two Sigma, Jane Street, Palantir, Citadel, Google, Facebook, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Amazon etc) are side projects worth it for the CV boost to get the interview?

I graduated from Cambridge in 2019 (Physics), and have around 1 years worth of experience in full stack (current company) + three month Python internship in the past (plus my third year project also was in Python). I am currently at this stage, where I fancy a change (location), and potentially moving to Zurich/London/Dublin, and I am planning on applying to the FAANGs/Banks/Trading companies.

At the minute, I am in the wonderful phase of studying date structures/algorithms/system design and starting to grind LeetCode/Algoexpert (loved the crash course on data structures and algorithms) in the evenings and on weekends (absolutely loving it tbh - has been an absolutely treat during the lockdown), and general studying (finished working through Grokking Algorithms today) to supplement my lack of CS degree.

Over the past month, I have constructed a master interview roadmap prep for myself (happy to share, and document the journey if people will be interested - may also create a crash course on youtube to teach people/reinforce my learning all of the important stuff in DS&amp;A), and I am considering whether it would be worthwhile to create a nice portfolio website for myself for extra brownie points and include it on my CV when making the jump.

I have made a react/nodejs/postgre web app last month, as well as making a website (put it together using bootstrap, however fancy rewriting it in react - think it is not necessary, but may as well for the practice), and was just thinking whether it would be a good idea to create a couple more projects as well to display it alongside?

My only worry is that it may not be the best investment of time, as from what I know, the interviews at the big companies are meant to be focused on algorithms/data structures, and if the recruiters won't even take a look to weigh up making a decision on whether or not pass me to the first interview stage, then it seems that grinding more questions/studying more/doing more mock interviews could be more beneficial.

In terms of timeline, I am planning on doing a mass round of applications (asking friends to recommend me/sending CVs) at the end of October (not in a rush, plus want to spend the next four months enjoying myself and not putting myself under the pressure of facing the interviews) and hopefully get the process done and over with by the end of the year, so I would have to do the extra two projects in these next four months.

The questions I would like to know the answer of, especially if you went through these interviews/are a recruiter for any of the big companies (I assume the process for these is the same in EU and USA):

1. Do extra projects outside of work are likely to help you get an interview if you already have experience?
2. During the interview process, did you ever find yourself getting brownie points for talking about your projects?"

I recently (less than three months) started working for a small company in central Canada working in VR/Unity/C# development after leaving my previous employer of one year. 

They pay ~70k CAD a year, full benefits, great pension. 

I love it, great coworkers and the work is fun and engaging. However it is small (less than 15 people) and the seems to be very limited runway. 

I've been put in contact with a very large telecommunications company for ethical hacking through a friend. He speaks very highly of the work and the people and also makes a reasonable salary which he expects I'd also command (90k).

It requires moving across the country and is a contract position but as im young and have savings ive decided to risk it if offered.

How do i go about making it clear to my current company it is not personal despite it being so soon? Am I awful to want this change basically purely for the money, as I know I'd love that work as well and the extra 20k more than compensates for the increased cost of living. Not to mention having a huge company on the resume will pay dividends long term."

2826,cscareerquestions,Game Development - CS Degree VS Experience (self-taught),"Hello everyone!

Before I start talking about my concerns, I would like to tell you some things about me.

I major in computer science and for the last two and a half months I have been into game development. I started learning about game development in general. From what programs are used in order to make a game, to shipping your game on a platform. Then, I started learning blender and unreal engine (and still learning). I really do like what I am doing,  because I can combine everything I like (making music, programming, art, animation, 3D modeling, or even expressing my thoughts through a story). 

I just feel great :)



So, to the point.

My first undergraduate year has come to an end, and I've been think about dropping out.

The reason is, that I want to do things that I am passionate about. I don't find the joy when I am forced to study. I am trying to see things with a different perspective, but in the end, I just hate it more.
I don't find the classes difficult, they just take a lot of my time and I can't keep up with the things that I really care about.


Many people tell me that having a degree it's a must in order to get a job, and without it you are unable to show your skills.

I know that your learn the fundamentals in order to continue on your own, but I think is much more important to do what makes you feel ""alive"" now, than waiting four years to graduate and then start doing your thing.

I know, a degree is important, but not for all people.
Of course if you want to be a doctor, it's mandatory to have a degree, but this doesn't apply in everyone's future job.

By the way, most of these people don't even know how to use the internet properly. 
I mean, anyone can show-off/""advertise"" their skills on the internet and get a job. It just takes time to be noticed by an employer.

Anyways, I believe that gaining experience in game development (music, art, 3D modeling) is more valuable than spending my next 3-4 years studying things that I am forced to learn.

I'm also willing to start my own game company as solo developer when a have a proper game ready.


What do you think?


Thank you in advance!"
2827,cscareerquestions,Should I continue working for a small startup or seek an internship at a bigger company?,"Hey everyone

I’m in the process of looking into internships for the coming summer (Dec - Feb). I had an internship for a smaller company last summer and since then I have been working for them remotely while studying.

2 weeks prior to starting this internship, which was iOS development, the iOS developer for this company had left, leaving a lot of extra work for me to try take on. I learned a lot super quickly and started working on a new app for a new product of this company. Fast forward to now about 8 months since I started my internship and about 80% of the app has been developed by me and the rest by the replacement for the full time developer.

This has provided me with a lot of good experience and knowledge and I have felt super lucky with how things turned out. I am now wondering if I should do a second internship with this same company over next summer - which would look like me continuing the work I’m already doing now remotely. 

The alternative view I had from a friend who is also looking for an internship is that I should try to make it into one of the big tech companies and extend my network and connections. I do see some validity in this argument however I’m not 100% convinced that this is the only way to go about it - not to mention that now with coronavirus, most stuff overseas is probably out of the immediate picture which for me includes the US.

The scheduled release date for this new product that I have been making the app for would be part way into the next internship if I were to take it. The way I see this working out for me is that I would then have an app on the App Store made for a real business with real users that was started and majority developed by me. Not only that but after release would come further maintenance and new features. I believe all of this would give me a huge advantage in the more distant future when looking around for other jobs.

So now I am tossing up what route I should take:
- Stay with a smaller company for a second internship. Release the app I’ve been working on for so long to the market. Have experience with the full product lifecycle alongside a real business’s app to put on my CV
- Move to a larger company. Probably more competitive which speaks for itself. Perks of extending my network and connections. I would also experience different methods of development at a different company in order to widen my abilities.

I would greatly appreciate any advice!

Thanks so much"

2835,cscareerquestions,Code: Data Science vs. SWE,"Hi everyone,

First time posting here so bear with me.

I finished up graduate school in early 2019 with a degree in Epidemiology. My program was a hybrid between traditional stats and data science (specifically ML). This is where I learned python and various data science-related skills.

After grad school, I spent 6 months working as a data scientist in Silicon Valley and then switched to working in a think tank as a technical consultant (essentially a data scientist). My experience is mainly around building ML models on large data sets to answer specific policy questions.

My job required I get a US government clearance and a lot of the work I did was for various government agencies.

I reached out to a recruiter at a huge tech firm who told me she’d find a cleared data science role for me, but later insisted I apply as a software engineer because I have at least a year’s worth of programming experience.

I now have my final “on-site” interview (virtual due to COVID-19) soon and I’m totally freaking out because as a data scientist, I’ve never had to write code like a software engineer would; I write pragmatic code and never really had to think about time/space complexity or efficiency in the traditional sense. Also, because I’m coming into this from a non-CS background, I have no real understanding of common algorithms and struggle with medium difficulty leet-code type problems lol.

For clarity, the position requires at least one year of python and scripting experience (which I have), but it’s as a data scientist, not a software engineer. It also requires a government clearance (which I have).

Question: Do I have any shot of getting this position? Any data scientists out there currently occupying SWE roles? Should I withdraw my name from consideration and just wait for a data science role?

Edit: typo."

My story of getting into grad school is different from the traditional path to pursue research. I came from a non-CS background from India and the main reason to get into a grad school is to change my career path and I spent all my Masters years trying to graduate and get a job in the US. However, the field Deep Learning (NLP) amazed me and made me think about pursuing research. But unfortunately, I couldn't pursue my interest because of the immediate financial responsibilities I have to take care of which wouldn't be possible with the stipend I get from research. Also, my chances of getting into a good grad school are near to zero now considering my academic background and zero research experience.

However, now I got a job and I am sure that I can be free of those financial burdens in a couple of years which stopped me from enrolling in a Ph.D. program. My interest to go back to college to do research hasn't gone away. I am focused now to draw a road map to do a PhD in a couple of years. I have a few questions to be answered before even considering going in that direction.

1. First off, does the idea of working in the industry for a couple of years and going back to college for research really work?
2. I want to pursue my research at Stanford/CMU which are currently the best institutions for doing research in NLP. If 1 works, what should I do get admission in these colleges? How should I build a roadmap for a year or two from now?
3. I am working in a software developer job that has nothing to do with Deep Learning. How do I build my research experience while doing this job?
4. Due to this abandoned thought of pursuing research during my Masters, I haven't really developed any good relationship with my professors which would help me in the future. How to get recos in this case?

2839,cscareerquestions,Continuing internship after summer?,"I'm doing a tech internship at one of the big companies (tesla level - physics stuff) but I'm not sure if I should continue once summer ends.

Problem is I will be making $800 a month (working part-time) and will have to live on my own at another state (school is online). So that means 1/2 my earnings will go to rent so I can keep this internship going. On the flipside, if I leave after the summer I can go home and focus on school. Main issue for me is I feel I would leave this internship 1/2 completed. My issue is not totally on the money as I'm sure I can figure that out, but more of the hassle and stress induced to continue an internship just so I can keep face and continue my work (training will take 3/4th of the internship so that's why it's a co-op).

This is the highest ranking school that I got into, the others being a top 60 school with half the tuition cost and the **significantly** cheaper Georgia Tech OMSCS.

I would rather not do OMSCS due to the lack of research opportunities, but NYU comes out to  $73440 just in tuition (with off-campus rent/expenses it could easily be double that)!

On the bright side, the top tech companies hire from NYU significantly more than the other school I got into, but the price...

I have also done two technical internships at a defense company in Germany during my masters.The internship was more into deep learning for Lidar perception. I have also done 5 academic projects out of which 2 are in computer vision and rest in interfacing sensors to micro-controllers(embedded systems). So essentially I am fresh graduate.

So i have been giving interviews and grinding to find (Automotive) software engineering jobs in EU ( specifically Germany &amp; France ) since January 2020 but unfortunately haven't got any offers due to current pandemic situation.

In terms of my future job, I am interested in Embedded systems and equally also interested in Deep learning/Computer vision. I have good amount of knowledge in C/C++ and embedded systems in general. I do also have good knowledge about CNN/Deep learning but just basic python knowledge. Recently I have also started to learn embedded Linux-yocto just as a hobby.

Most of the jobs posted for computer vision require atleast a PhD degree for a fresh start but for embedded systems , masters or bachelors degree is enough coupled with some experience.

WGU has an extremely affordable CS degree. The program is weird in that it only requires Calc 1 but up to Discrete Math 2, which is the opposite of most schools I've seen. I have already taken Calc 2 though so I won't be missing anything as far that goes.


I am leaning towards the WGU route mainly because of the price difference and that it's actually a CS degree. Also, I could probably get it done faster than the CIS degree.

Hi everyone, hope you are doing well. I need your advice on making a difficult decision.

I'm currently an international student in the US. I've completed my course of study last year(MS in CS), and received an offer from a professor to perform research at school. I took up the offer, and have worked at school as a research assistant for about a year now. My work authorization is also about to expire soon. I now have 3 options, and would really appreciate it if anyone could provide me some guidance in this matter. 

1. Extending stay via further study programs: This is something the government is suggesting to students who are about to go out of status and are unable to travel back.

2. Extending stay via job authorization extension: Look into finding another temporary job that allows me to extend my stay for a while. (On campus jobs at my school are not possible, since the work authorization extension does not allow for that.) Honestly I've been looking into this option for a while but I've had no luck so far. (Did have a few interviews, yet to receive a response)

3. Travel back: This was originally my plan after completing my research work, but ever since the pandemic struck, I'm unable to make any travel plans due to restrictions, and unavailability of flights to my home country. 

I spoke to a few people and they suggested a pretty odd option of trying for ""consulting firms"". These companies can get the required extension done, but I researched into those and spoke to a few of them, and figured that isn't something I'm willing to go for, due to their shady business practices. [Here's an article about such companies.](https://www.stilt.com/blog/2018/01/dirty-truth-desi-consulting-companies/)

Please let me know what you think is better to go for at this point. Due to the pandemic, finding a job has become extremely hard, especially as an international student, due to sponsorship requirements by companies.

I've been reading a little bit about the immigration process. I know that H1B visas are probably the most common option for people in these sort of jobs, but I've also seen that there are more chances to get one if I do my masters in the US. And given that the immigration process is not really very straightforward, I would like to get some insight on how it was for you guys: how easy it was to get the visa, how long can it take, what qualifications you need, how recommended is it do study in the US to later apply for the visa... Just anything you want to say about it, really."
2859,cscareerquestions,How do you deal with co-workers?,"I'm an intern at a big company. Work is great, name looks very good on the resume but my team suck. My mentor is very nice though. 

But I dont have anything in common with anyone in the department. I just spent a year abroad in a country where people are a lot easier to talk to, maybe that's why I feel excluded here? 

Anyway,  the entire team eats lunch together but it's weird. There is a group of 5 people talking together and the rest is awkwardly listening.

As an intern, I felt like I had to eat with them to enhance my chances at a return offer. But I just sit there silently. 

I tried making friends with the other interns but same issue, they are cold and I don't feel any connection with them. 

Yesterday our manager announced a hiring freeze: no full time offers for the interns. Should I just stop bothering with making connections? Honestly I love the work, the pay is good, my hours are flexible, the management is nice too, it's just that I don't fit in my team.."
2860,cscareerquestions,Best way to spend summer for senior without internship?,"Hello! I am a (super) senior graduating in Fall 2020 and was wondering what is the best way to spend my summer. I can officially say I couldn't land an internship and I currently have no work experience whatsoever. I went to a good CS school, but not that great of a GPA. I have a couple of cool projects already and I'm going to be working on more projects and making my GitHub profile stand out more.

Besides projects, what else should I be doing to strengthen my chances of finding a entry level position after I graduate? I've done a lot of leetcode (maybe a little too much lol) and I'm confident I can pass an interview. I'm just wondering if there is anything a new grad with no work experience can do to increase their chances of receiving interviews when applying. Thank you!

They're needlessly esoteric.,"I have 8 years of experience, A referral from somebody that works there, and I applied to a lower level administrative role and I still got rejected. I was told it was based on the pre-screen questions but who knows.

I'm going to try to word the question here I can barely remember it it was so goofy. Then I'll give it an analogy as to like why it's even difficult for me to remember.

""How many bits are in the ownership flag of a permission mask?""

It was something like that. To me that's a goofy question I'm not really sure what it is demonstrating. In 8 years I've never cared about how many bits are in any portion of the mask. I feel like a more constructive question would be 

""I want to set execute for owner, and read only for other and group using a mask. What's a command to accomplish that?""

It would demonstrate the understanding of permissions from execution versus from its underlying structure. I get its Google but I would wonder how many people care about the underlying structure of a permission mask day to day.

It'd be like I want to go to a url and I ask my colleague ""What is the ascii representation for the domain of 172.217.164.174?"" vs Whats the site for google?"" the former doesn't make any sense, it's not how people talk."

We had a week off for a designated holiday but he basically worked through it since they needed him for another project. As soon as I came back, he pulled me into a call and told me about features X and Y that I needed to add alongside feature Z which he was working on.

The plan was to integrate X, Y, and Z into v0.3 when we were both done. Well I was done with X &amp; Y 2 days ago, and moved on to other projects where I was needed.

I checked his latest commit last night and found out he only put X in v0.3, so I explained to him why he also needed Y. He proceeded to put Y but completely transformed the functionality, removing most of the groundwork and completely manipulating the intended use which the PM had relayed to me. I informed him of this and he said he'd double check with our PM. 

He only put parts of it back, and now when testing starts it'll be clear this isn't the intended behavior. I'm worried it'll be my ass then, since he's too stubborn to listen to me when I say these are the requirements relayed to me. I made sure to be very polite and professional, only telling him ""hey W, PM told me this is how this should work: should change line 42 from this to that.""

I find it very frustrating to continuously work on things I was assigned to only to have him completely change it around and tell me ""thanks! We finished this thanks to you."" It seems very patronizing when pretty much none of my code's even in the project. This only ever happens with this person. I'd understand if he were adjusting for efficiency, but he just changes variable names and transforms the functionality."

In the world of Software Engineering this is a horrible trait to have in my opinion. Just the simple act of initializing a new project is a bombardment of new information. Installing the libraries associated with a project is another assault. In my experience, attempting to absorb too much information on a new topic leads to very little being retained.

At a high level such actions are really simple, you're issuing a command to create files for a skeleton project and then you're asking a tool to fetch and install the libraries that are listed in a file. However, rather than focusing on the commands and the high level concepts my brain panics and begins to look at the files generated for the project, or the libraries being installed and what they do. Keep in mind at this point the project is just a skeleton and I haven't even used the framework yet.

2880,cscareerquestions,Got a job offer in this pandemic but I need advice - Background Check issue,"Hello,

So this week has been a rollercoaster for me. I finished my last course (3 week summer course) and got a job offer for a good company with great pay, signed my offer letter and got a start date.

My issue is that my new employeer is doing a background check which I assume includes proof of education, and my university told me this morning that since I technically finished my last class in summer (although I would've walked with spring graduates) my degree won't get awarded or ""conferred"" until **August 14th.** 

I do not know what to do or who to talk to about this, the person I talked to with my university suggested I email/call my advisor and see if they can get me any sort of proof after explaining my situation, I sent them an email and called but I know because of the current situation I will be in a long queue of people trying to speak her.

I am so scared and really need advice on who to talk to, the job I got isn't a government job so I am unsure how strict they are about a degree needing to be posted before starting. I know even people who graduated traditionally in mid May at my university still don't have their degrees conferred because of the current situation, so I am not sure what I can do.

Does anyone have advice on what to do, who to talk to and if this is something that may get my signed offer letter rescinded? I genuinely did not know this would even be an issue or that getting a degree ""conferred"" was a thing. I talked to my future new boss the day I signed the offer letter and let him know that my school seems behind the curve on this stuff even with May graduates, but at the time of our conversation I did not know the severity of my situation.

Any advice is appreciated, 

Thank you"

But I still feel very lost when it comes to the overall functioning of the system. Sometimes I'll go look at a 1000 line function with 7 levels of indentation and I just feel like quitting.

I'm considering offering an agreement where instead of purely at-will employment, for a period of 2-3 years he's bound to keep me and I'm bound to stay. Factoring in whatever exceptions make sense.

In principle I'm committed to the idea and I think he will be, too. We've had a good relationship and it's in a particularly good place now.

In practice, is this a thing, in this field? Outside of sports and entertainment? Is there a common model to follow for this kind of contract in technology? What should I be aware of? Is there anything I can read?

I'm not talking about a contract in the sense of moving to an hourly rate, but keeping the same employee situation with a modification.

I wouldn't have done this earlier in my career, but I'm 40 and I've had plenty of variety in my career and right now I value stability over the freedom to look for a new job. I have some real estate decisions to make that could go more easily if I knew a few years of employment stability in the same place were guaranteed.

2897,cscareerquestions,Advice on choosing a specialization/starting my career,"**Background:**

I am a new grad with a Computer Engineering degree, which IMO means I'm even more general and less skilled than a general CS degree. I am not interested in a career on the hardware side, but I don't really know what kind of career I want in tech. 

I had an IT internship that did not interest me at all, but that *could* have been because I had 0 background in what my team was doing and unrealistic expectations. 

I was fortunate-ish to receive a great job offer for ""Junior Software Engineer"", but that has since been rescinded due to the virus. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Situation:**

I feel like I was first applying to Software Engineering jobs because it seemed not too narrow a field and creative enough to be interesting. But since my offer was rescinded I'm taking the chance to do *what I wish I'd done in college* and think about what kind of career I want. 

I'm the kind of person who doesn't like having a sea of options in front of me- I'd really like to find something specific, like Database Administration, and say ""That sounds like a great path for me!"" and just focus on learning those skills and applying to those jobs. I realize this may be unrealistic. 

The other options I've been considering have been taking a few classes to eventually get a Masters, or take some certificate programs (though the FAQ says they are usually not useful- [https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq\_certifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_certifications)). **However, I don't want a Master's degree unless I'm certain it will be in the right area for my career.**

I graduated with  CS degree in December of 2018. I had a focus in Cyber Security, while being very active in hacking competitions, both redteam and blueteam. I fell in love with blueteam side of things, using very modern tech (think Kubernetes) to automate defense and response. I've also been developing many side projects with more ""hot"" technology. I'll list a few down below to get an idea.

My goal is to rotate out of the boring, monotonous job I have right now (Information Security Analyst) which is basically watching for alerts that our SIEM fires off. Looking at the people around me in my position, I don't even think advancing up the ladder will give me what I want. After working in ""IT"" for a bit, I've realized that ""IT"" and ""CompSci"" are very two different things. *Using* tools and *developing* tools are very different work types, the latter of which actually being somewhat rewarding and interesting. I feel like all my coworkers, even the 20 year veterans that I work with, to be blunt, aren't too sharp and are behind the times. I feel like I'm going to fall in the same place as them.

I'm looking for a job where I can do development on React apps, use Kubernetes, integrate with Elastic Stack, mainly just *exist with code*. I've gone my entire post-graduate career without having *code* anywhere in my job description and its KILLING me.

My issue is that every job posting for things like DevOps, SRE, FrontEnd/Full Stack developer all want formal experience doing those, even ""Entry"" positions. I promise I know this stuff way better than many of the ""entry level"" people, as I've worked really hard to teach myself. CKE certification doesn't seem to pull much weight, sadly.

I'm also in co-op which means I have worked full time at GIS based companies where I normally end up writing Fullstack/Frontend GIS web apps. These are customer facing fullstack apps built by me and used in production today.

During my time at these co-ops I've realized I prefer software development to what my major is. I've put in a ton of work outside of school and I would consider myself an intermediate fullstack dev although that has never been my official job title. 

During the early covid season I wrote an open source app when I was not in school. Around the same time an engineering friend from school recommended I apply to a certain startup. Fast forward to today, I was contacted by an investor who saw my project on github and wants to help me scale it into a business. Additionally I was the successful candidate at this startup after 20+ applicants interviewed and they have offered me a position as a lead dev.

After school has kicked into gear in the past 2 weeks or so, I feel like it is a total waste of my time, especially when I am studying something only somewhat related to CS. I really want to drop out so I can focus on these other opportunities, but my parents are devoutly against the idea. They both had a lot of schooling in their time. They say I only have 2 semesters remaining and that I will regret it.

From my point of view, I think I will regret it if I turn down these other opportunities to focus on a major I am less passionate about. There is no way in hell I can manage school on top of these. I know both of these opportunities are not really 'stable' but I would assume this proves I could have success in the field without a degree.

2905,cscareerquestions,First job!,"Hello everyone!

I am a lurker here for the past months but now that I finally found a job... I need your opinion :(

Basically, I got hired in January, for an IT company in Bulgaria. The boss (in the interview) said ""You will undergo training for 3-4 weeks"". I said ""yeah that's fine"". After I got hired though... there is not training at all! What I mean is that I have a ""supervisor"" (well sort of...) and I did petty stuff at first, like copy-pasting some code or generally doing menial stuff. That's ok I guess because I was new.

Fast forward 3 months and.... I am totally ignored! I have completed ONE project in 3+ months and nothing else. I am always saying ""Hey, what is there for me to do?"" and there is never a direct answer. There was a week where I was literally doing nothing, that is... NOTHING, and now that we are at a work at home programme, I just turned on the corporate laptop to show that I am online and ... I turned on my home computer and played some games. There is no training at all, I am trying to learn stuff alone, guessing some stuff and examining the code.

Some people may say ""That's nice! You get paid to do NOTHING!"" but for me it sucks! I am jealous that coworkers know a lot of stuff and are fixing bugs in production for customers, while I am doing nothing and not helping.

Has this ever happened to anyone? What am I supposed to do?

Thank you for your time"
2906,cscareerquestions,"I don't like too much my current job, but I don't have alternatives in my country","I live in Italy and I work as a software engineer for an IT consultant company.

I don't like too much my current job because I don't have a real team, I'm in a group with my manager and a senior SDE that works also for other projects, so I'm alone for almost all time.

I see they are not passionate about computer science like me, they simply just do the minimal work to get the things works. Instead, I always try to give my best because I am never satisfied with the quality of my work, I always want to go further.

I would like to solve complex problems, discuss the best solutions with the team, focus on code quality and deliver the best product to the customer (not only the working product).

I miss all these things... and here in Italy, that kind of companies does not exist, and I am scared to go out of Italy because of my English skills.

2908,cscareerquestions,I'm rusty as hell when it comes to C++ and am getting destroyed on Hackerranks. Am I screwed/any recommended ways to brush up on things?,"Hey all,

A bit of a vent, but I'm graduating from a top 10 school by the end of the year and have yet to have any job experience in any sort of related field. I'm not a CS major (I'm CE), but software dev is something I regularly apply to due to the overlap in classes I have with the major (I took a more programming oriented route). I was pretty confident with my ability to code in C++ last year, but after a year of classes primarily focusing on Python and C, I've come to realize that I'm mad rusty when it comes to coding in C++ now, to the point that many Hackerranks that I would have somewhat breezed through are now stumping me.

I was wondering if I should just pack things up or if there's still a chance that I can get back on the saddle this Summer. And if the latter is true, I was also wondering if there were any helpful sources you guys used when brushing up on concepts."
2909,cscareerquestions,"~ 6 years dev experience, potential to move to Technical PM role","Hey all,

For a few years now I've had a goal to get into the management side of development. I was recently approached by my current employer to see if I was interested in a Technical Product Manager position. I'd never considered this route and I'm not sure if it would hurt or help me in the long run.

I'm pretty comfortable with the responsibilities (I had to pick up the slack from a pretty terrible, now terminated PM for my team and on my current project I've been doing that plus normal dev work with some assistance from a PM to handle a lot of the more mundane client interactions). In short, I know I can do the job well.

I'm concerned how it might impact future opportunities and the optics, and whether or not this hurts or helps. Ultimately I'd like to be recognized as management within a company (and my rather shallow perspective of PMs are basically just account managers.)

When I moved here, I got € 65k and a marginal moving + visa help bonus.
But I've come to realise this company is a little too toxoc and I want to move.

But after exploring of various sites like numbeo, Glassdoor, LinkedIn salary tool, it seems what I'm getting here is indeed the general average and I can't look for getting any more when switching.

I've had one company send regrets because my salary was more than their scope for a similar position.

I wish to understand what kind of salary can I look for for my position here in Germany. Or if QA really is a niche market in Germany then should I look to switch to development?

What're the sensible salaries for devs with a good skill set at 5 - 6 years exp?

Also, is there some extra perks which I should really look out for apart from salary? Like Bahn Cards etc?"

Need some suggestions,"This is a pretty cliched question, but I think that my situation is a little different. I have completed the Discrete Math course (6.042J) from MIT cow, and have a solid grasp on that. I have also done some competitive coding in the past (almost a year ago. I had taken a hiatus from CS stuff as I hit a plateau). I have good grasp of C++ and Python Basics. And, to top that off I am majoring in EE and I am a sophomore ( currently my summer break thanks to the existing situation). So, I have enough time (45 odd days) to finish one full length course in Data Structures and Algorithms.

I had explored these options before:

SMA5503 of MIT cow (Finished 3 lectures) with CLRS as supplement.

Now I had a dilemma with these two options:

Whether to go ahead and complete SMA 5503 or take 6.006 and 6.042J (2015 version).

I wanted a comparison as to which option will help me to get enough of an overview in the major DS and Algo topics, so that I can practise on my own.

Also, is there any other option that you would suggest (I would like a course based approach as I tend to focus and get the job done better). I intend this to help me implement most of the basic algorithm techniques used. (Preferred language being Python..., C++ is the second preference)"

 (TL;DR at the bottom)

&amp;#x200B;

|My Bachelor's Degree|

Graduated with a Bachelor's in Business back in 2015 from a state university and worked at a finance company making $40k/yr. Quit after working for a year cause I hated it and thought it was miserable. Either that or it might have been the fact I was young and stupid worrying about being trapped in an office rather than ""living the life"" like the other 20-somethings going out to bars every weekend and traveling abroad every other week. I went to restaurant work because I had worked as a waiter all throughout college anyway, at the fine dining steakhouse I was promoted to Liquor Sales Manager in 2017 making about $65k/yr.

Everything was great! Met my fiancé, bought a nice townhome here in Florida with low cost of living, and no debt other than mortgage. Then come Covid-19. I was laid off April 21 and have been receiving unemployment benefits ever since. However, they called me back today to let me know to come back to work. Because I'm highly asthmatic, me and my fiancé decided it was time for a career change and not stay in a work environment with high levels of physical interaction with multiple people at a time. I had a professional talk with my General Manager and ended it on REALLY GOOD terms (I'm a hard worker and never complain at work. What else do you want in an employee ya know?).  
 I've always been a huge nerd with all things tech and I absolutely love math. Which then led me to Computer Science. Win-win right? HOPEFULLY!  


|Research|

After doing about 2 months of research (most of it was fear of trying something out completely new and failing), I think I have a pretty good understanding of the industry and the many specializations within.

From my research of the CURRENT job market in Northeast Florida, the software engineering jobs I've come across tend to focus on data warehousing or information technology (J2EE, J2SE, etc.).

Initially, I wanted to pursue that ""hip, young, modern"" tech startup you see all over those ""day in the life of a software engineer"" but that scene doesn't seem really prominent here in the Southeast. And because we have an established living situation, I'm gonna have to cut ""relocation"" as an option, which I know, will hinder me greatly in finding a job.

&amp;#x200B;

|Learning Material / Study / Finances|

I decided to follow the curriculum from [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) . No particular reason really, except the fact that they just RECENTLY updated their curriculum and that it really seems like the material listed is of high quality.

Fortunately, we have $16k in emergency savings and my fiancé JUST found a banking job. We won't be making nearly as much, but in the middle of a pandemic that's more than acceptable.

While she works, I will be committing more than 40 hours a week studying and following the curriculum. Hopefully I can make significant process in the coming months. Read on to see why.

&amp;#x200B;

|School...?|

My state university offers a Masters in CompSci with a concentration in either of these 3 fields:

Information Technology - Computer Science Theory - Software Engineering

Now obviously, doing 2 months of research I've come across multiple threads and opinion YT videos on self-taught vs. coding bootcamp vs school.  
 After considering all the above, I've decided to do a hybrid approach.

As I mentioned before, I will be mainly using [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) as my resource and hopefully I can get a few projects done. Once winter hits, I will be looking to apple for the Master's in CompSci program. I have yet to determine which concentration. You would think software engineering, but my region's main industry focus seems to revolve around information technology so I'm not quite sure yet. I have to be realistic rather than idealistic.

I know I know. ""You don't need a degree!"" 

Youtubers have said it. Redditors have said it. Even the FAANG companies have said it. Despite MOST (not all) of them having a relevant degree. 

I don't have data for this at all, but for some reason I feel like it'll open up more opportunities for more in the future especially when the economy bounces back up, Which it will, because historical data shows economic success after recessions.

I don't plan to entirely rely on a Master's to get my foot in the door. Instead, I plan to produce a few impactful projects come October. Why October? Read on.

&amp;#x200B;

|Career Fair|

That's right. My university holds a yearly career fair for Undergrads, Grads, AND Alumni (woo!). Although my university is more centered on its business fields of study, tech is everywhere! From what I've seen and heard in the past, these career fairs are usually packed with companies eagerly waiting to get their next cheap labor (sorry I mean productive and academically-outstanding workers with a thirst for knowledge in the field).

I've looked into a lot of material regarding successful interactions at career fairs and I honestly believe I can present myself pleasantly to recruiters. I mean, I've worked 4 years as a sales manager in a fine dining setting and have seen and interacted with any type of person you can think of.

Maybe I can also throw in I'm looking to do my Master's to further express my desire to flourish in this new field? Not sure how that will look yet still thinking more into this step. If I could get even an unpaid internship during these times that would be phenomenal.

&amp;#x200B;

|December 2020|

At this point we'll see where I am with my CS skills, the recruiters at the Career Fair, and my admission status with the University. If I have to make some modifications through the plan then so be it!

I'm excited to be jumping into this new chapter of my life!

&amp;#x200B;

Sooooooo.....any thoughts? :D 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR

Changing careers at 26. Gonna self-study for a few months using [teachyourselfcs.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com) with the intent of studying more than 40 hrs a week. My fiancé was able to get a job in banking and we have a pretty good amount of savings and cost of living is low. THANKFUL!

Come October, visit my University Career Fair and try to get internships. If nothing by December, apply for Master's in CompSci program and we'll see from there."

I have 1 year of professional experience as a full-stack developer and I received 2 job offers for node.js backend developer. Each has its pros and cons, so here we go:

Option 1:

* Med size company (60 emp.)
* Average salary
* Junior Dev position
* National company
* They use a lot of microservices with AWS (lambda functions and others) and Docker, technologies I have never worked with, so I will learn a lot. However, they told me they switched to this architecture from monolith PHP 2+ years ago, so they may not be ""expert"" at node.js

Option 2:

* [Unicorn company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn_(finance))
* High salary
* Semi-Senior Dev position
* International company
* The issue with this company is that I don't know what project (they have tens) I will be placed in. I could end up in a project with old technologies and badly developed, or I could end up in a good one

The money isn't a quite important factor for me though.

I mainly want to develop myself as a programmer and I want to become a Backend Architect in the future. I thought that for the option 1 I could have the chance to learn a lot because it's not a big company and my impact will be higher, however in option 2 I might find more experienced developers? I don't know.

Finally, I actually open the code itself and walk them through the major pieces and explain how each piece accomplished the value I was speaking to up front.

That being said, I've always wanted to go to graduate school. My undergrad is in business but I took several quantitative and database design courses which is how I ended up as a director of analytics. I've most recently assumed cybersecurity responsibilities (I work for a small company). My two options that I have narrowed it down to are as follows:

1.) UPenn's MCIT, to seek formal CS education on topics that I have read about and not dug too deeply into to, can lead to an executive software engineering masters if my career progresses that direction. Like others have mentioned, MCIT is like a CS associates + with some masters courses.

2.) UT Dallas's Executive Masters in Systems Engineering/Management, where I can concentrate on Database systems and information assurance. More quantitatively focused than the MCIT, and can add more cybersecurity courses too.

My outcome would be to become a VP of analytics, VP of data engineering, VP of research... or if I decide to quit the management path, I could become a cybersecurity or data engineer (those are the two avenues I currently live in most of the time). Ultimately, my career goal would be a CISO, CIO, CDA, or CTO.

Basically, I have some professional experience working with large companies as a product design intern and I was unable to get extended due to COVID-19. The job search has been really fruitless and honestly, I'm still traumatized from trying to get my first internships right out of school(2019 grad here). It's competitive AF for design. I have an engineering degree and have taken coding classes(web dev, data structures and algorithms and Java and Python) and noticed companies were more willing to give me coding challenges in contrast to the amount of UX jobs I've applied to. 

With COVID 19's affect on the industry, I'm feeling it might be a better choice to switch to being a software engineer and may be statistically better for employment. The downside is I only have experience in those classes programming and know how to solve basic coding challenge questions, and don't know exactly what kind of knowledge full time positions want.

my question is, **is it worth trying to get my gpa over a 3.5?** **like how big of a deal is it that i dont have latin honors or whatever?** im getting the vibe from this site that gpa barely matters at all you pretty much only need a 3.0, 3.5 in very rare cases.

2941,cscareerquestions,Question about APIs,"Hello, I am currently new to learning coding/SWE and learning about HTML/CSS/jQuery.  


While trying to create a simple website, I stumbled upon this prompt:

""You may have already discovered that web browsers come with a built-in JavaScript API for manipulating an HTML page's layout. This is huge-- the ability to control a page's content using JavaScript means that we can dynamically modify what users see based on input, requests to servers, and provide all sorts of other useful facilities.

But if you've tried to use the browser's API, you may have noticed that it's complex, sometimes unintuitive, and -- worst of all -- its behavior and feature set \[vary wildly across browsers\]\[\].

Enter jQuery!

*\[jQuery\]\[\]* is a library that offers significant improvements on top of the native browser API, making manipulating your documents far easier.""  


1.First of all, I was not able to find in Chrome where I can find the 'built-in JavaScript API for manipulating an HTML pages layout.' In the console, I skimmed over the Elements/Network/Sources panel but could not find the built-in JS API. **Where can I find this info in my browser?**  


2. To my knowledge, libraries are files we can download(like underscore.js) and if put inside the project directory(same folder), we can use them. So by downloading the jQuery file, it allows methods and event-handlers in jQuery API documentation site to work. Now, I don't quite understand what an API does, why it is necessary, and the big role it plays in the computer and network system, such as its relationship to the server or database.(actually I'm not even solid on what a 'server' or 'database' is lol).   


The definition on wikipedia of API is the following:  
""An **application programming interface** (**API**) is a [computing interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_(computing)) which defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.""

Now I know that a computing interface is "" a shared boundary across which two or more separate components of a [computer system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_system) exchange information. The exchange can be between [software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software), [computer hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_hardware), [peripheral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral) devices, [humans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface), and combinations of these.""  


So in this case, the computing interface is between the interaction between human and the browser. 

**I just don't see why and how ""*****\[jQuery\]\[\]*** **is a library that offers significant improvements on top of the native browser API, making manipulating your documents far easier.""**  


I would really appreciate if someone could explain this! I guess this is why a CS degree is important (I lack the cs fundamentals) haha  


Thank you!!"
2942,cscareerquestions,When did you notice changes in your managers tone towards you before you got fired or reprimanded?,"The company i’ve been working for, for about 1.5 years, just hired a few new devs, all being paid at least $20k more than me, bad on me for not negotiating. 

Lately, i’ve been on my own completing tasks, i’ll be given some super vague task, not a story, not a set of tasks making a feature, but just like a ticket with a title like “Allow users to make reports by Factor xyz”. I would ask for guidance, more info, other stuff to really make sure i don’t have to redo this. Very few replies, but they told me to just get it done.

So today i demo it, and they completely ripped it to shreds. They hated everything. They said it was slow (the api was fast, my computer isn’t very fast so everything seemed slow..) and pretty much that the UI sucked. I apologized and didn’t hear an even “well we didn’t tell you enough info” like usually do after something like this. 

I honestly can’t believe it, i hate that they don’t give me any information, design or anything to go off of for features, and expect me to know what they want. Then get pissed at me when they don’t like it and make me redo it. This has been happening for my entire time i’ve been working here, not every task, but about 50% of them. 

Today was another time when i heard my manager speak to me like this, not like i was stupid, but just as if they were disappointed. I’ve been hearing it more and more lately, but the mood shifts when new hires hop on the call. The CTO has been been mentioning me as if i ‘worked’ there.

2946,cscareerquestions,The TCS experience,"Hi fellow nerds!

&amp;#x200B;

First, a bit of background:

Finished undergrad May 2019, GIS with CS minor, top 10 US public school

Worked for a startup as a mobile app dev after graduating, also started GT's OMSCS program

Last fall I was actively improving my interviewing skills. First few interviews I failed the first coding questions and phone screens. As time went on, I started making second rounds, and even third rounds. I also made effort into building some side projects. However, by Feb 2020, I decided to leave my startup and I joined TCS as ""software engineer"". At the time, my thinking was I'd gain decent experience with TCS while working on my masters and also looking for better opportunities. Honestly, I felt a bit exhausted continuously interviewing with companies and just wanted to work a decently paid role for a while. And then, of course, coronavirus happened, and no more interviews. While I'm thankful that I'm still employed, I am very worried about my career growth because during the past 4 months I have gained little to no development experience working for TCS. Turns out I'm not actually a ""software engineer""- most of my daily work involves application support for a big finance company. While I'm still learning a lot, I'm not getting to write any production code, and almost every single one of my coworkers are non-US citizens with very thick South Asian accents. I feel out of place. They are in it for the H1-B visa process, while I'm stuck here wondering how to get out of this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving forward, how much of a negative (or positive) impact will TCS have on my resume? Should I just stick with TCS until I finish my masters in 2021? Or should I find a better opportunity ASAP? Do I even mention TCS on my resume?"

2956,cscareerquestions,"Math major transition into CS, help figure out next steps?","I’m a senior at UCLA who’ll soon graduate with a B.S. in applied mathematics. I initially applied to the CS department (with a secondary choice of math) but they only admitted me into the math program. My GPA (so far) is 3.8 and I have just one more quarter left to graduate. The pace of the math program at UCLA is too intense and did not leave any room to properly apply to jobs and hone my interviewing skills.

I have a lot of difficulty with Leetcode problems, and my coding has atrophied due to only doing math during the last two years. UCLA has given me no actionable skills, and I feel I’m not at all ready for industry. I don’t know if I’m depressed or if the window of opportunity really is closing on a career in CS for me. But I feel like it’s over before it even began, and I’m 25. 

What should be my next steps? People say do projects and grind Leetcode, but I wouldn’t even know where to begin with projects. What technologies should I use? I have a little bit of  front-end knowledge and I can design websites really well (I am artsy), but other than that I don’t know much. 

I did an internship at an automation company for 1.5 years where they had me do various tasks. Some of them involved using bash (piping commands and stuff) and others were more web design related. But it wasn’t anything concrete and it left me more puzzled about this industry... 

Please give me an overview of the various CS career tracks, and help me figure out my next steps. What should I specialize in if I enjoy the creative aspects of the job more so than the problem solving ones? Should I do a masters in CS to get started? Should I sign up for a bootcamp? Any advice is appreciated, I really have no sense of direction now.

2960,cscareerquestions,Graduate Role Rotation,"Hey Guys,

So i started a 2 year graduate program back in August last year with a large global bank based out of the UK. As part of the program we get the chance to rotate into a different role after 12 months. Its a clean break, just up and move to try something else out for a year. 

The move is totally optional and i'm completely torn over what to do. I change my mind every 5 minutes

My current team are all based in a different location from me and the team is a little understaffed. This makes shadowing / coaching and training quite difficult. But the work is comfortable although not super exciting.

If I were to move, we submit some preferences on what we would like to do, then get assigned a role closer to the time. This kinda makes it a shot in the dark as to if its better or worse than what you had before. 

As a new grad I'm not super sure exactly what I was to settle on as my main tech stack. Do you guys think its better to:
* Do the move, get exposure of other areas and techs. (its only a year after all) I'd previously done some mobile dev and API work which i found interesting.
* Stick with the current, get 2 years experience in one area and get good at it (Its a java back, angular front webapp. There's a chance the project goes global and gets a lot bigger, I'd maybe be kicking myself for missing out on that)

We're guaranteed a permanent job at the end of the graduate program anyway, so i don't need to worry about re-applying etc.

Thanks"

Now, I am making around 35k for 40h/week, whereas the new job asks for 37h/week. I calculated the hourly rate and come up with the minimum to ask for 37h/w. That obviously mean I will will work less and thus earn less.

2974,cscareerquestions,"QuantFinance after PhD in CS (I am not a ""conventional"" candidate)","Hi guys! 

I am interested in working as a quant in hedge funds after my PhD graduation (3-4 years from now). 

I would like to hear what I should do to get there given my stats. 

I have undergrad in EE, in circuit design. I worked as a circuit design engineer for 4 years at top companies (like Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc). Then I decided, as I always wanted, to go for a PhD. I was torn between Networks and Hardware Security. I was accepted to a MSc/PhD program with focus on Networks. I finished my MSc there and realised it was not the best choice for me. I switched to the PhD in Hardware assisted security - we work on compilers, microarchitecture solutions, and so on. Now I am in my 2nd year of a program and I love it. 

Given the fact that I had no programming (EE as undergrad) experience in my BSc studies, now I focus on gaining more knowledge with C++ and compilers. I took 3 classes so far: Algorithms, C++, and Compilers. The class on Algorithms was really tough (B+ only), but C++ and Compilers - A. I really liked all of them. I liked to work on LLVM passes for optimizations and on a C++ project in my C++ class. Next semester I plan to take a class that focuses on functional programming, I am very interested in it. 

I have a good understanding/experience of how to work in big teams (well, I worked with big teams), different people, and so on. I have been living alone since I was 18, paid for my own education, did military service (before I moved to the USA), and volunteered with kids in cancer affected families for 5 years (don't know whether it's important or not, and how to “sell” it). 

So: 

1. I am not a conventional BSc/MSc grad looking for a job in their 20s. I am 34 now. 
2. I have no deep knowledge on data structures, programming, and never did any internship in a SW company. 
3. All my experience is from research (C++ as a tool), and classes. 

What should I do in the next 2 years to be sure I have a good chance of getting into companies like 2Sigma?

Thank you for your feedback and advice!"

The dream would be to work in San Francisco/Bay Area upon graduation, as my internship is not in that area, but it seems like I might be spinning my wheels a little bit when applying. Before the world went bananas, I would spend so much time researching and applying to random companies in the Bay and doing leetcode, probably sent out around 50-75 applications with cover letters and all that. After either not hearing back or hearing back saying that they are going to look for other candidates, I realized sending out applications to companies I have no connection to whatsoever might be a waste of time. So I started to reach out to people on LinkedIn who graduated from my University and work at companies in the Bay. I know its just a start, but I reached out to about 20 and haven't heard back from any of them.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess the real question is, does sending out many applications to random companies work? Or do you need to go the connections route like I started to try? Or both? Is there anything else I might consider trying? I have a good GPA, have past internship experience, and am getting pretty good at LeetCode, and I am not saying that at all to inflate my ego or whatever a lot of people do on this subreddit, I am just unsure what I am doing wrong here. Just wanted to sort of pick a firm course of action before I start trying everything out. Thanks."

I also think that I used to be more excited and look forward to code in the early months of my job. I thought our code is well-maintained and my tech lead is like the best coder. But then after I work for 2-3 months, my tech lead left the company and a new CTO came in. Its revealed that maybe my tech lead isn't that perfect (me understanding better of my company's software, my new CTO being more experienced than the previous tech lead, etc.)

Nowadays in my job i feel everytime I create a PR im playing jenga. Our system is like a pile of jenga blocks and im stacking another block and the whole thing is fragile. This is due to a task that i was responsible with but although my code logic is correct, my other senior who didnt review my code said this subproject is a joke (idk if hes talking about my logic or what the client wants, but he isnt rude or blaming me or anything) my current implementation logic make the thing works but when we render a webpage it become very slow ? And although nobody is blaming me for anything and they r helping me to fix it i just feel hopeless and feel like stacking jenga blocks everyday


I am feeling very very very low about myself, i feel like im a stupid lazy ass good for nothing. Im very upset at myself because i am from a private university that is not popular with low rank worldwide and only 3 years programme and although i graduate with 3.9 gpa, i didnt do study outside of my university course scope and didnt do any self projects simply because i didnt know such thing exists and is important and there was so much time wasted playing games and burying myself in depression

I wish i could go to work knowing how to do all the tasks that i have to do at that day but truth is most time spent clueless and feeling pity for myself and although i didnt ask many questions to my seniors, i just create a PR and hope my seniors are smart enough to help me recognize flaws

Conclusion is my self esteem is already a mess to begin with but i feel this is not an imposter syndrome and i dont deserve to be confident because im a stupid ass and not able to get out of this loophole.

Hope you guys are doing well. So I'm a CS grad at a top 30 school and I lost internship opportunity  because of this pandemic situation. Now I'm really worried that I won’t get an opportunity as we are 6 days already in May. I've accepted this and I've decided that I will gain new skills over summer. I researched and realized that lots of people end up doing personal projects over summer and that adds a lot to the resume. My goal is to land a co-op opportunity or/and a full time offer after I graduate next summer. But I have a few questions :

1. IS there any resource where we can collaborate for projects? Say something where like minded people come together to work on an idea? 
2. Also is it true that projects done in collaboration with any org or prof will have more weightage over a similar individually done project?
3. Can someone also point out resources which may have links to good hackathons and competitive coding competitions  which will add weight to my resume?
4. What are the level of projects which will add value or catch the eye of recruiter when applying for big n's. ex : I saw a video about a guy who listed out his projects which landed him an interview at google. Those projects were well executed but not innovative. I'm really unable to put my finger on the complexity of projects that should be listed on resume for big n's.

I'm really grateful in advance for all the answers and IF someone knows about a good opportunity for a project over the summer, I would be more than happy to discuss that.

Cheers everyone and STAY SAFE!"
2991,cscareerquestions,Does your degree matter when seeking CS related employment?,"I'm choosing between universities right now as I start in September. Many of the different universities are offering different bachelor degrees for their CS program. Some examples are:

- Bachelor of Computer Science (BCS)
- Bachelor of Science (BSc)
- Bachelor of Computing (BComp)
-Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc)

Does your degree matter when pursuing a career related to CS and SEng? (All the programs are teaching more or less the same courses)"
2992,cscareerquestions,How did you determine your chosen career path?,"Im in my last year of university, and I'm kinda experiencing some anxiety on what I'm going to do with my degree. I love being a CS major for multiple reasons, and I'm proud of myself for coming so far, but I think I've hit a wall of some sort. I'm not entirely sure what I want to do with my degree, lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I've created games, worked on robots, and various other projects that I thought were super interesting, but I have no idea what area I want to focus on. It all sounds so amazing, but I'm afraid I'll make the wrong decision. Anyone have advice on how you ended up where you are?"

2994,cscareerquestions,Is it out of line to ask for profit from an intern project?,"I intern at a smallish company developing software with a team of a couple other interns. The research, development, and testing to create the product was done solely by the intern team.

Would it be stupid to ask for a raise or a cut profits from the software when it goes to market (royalty i guess?) or will I just get laughed out the door? I know it's their intellectual property and excuse me if i sound entitled for a project i've built. 

The company has generally been very good to me and the team of interns, but we do not get paid a lot (less than $20/hr at around 10 hours a week), and I know the clients looking for the software will be paying handsomely.

Is it better to just not worry about it an hedge my bets that I may get hired when i get my degree?"

However, it seems to revolve around the 'Advent Geneva' platform, based around .NET / C# development, and that you will be trained up to become an 'Advent Geneva' specialist.

The job description seems to emphasise writing up reports (SSRS), but after some research, I noticed that Geneva has it's own report format called RSL.

Just wondering if anyone here has ever worked with Advent Geneva, as I can't find too much info on it and wondering if it's possibly a career limiting move, to work with this platform? I would just be concerned about being pigeon-holed."
2999,cscareerquestions,Accept new offer or hunker down,"Background: Software engineer, East coast, No degree, 2 years experience. I make $95k at my first job.

My current company claimed they would not lay anyone off, then laid off 10% of the company 2 weeks later. I took that as a warning sign and began looking for new jobs. I just got an offer for another company for $110k with a bigger company (not massive) working in the ad sector. This company has not had any layoffs and they say they're trying to expand the part of the company I'd be working for (another company which they acquired a couple years ago). They tell me $110k is more than they wanted to spend, but that they were enthusiastic about me anyways (which could of course be lip service).

Obviously, on paper, I should take the offer. However, my worry is about job security. I'm afraid that if I'm a highly paid new employee and orders come down from the top to start chopping heads, the new guy will be first in line. I'm also wary of the history of the sector I'm working in. Is the ad market doing well? poorly? The part of the company that was acquired was bankrupt before they bought it.

What would you do? Take the offer, take a higher salary, or hunker down since I have SOME degree of rapport with my current company? Does the 10% layoff at my company mean I DEFINITELY should take another offer?"

I want to begin interviewing at other places but realize that the hiring atmosphere is not ideal. Being holed up at home and finding my responsibilities increasing while I am on meetings all day is getting to me and my relationships, and I'm feeling that this company is taking me for granted and it could be a stressful next few months :(

3005,cscareerquestions,Does working in big tech make it any easier to get into graduate programs?,"To keep it concise:

* Been working at a small company as a software developer since graduation
* Was just hired at a top 5 tech company as a software engineer (think Google, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.)
* End goal is to work for a couple of years but eventually get into a graduate program for something CS related (machine learning / data science)

Will my position at a top tech company make it any easier for me to get into a solid graduate program? GPA was low because of poor effort and distractions during undergrad, not because I can't handle the academics. I am confident that I will be more focused and perform better in any masters program."

As the title states I'm trying to decide whether to get my MS in CS or Cybersecurity

**My Background:** 

Bachelor of Science in Physiology but decided to have a career change a while back and taught myself software development and have since worked for several fortune 500 companies as a Software Engineer (at least that's what HR says my title is 🤷‍♂️).

Recently I decided to apply to grad school to advance my career and technical/theoretical understanding of computer science. However I'm also interested in cybersecurity and recently participated in a couple of CTFs which I found to be really enjoyable (minus some of the forensic stuff 😅) . 

**Some Concerns and Additional Questions:** 

Not sure if this concern is worth mentioning but Im worried if I get my masters in Cybersecurity that it would pigeon hole me and employers would only look at me for security roles for the rest of my life. 

For those in security does a program with the NSA Center of Excellence in Information Assurance, a Center of Excellence in Research, and a Center of Excellence in Cyber Operations designations mean much to employers and the community as a whole? Also are certifications still required even with a degree in Cybersecurity?

&amp;#x200B;

**Grad schools I have applied to/admitted to:**

|School|Program|US News Ranking for Computer Science (if thats your kinda thing)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Johns Hopkins |Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity |25|
|UTSA |Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity |119|
|NYU |Trying to decide whether to apply for CS or Cybersecurity|30|
|Illinois |Considering there online Masters in CS|5|

All the schools above have the NSA designations mentioned above.

3011,cscareerquestions,Thoughts on Pass/Failing CS Classes?,"Freshman, taking two core CS classes (ARM Assembly and C++)

Being off campus has seriously hurt my ability to learn some concepts and I'm finishing some programs right now with errors that I can not solve for the life of me, and I don't have the on-campus resources like a TA and office hours. 

I'm not going to fail the classes, worst case scenario for C++ is a B, but I have scholarships I need to hold and taking a Pass over the B would probably help my GPA.

Do you guys think taking the Pass over a grade will hinder job opportunists or look bad on my transcript in the future?

Then, more or less on my own, I made a plugin for the company's primary program used to carry out their workflow. This was a deal that took about a month, because I had to re-write spaghetti code from an unfinished plugin into a completely different product. I asked for a raise, and they instead gave me a meager bonus compared to the time I spent on the projects and the code I wrote. They also told me that my initiative would be rewarded, and that people in this company are acknowledged for going ""above and beyond.""

The two majors are fairly similar but I’ve been worried about getting a job right out of undergrad since I’ve heard CS majors are typically more “marketable.” The main thing that’s holding me back from definitively majoring in CS is the fact that I’ve taken coding classes in high school and through a summer camp yet I eventually hit a roadblock at some point in my learning. This discouraged me and I put myself in this mindset that I’ll never succeed as a CS major, let alone as a software developer. However, I’m really intrigued by the problem solving aspect of CS and the career and growth opportunities that pursuing CS can provide me, given that I push and better myself along the way. I’m currently dabbling in some free coding resources specifically Python, and learning more about CS in general just to get back at it and hopefully make a decision by the time I get to college.

Does anyone know if Google's Foo Bar Coding Challenge can be started at any time? I don't want to start level 1 until I really feel confident, so are we allowed to wait?

Thanks for any input."
3051,cscareerquestions,MBA with an interest in Data Science courses (BrainStation),"Hello Everyone - I am a recent MBA graduate with a strong interest in all things data. I currently am a Manager of FP&amp;A and am thinking that a jump toward Data science would not only enhance my current skills but also bring me closer to work that I find fulfilling and meaningful. Recently graduating from an MBA program has basically shut the door on any formal university degree in Computer Science/Data Science but I have seen courses for a few thousands dollars from places like BrainStation.io where the courses contain learning Python, cleaning and analyzing data, regression, classification,  machine learning techniques, and visualization and presentation of data. 

My question is does anyone have any experience in these type of ad hoc classes and whether or not they would be worth it. Could you really consider yourself on your way to being a data scientist by adding these skills to a current MBA or are you at a loss without having a degree in computer science?

Thanks"
3052,cscareerquestions,Is a lot of web development CRUD with CMS platforms?,"I’m a software developer and work for an agency that develops websites that are backed by content management systems. Most of my background is with line-of-business software, but this is my first role at an agency where I’m helping build websites for customers.

I have to admit, I’m pretty disappointed and bored. It seems that most of the projects are CRUD apps with little or no opportunities to write business logic or algorithms or use object oriented design. The CMS pretty much does all of that for me. My job is basically just creating fields for the CMS admin so that data can be displayed on the frontend.

Is this an accurate description of web development today? Are content management systems widely used in most web projects? Or is it perhaps only the case when working on non-line-of-business software?"
3053,cscareerquestions,Fields with Entry Level Jobs,"I graduated in Dec 2018 with an EE degree and have been working as a project manager for the past 1.5 years. I've really decided I want a job in tech and I've slowly been working on learning as much as I can while working full time. I've mainly focused on learning Python as well as other CS fundamentals. I'm going to completely focus my efforts on this career transition soon. I'm really struggling with what type of jobs to target. I'm very interested in topics like computer vision, machine learning, autonomous systems, and even data science in general. It seems like these fields all require experience and graduate level degrees. I am wondering, what type of entry level job could I work in to get experience that would help prepare me for this type of job? Assume I would also pursue some sort of masters further down the road as well. I'm really not that interested in becoming a web developer, I've taken some basic front end courses and didn't feel like I was that engaged. What other fields hire at the entry level? Should I be considering data engineering? I'm not terribly interested in hardware, but I think embedded systems may be a way to start out as well. I don't do any programming at my current job so my main goal is to find something where I would be building skills to start out in the industry."
3054,cscareerquestions,Do Live Programming Tests during interviews discriminate against older programmers?,[removed]
3055,cscareerquestions,Need Career Track Advice Please? I need to make a decision soon," Hello Everyone:

 I applied for a BS CS program in the only uni that is available to me right now and was rudely turned down because their BS ""is a prestigious program intended for those who want to become technical professionals and space is limited"" They stuck me in their BA program because apparently I would've had to do one or two semesters of pre-reqs to qualify for the BS program Their excuse being that since I was homeschooled my last year, the program doesn't take my transcript. So, they can only allow me to declare the BA as of now.

Now, I am stuck with a program that I hadn't planned out for. It has 15 free credits with it, and I have no idea what classes to take or minor to pursue.

My options would be a BA in CS with a minor in something else which I am not sure what would make sense. I could take up a minors in finance to prepare for an MBA.

But that seems like a waste of time from what I am hearing. My other option would be to spend the two semesters doing pre-reqs to then do the BS and set myself up for a master's? not sure if that is worth it either.

Thank you in advance for your help and input. I appreciate it!"
3056,cscareerquestions,Do Live Programming Tests discriminate against older programmers?,"30 years as a programmer.  And live programming tests kick my butt every time.  

O(n) questions?  uh....  I didn't learn those in college, and I've never needed to know for any of my work.  It's not running well?  Profile the code and move on. 

Write a solution to a problem in 5 minutes with people watching?  Um... write the requirements cleanly and I might have a chance.  Oh, I didn't understand the problem?  Try using English as a proper language then.  And no, I don't normally pair program.

Show your problem solving skills?   ...I've been solving problems for 30 years.  Just not on codepad.io.  Or on Zoom. 

I'm trying to figure out if I need more training, if I need to push back on the process harder, or just move on to another career.  Is it the process?  Is it me?  

But I'm really starting to feel tests like this discriminate against older programmers.  We're not as flexible, but we're knowledgeable.  But how do we change the process?  And is it worth it?"
